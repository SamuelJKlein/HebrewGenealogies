<h2>
Peleg, Joktan and the Table of Nations
</h2>
<p>
For two hundred pages this book has suggested that Hebrew genealogies are
mostly about identification, not succession, that they are often condensed,
that 35-55 generations are missing between Eber and Peleg and that Job was
born 8-9 generations before Peleg. Now Genesis ten appears, a fly in the
ointment, two brothers to smite this tidy scheme. One brother continues the
line to Christ; the other populates Arabia. They are placed in the fourth
generation after the Flood.

    <sup>25</sup>
    To Eber were born two sons: the name of the one was Peleg, for in his
days the earth was divided, and his brother's name was Joktan.        <sup>26</sup>Joktan
</a>
fathered Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah, <sup>27</sup>Hadoram, Uzal,
Diklah, <sup>28</sup>Obal, Abimael, Sheba, <sup>29</sup>Ophir, Havilah, and
Jobab; all these were the sons of Joktan. Genesis 10:25-29.
</p>
<p>
Not so fast. "Brother" is one of those elastic relational words used in
both narrow and broad senses. The narrow sense would mean these two
brothers had the same immediate father and lived at the same time. The
broad sense would merely mean they both descended from the same forefather.
Nehemiah 5:1 uses "brother" that way. Poor Jews called rich Jews brothers.
They were brothers in the sense that they were all descendants of Abraham
who lived 1500 years earlier.
</p>
<p>
Similarly, Peleg and Joktan were brothers in the sense that Eber was their
forefather. Genesis ten does not spoil the view of this book but provides
another example to illustrate it. Both Peleg and Joktan descended from
Eber. Peleg was born 35-55 generations after Eber but is named first due to
importance (he continued the line to Christ). Much earlier Joktan and his
descendants populated much of Arabia when Ice Age storms provided the water
to cover it with vegetation. Out of the millions born during the 35-55
generation gap, Scripture names only a few-Joktan and his 13 sons (who may
also have been "sons" in the broad sense) and those found in the Book of
Job. This early populating of Arabia provides background for Job, the
Patriarchs and Israel.
</p>
<h3>
Table of Nations
</h3>
<p>
The story of Peleg and Joktan appears in Genesis ten which is commonly
called the Table of Nations. That is a misnomer. It does not record the
rise of each nation after the Flood. It is neither a record of the
repopulation of the earth, a genealogy nor a chronology. Rather it appears
for a specific purpose and therefore is very selective. It was provided to
inform Israel of the background of her neighbors as the following will
show.
</p>
<h4>
Selectivity of the Table of Nations
</h4>
<p>
First, the Table of Nations was extremely selective. On the Ark were Noah
and his wife plus their three sons and three daughters-in-law-eight adults
but no children. After the Flood those three sons fathered 16 named sons
(5.33 sons per father) and presumably about that many daughters. This
record of first-generation sons is most likely complete. But with the
second generation the record becomes selective. From Japheth's seven sons,
just seven grandsons are named or just one son per father. Of Shem's five
sons, only five grandsons are named. Again, just one son per father. But of
Ham's four sons, 26 grandsons are named (over six sons per father). Many
reasons are suggested for this such as not enough daughters to go around,
untimely deaths, a preference for remaining single or even violence. Like
Adam and Eve's oldest, they all possessed old sin natures. But most likely
the other nine had sons that are not mentioned due to selectivity.
</p>
<p>
If the record of second-generation sons suggests selectivity, the record of
third-generation sons shouts it-only three sons are recorded and two might
be "sons" in the broad sense. Looking at this account another way, the 36
first generation sons should have produced 80 second generation sons. Those
80 should have produced 400 third generation sons. Instead of 400, just one
third generation son is certain.
</p>
<p>
God commanded the Ark survivors to fill the earth with people. Either the
record is extremely incomplete or the human race was heading towards
extinction. Since repopulation was happening, the record is the problem. It
is selective. The fourth generation is even worse-only two sons are
named-the two brothers-and neither were truly fourth generation sons, so in
effect, no fourth-generation son is listed.
</p>
<p>
Looking at this selectivity another way, Ham had four sons and sons are
listed for three (75%). Shem had five sons and sons are listed for two
(40%). Japheth had seven sons, but sons for just two are listed (29%). What
became of the unnamed offspring of the other nine first-generation sons and
34 second-generation sons? Though not mentioned in Genesis 10, we know much
about some from history. The Medes descended from Japheth's son Madai.
Descending from Shem's sons Elam and Asshur were the Elamites and infamous
Assyrians of Isaiah's day. But not all are so obvious. The identity of some
is disputed; others remain unidentified. Without question the Table of
Nations is selective.
</p>
<h4>
Purpose of the Table of Nations
</h4>
<p>
The Table of Nations is selective because of its purpose. These post-Flood
people began to form people groups and nations. The record focuses on those
nations that impacted the Hebrews. This is the reason for the Table of
Nation's specific content. Nearness to or impact upon the Hebrews was the
primary reason in deciding which names to include. The most space was given
to Ham and his progeny. Both the Promised Land that God gave to Abraham's
descendants and the surrounding nations were mostly occupied by them.
</p>
<p>
Ham's son Canaan first settled the land of Canaan. No less than 11 sons are
listed for him. These names occur again and again through Scripture as
Israel struggled with them. Ham's son Egypt and his seven sons settled the
land of Egypt. That land also had a major impact on the Hebrews. In Egypt
Jacob's sons and grandsons grew to a population exceeding two million
souls. Egypt eventually enslaved them. Descendants of Ham's oldest son,
Cush and his six sons, are listed because they populated areas near Goshen
where the Hebrews sojourned in Egypt for 430-years. Moses, the editor of
Genesis, would have been very aware of Egypt's Cushite neighbors. No sons
are listed for Ham's other son Put most likely because they settled in
lands more distant from Israel.
</p>
<p>
While Shem had five sons the sons of only two are mentioned. Shelah
continued the line leading to Christ and while Aram and his four sons
provide context for the history of Israel. This makes sense since Aram was
the father of the Aramaeans who populated Syria among other places. The
Aramaeans were very significant in the life of Israel. By the time of
Christ, the Aramaic language had replaced Hebrew in everyday life. Aram was
also the father of Uz who established the land in which Job lived. To have
possessed a large amount of land in Uz, Job would have had to be a direct
descendant of Uz. Shem's other three sons, Elam, Asshur and Lud,
contributed huge populations to the Near East and all are named before Aram
but, amazingly, nothing is said of them.
</p>
<p>
Sons of just two of Japheth's seven sons are named. From Gomer came many
European peoples; but maybe Gomer's three sons are listed out of respect to
him as Japheth's firstborn. Another, Javan and his four sons, leads to the
Greeks and other Northeastern Mediterranean peoples. These would be
significant in later Hebrew history as the Israelites interacted with those
bordering the Mediterranean Sea.
</p>
<p>
Puzzling is the naming of Cush's descendants, Sheba and Dedan who are said
to come from Cush's son, Raamah. Possibly Sheba and Dedan were named
because they settled in Arabia and later intermarried with the descendants
of Joktan and Abraham. They also are found in the Book of Job.
</p>
<p>
Since God would give Abraham's descendants the land of Canaan, they needed
to know about their neighbors and close relatives. Nearness to or impact
upon the Hebrews was the primary reason in deciding which names to include
in the Table of Nations. Yes, the Table of Nations was both selective and
deliberate.
</p>
<h4>
Other unique features of the Table
</h4>
<p>
While the firstborn is usually named first, the Table places the record of
Shem's descendants (Genesis 10:21-31) after those of Japheth (Genesis
10:2-5) and Ham (Genesis 10:6-20). Several times Scripture deals with less
important sons before getting to the most important son, the heir.
Ishmael's genealogy (Genesis 25:12-18) precedes Isaac's genealogy (Genesis
25:19 and following). Esau's genealogy (Genesis 36) comes long before
Jacob's genealogy (Genesis 46).
</p>
<p>
The amount of space given to the descendants of each of Noah's sons also is
telling. Nine verses of names are devoted to ham's descendants (10:6-8,
13-18). Three verses of names are devoted to Japheth's descendants (10:2-4)
and seven verses of names are devoted to Shem's descendants (10:22-24,
26-29). In the midst of the 70 descendants found in Genesis ten,
considerable space is devoted to three developments. First is the rise of
Nimrod and the expansion of his power (10:8-12, 5 verses). Second is the
territory of the Canaanites (10:19, 1 verse). Third is Eber's two "sons"
(10:25-30, 6 verses). Thus in 28 verses of Genesis ten, 12 verses are
devoted to an explanation of certain names rather than listing names.
</p>
<p>
The broad use of "father" is clearly seen in Genesis 10:21 which says "To
Shem, also, the father of all the children of Eber&#8230;." In this sense
all the children of the grandson (Eber) were the children of the
grandfather (Shem). When did Shem initiate this line leading to Eber's
children, Peleg and Joktan? It began two years after the Flood when he
fathered Arpachshad. The time two years) was when he began the line, not
when he fathered Peleg just as the time in Genesis 11 was when the line was
continued, not particularly when the named son was born.
</p>
<p>
Possibly Arpachshad enjoyed the unique honor of being the first person born
in the post-Flood world. While Scripture doesn't say that, it does say he
was born two years after the Flood, i.e., after the beginning of the Flood
(Genesis 11:10) and does not indicate that another person was born before
him. Surprisingly he is named third, not first, in the list of Shem's five
sons in the Table of Nations. Elam is the first name and Asshur is the
second. Both had an enormous impact on the Near East in their day.
</p>
<p>
Elam appears again and again in Scripture. By the time Abraham arrived in
the Promised Land, Chedorlaomer, King of Elam, had extended his scepter all
the way to Sodom and Gomorrah, one thousand trade-route miles west and
south of Elam (Genesis 14:4). Fifteen hundred years later Elam would be a
major part of the Persian Empire that ended the Babylonian captivity.
Asshur fathered the Assyrians that continued to be a great and powerful
people in northeastern Mesopotamia. In terms of prominence these sons
dwarfed Arpachshad. Maybe that is why he is listed third even though he was
the firstborn. Clearly, birth order does not always dictate the order in
which sons are listed in Scripture.
</p>
<p>
Sons were sometimes named for famous forefathers or relatives. Two clear
cases are found right here in the very beginning of the repopulating of the
earth after the Flood. Cush's oldest son was named Seba (very close to
"Sheba") and his second was named Havilah. Cush had a grandson named Sheba
while one of Joktan's 13 sons was also named Sheba. Joktan named another of
his 13 sons Havilah. Because the same names were used over and over in
Bible days, one must be careful when identifying people in Scripture.
</p>
<p>
The Table names 13 sons for Joktan and 11 for Canaan. Frequently those with
many sons had multiple wives. While Jacob fathered 12 sons, they came
through four wives. Abraham's brother Nahor had eight sons by one wife and
four by another. Abraham himself had eight sons by three women. Esau had
three wives to bear his 12 sons. King David had even more wives for his
many sons. How many wives Joktan had in fathering 13 sons or Canaan had in
fathering eleven sons is not stated. It would be conjecture to say all the
sons of each father in this Table came from one wife. In determining
population growth, it would likewise be a mistake to average the listed
sons and then conclude that all males had an average of that many sons.
</p>
<p>
After naming five sons and two grandsons of Cush in Genesis 10:7, verse
eight says "Cush fathered Nimrod." Nimrod was not named in the list of
Cush's sons but separately said to be fathered by Cush. This is a device
for sake of emphasis. Scripture continues by devoting more text about
Nimrod and his kingdoms than it does to the entire paragraph on Japheth.
Nimrod's Babylon has opposed God from this early time all the way through
the Book of Revelation and to the present day. Abraham's seed needed a
strong warning about this kingdom that wars against God and therefore
against Israel. Here is the warning right in the middle of the Table of
Nations. Genesis ten is far more than a record of the repopulation of the
world after the Flood.
</p>
<p>
While this chapter is short (just four pages), it is extremely important
because it corrects a common misunderstanding about Genesis ten that
obscures the 35-55 generation omission between Eber and Peleg. Genesis ten
is not a Table of Nations. Rather, it relates the origin of people groups
that would impact Israel in its mission of producing the Messiah.
</p>
<p>
Critical to that purpose were Peleg and Joktan (Genesis 10:25-30). In the
past expositors noted that Peleg's name meant "divided." They concluded his
name referred to the division of languages when God judged those building
the Tower of Babel. A careful study of his name indicates the division is
associated with water, not languages. Thus, he was named at the end of the
Ice Age when the two-mile-thick ice sheet in the earth's north and south
had melted, raising sea level to divide the continents and islands by
water. Joktan was important because his descendants established one of the
earliest population centers during the Ice Age-Arabia. Scripture not only
states that he had 13 sons but names each of them in Genesis 10.
