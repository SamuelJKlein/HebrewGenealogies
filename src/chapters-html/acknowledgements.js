<p>
In a sense the author of <em>HB</em> is a compiler, taking the ideas of
numerous creationists and other inerrancy believers and stitching them
together to build a case for omitted generations in Shem's list. Among
those I salute for contributing key ideas found in <em>HB</em> are Merrill
F. Unger, John Whitcomb, Henry Morris II, Bernard E. Northrup, Col. R. B.
Thieme, Jr. (military strategy in Genesis 14), Walt Brown, John
Baumgardner, Larry Vardiman and John Sanford. Without their original
insights this book could not have been written.
