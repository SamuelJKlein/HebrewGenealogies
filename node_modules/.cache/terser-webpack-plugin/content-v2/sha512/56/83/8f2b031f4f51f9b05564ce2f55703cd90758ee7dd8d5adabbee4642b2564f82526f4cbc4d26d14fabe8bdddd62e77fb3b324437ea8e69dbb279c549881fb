thousand years. The problem has to do with whether Shem&#39;s genealogy in Genesis 11 is complete or not, and if not, where and how many names are omitted. Historically, the Church has interpreted it as complete, but this view conflicts with numerous other Scriptures. Further, recent discoveries of huge numbers of cuneiform tablets testify to an earlier Flood date than is found by adding the numbers in Shem&#39;s genealogy. We propose that Shem&#39;s list has been shortened from 45-65 names to ten which means the Flood of Noah occurred nearer 4000 BC than 2500 BC. This solution eliminates the many biblical conflicts, confirms recent cuneiform finds and comes with a book full of biblical support. <br><br><br></p><a href=\"/The-Hidden-Beauty-of-the-Hebrew-Genealogies.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" download=\"Name\"><button class=\"btn btn-primary\" style=\"font-size:2rem;color:teal;background-color:white;\"> Download PDF <span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-download\"></span></button></a><a href=\"/executive-summary\"><button class=\"btn btn-primary\" style=\"font-size:2rem;color:teal;background-color:white;margin-left:10px;\"> Read Here <span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-book\"></span></button></a><p style=\"font-size:1.3rem;\"> The Hidden Beauty of Hebrew Genealogies: Harmonizing Old Testament Words and Numbers, Fifth Edition, 12/2021.

He=l()(Ie,[[\"render\",we]]);var xe=He,Ee={html:'<h2>\\n    Executive Summary\\n</h2>\\n<p>\\n    <em>Hidden Beauty</em>\\n    offers to the Body of Christ a promising solution to a nagging and\\n    contentious Bible problem that has escaped explanation for two thousand\\n    years. The problem has to do with whether Shem\\'s genealogy in Genesis 11 is\\n    complete or not, and if not, where and how many names are omitted.\\n    Historically, the Church has interpreted it as complete, but this view\\n    conflicts with numerous other Scriptures. Further, recent discoveries of\\n    huge numbers of cuneiform tablets testify to an earlier Flood date than is\\n    found by adding the numbers in Shem\\'s genealogy. We propose that Shem\\'s\\n    list has been shortened from 45-65 names to ten which means the Flood of\\n    Noah occurred nearer 4000 BC than 2500 BC. This solution eliminates the\\n    many biblical conflicts, confirms recent cuneiform finds and comes with a\\n    book full of biblical support.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    One of those many biblical conflicts involves the Levi-Aaron genealogy.\\n    Four times the sequence of Levi-Kohath-Amram-Aaron is stated or inferred (I\\n    Chronicles 6:1-3; Numbers 3:17-20, 26:57-59; Exodus 6:16, 18, 20). The\\n    thinking goes that if it omits names, even though those passages give no\\n    hint that names are omitted, maybe Shem\\'s list also omits names. In Levi\\'s\\n    case the issue turns on whether Israel sojourned in Egypt 215 or 430-years.\\n    If 215-years, it could be complete; if 430-years, it cannot be complete.\\n    Thus, many of those who add Shem\\'s numbers have supported 215-years in a\\n    never-ending 2000-year controversy. When it comes to the lives of Abraham\\n    and Jacob, they have invoked unusual explanations to uphold 215-years. The\\n    key verse, Exodus 12:40, allowed either interpretation until scholars in\\n    modern times corrected a textual problem in it. Now it clearly states, \"The\\n    time that the people of Israel lived in Egypt was 430-years.\" (ESV). Levi\\'s\\n    list is incomplete.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    For 65 years I have studied the Bible as inerrant which means that God was\\n    behind the writing of every word of the Bible so its original documents\\n    were error free. Since 1998 I have had a growing realization of the problem\\nwith Shem\\'s list. More recently I began searching the Bible for an answer.    <strong> </strong>The Shem passage is clear-when Arpachshad had lived 35\\n    years, he fathered Shelah; when Shelah had lived 30 years he fathered Eber,\\n    etc., etc., (Genesis 11:12 and following). Since God moved the writers of\\n    Scripture and God cannot lie, people of faith are obligated to take those\\n    numbers literally. While most Evangelical Old Testament scholars suspect\\n    Shem\\'s list is incomplete, they can\\'t explain how or where.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Slowly it dawned on me that Hebrew genealogies had a different orientation\\n    than the genealogies of most other people groups. Their purpose served to\\n    identify descendants with forefathers and forefathers with descendants\\n    rather than establish legal descent. In the thinking of the Hebrew all male\\n    descendants were the sons of their forefathers and all forefathers were the\\n    fathers of their descendants.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    This thinking is reflected in the very first verse of the New Testament:\\n    \"Jesus Christ, the son of David.\" Since David lived 1000 years before\\n    Christ, calling Jesus the \"son of David\" is using \"son\" in the broad sense\\n    of the word. Jesus was a descendant of David. The Hebrews used the other\\n    common family terms such as \"father,\" \"brother\" and even \"to bear\" (the\\n    mother\\'s part), \"to beget\" (the father\\'s part) in the same way, i.e., in\\n    the broad sense as well as in the conventional narrow sense. My favorite\\n    verse illustrating this concept is I Chronicles 4:1 which uses \"son\" in\\n    both narrow and broad senses: \"The sons of Judah: Perez, Hezron, Carmi, Hur\\n    and Shobal.\" Perez is the only immediate son of Judah in the list. You\\n    would never know from the verse that Hezron was a grandson, Hur and Shobal\\n    were great grandsons and Carmi was a distant descendant. Yet this was one\\n    way the Hebrews used \"son\" and other family terms.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    In Shem\\'s case not only is the word \"beget\" found, but also the age of the\\n    father when he begat his son. It would seem that this additional\\n    information requires \"beget\" to be understood in the narrow sense, but it\\n    doesn\\'t. Levi\\'s list shows how to take the begetting age. In a Hebrew\\n    genealogical list factual data about a parent refers to the next\\n    generation, whether named or omitted. If omitted, \"beget/bear\" is used in\\n    the broad sense of a descendant born further down the line.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    But where and how many generations are missing in Shem\\'s case? The Bible\\n    gives an overwhelming clue. All those who died before the Flood lived about\\n    the same number of years. On the other hand, the longevity of those born\\n    after the Flood steadily declined from 438 to 70 years (Genesis 11:12;\\n    Psalm 90:10). While there were special cases the overall decline appears\\n    small to begin with, then varies from four to eight years per generation\\n    before eventually declining to about two or three years per generation and\\n    finally ceasing. But there is one glaring exception. The decline between\\n    the third and fourth names is 61% of the total decline. By dividing this\\n    huge decline by the per-generation decline and making other adjustments,\\n    35-55 generations seem to be missing (1300-1900 years). What clarified this\\n    issue? Here was the break through: coming to realize that the Flood itself\\n    was so violent that it permanently cut human longevity in half.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The multiplication of Noah\\'s descendants totally agrees with the appearance\\n    of the world\\'s first advanced societies. An advanced society is defined as\\n    one that has developed a written language. After the Ark came to rest where\\n    the mountains of Ararat eventually arose, Noah\\'s descendants migrated to\\n    the plains of Southern Mesopotamia and built a city (Genesis 8-11). In\\n    seeing this city God said that now nothing they proposed would be\\n    impossible (Genesis 11:6) so He confused their tongues. Speaking different\\n    languages forced them to spread out. After a time one group reduced its\\n    language to writing. Secular history has concluded that the very first\\n    society to develop a written language was the Southern Mesopotamian people\\n    of Sumer about 3000 BC. The Egyptians soon followed with hieroglyphics.\\n    Other Near East peoples adopted their languages to Sumer\\'s cuneiform\\n    script. Secular history confirms Scripture\\'s record with regard to the\\n    location of the world\\'s first advanced societies.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Noah\\'s Flood brought on the Ice Age which lasted possibly a thousand years\\n    and impacted all of his descendants for centuries. Those who settled in the\\n    upper latitudes resorted to survival tactics-stone tools and caves. Those\\n    in the lower latitudes experienced powerful and frequent rain storms that\\n    caused permanent vegetation in areas of the Near East now desert. As a\\n    result, large populations developed in one place while cave men fought to\\n    survive elsewhere at the same time. Job lived about 16 generations before\\n    Abraham, dying at the age of 280. His book speaks of these heavy rains,\\n    numerous other ice age phenomena, an extensive population in Arabia and\\n    even dinosaurs in the Jordan Valley, all forgotten by Abraham\\'s day.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    When one understands how to take Hebrew genealogies and applies that\\n    knowledge to Shem\\'s list, dozens of misinterpretations of Scripture are\\ncorrected and Scripture stands with greater trustworthiness and authority.    <em>Hidden Beauty</em> is long because it must overcome much\\n    disinformation.

Maybe they are too busy;\\n    maybe this issue is not that important. But this does not mean that\\n    competent scholars with doctors\\' degrees have not reviewed this material.\\n    The author has communicated with three who have encouraged the publishing\\n    of these ideas. All three are senior scholars at or near the end of\\n    fruitful lifetime ministries in teaching the Old Testament.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    In contrast those who reject the idea that Shem\\'s list is incomplete do not\\n    have this kind of experience or even these skills. Chapter 17 explains the\\n    difference between true scholars and those who add Shem\\'s numbers to\\n    declare the date of the Flood. Some of the latter have corresponded\\n    personally with me. Their explanations and arguments are unconvincing and\\n    without merit. For the sake of unity in the Body of Christ I will not\\n    identify them. Love among the brethren is the greater requirement.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The true issue of this book is the practice of Scripture. Is it true that\\n    it uses family terms in a broad sense as well as in the standard narrow\\n    sense? Is it true that the description of Amram and Jochebed was true of\\n    the parents of their unnamed immediate descendant and that the Hebrew verb\\n    \"to bear\" refers to bearing Miriam, Aaron and Moses in the broad sense of\\n    being born somewhere down the line? Is it true that there is a 61% decrease\\n    in longevity between Eber and Peleg and other than this enormous decrease,\\n    the average generational decrease ranged between a high of six or seven\\n    years and declined to zero by the end of Moses life? These biblical uses\\n    are clear and they are the point of this book. Thus, the Flood occurred\\n    nearer 4000 B.C. than 2500 B.C.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Maybe someday the needed Old Testament Hebrew authority will come forward.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Meanwhile, a tribute to many who have contributed ideas to this book. In a\\n    sense the author of <em>HB</em> is a compiler. He has taken the ideas of\\n    numerous creationists and other inerrancy believers and stitched them\\n    together to build this case for omitted generations in Shem\\'s list. Among\\n    these we should salute the outstanding ideas found in HB of Merrill F.\\n    Unger, John Whitcomb, Henry Morris II, Bernard E. Northrup, Col. R.

For example, advanced societies thrived\\n    across the Near East when the numbers of Shem\\'s genealogy are used to\\n    determine the date of Noah\\'s Flood. There is no error in Scripture so we\\n    need to understand the method that the Jewish people used in compiling\\n    genealogies and read accordingly. With this help we can affirm the\\n    inerrancy of Biblical statements without denying the overwhelming testimony\\n    of historical studies.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Furthermore, if we understand the OT practice of condensing genealogies, we\\n    will not unnecessarily give people an excuse to attack the Bible as being\\n    unreliable. Therefore, such insight is very important. In fact, it is so\\n    important that we call those methods \"the hidden beauty of Hebrew\\n    genealogies.\" This hidden beauty focuses on identity in the family line,\\n    not necessarily the succession from father to son, and sometimes includes\\n    significant gaps. Such understanding harmonizes those words and numbers of\\n    the Old Testament often viewed as contradictions and clumsily\\n    reinterpreted.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The Executive Summary (pages 5-6) explains the conclusion of this book-that\\n    Shem\\'s genealogy of Genesis 11 omits 35-55 generations. This chapter\\n    introduces the first evidence for that conclusion. The Levi-Aaron list\\n    covers about 500 years which includes the 430-years Israel dwelt in Egypt.\\n    Yet it contains just four people (Levi-Kohath-Amram-Aaron). We are given\\n    much information about them, even their overlapping life spans which fail\\n    to bridge those 500 years. The list omits up to a dozen names.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    This position has not been the view of the church historically. The reason\\n    has to do with the number of years Israel sojourned in Egypt. Whether it\\n    was 215 or 430-years has been a continuing controversy for 2000 years. The\\n    preponderance of Scriptural evidence favors 430 but historical evidence\\n    supported 215. For instance, the Septuagint (i.e., the Greek translation of\\n    the Old Testament) says Israel sojourned in Canaan and Egypt 430-years.\\n    Early authorities like Josephus concurred. The church fathers added their\\n    \"Amen.\" Because the Hebrew text of the key passage, Exodus 12:40, had a\\n    problem, it could be understood to mean that 430-years was the total time\\n    in Canaan <strong>and</strong>Egypt. Events in the lives of Abraham and\\n    Jacob were then erroneously interpreted to support a 215-year Egyptian\\n    sojourn. As a result, the Levi-Aaron list was viewed as complete. To this\\n    day some still insist that Israel only sojourned in Egypt 215-years.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    While 430-years in Egypt only adds a few years to the antiquity of Noah\\'s\\n    Flood, an incomplete Levi list opens the door to other Old Testament\\n    genealogies being incomplete. An abbreviated Shem list could push the date\\n    for the Flood back hundreds or even thousands of years. To find the\\n    approximate time of the Flood, <em>Hidden Beauty</em> must address the many\\n    controversies that have clouded this question. In the process the book has\\n    become very long.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Before proceeding, it must be stated that foundational to this book is the\\n    doctrine of the inerrancy of Scripture, the biblical truth that God so\\n    moved its authors that they wrote His message without error. It applies to\\n    every word of the original writings. It means that all Scripture was\\n    originally in harmony with the original writings of all other\\n    Scripture-that no statement contradicted any other statement in its\\n    original writing. It also means that all Scripture is important, that every\\n    word is equally true, that no Scripture should be dismissed, overlooked or\\n    regarded as insignificant. The church has restated this doctrine at\\n    critical times in history. Most recently in the Fall of 1978 an\\n    international gathering of nearly 300 noted evangelical scholars produced\\n    \"The Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy\" which reaffirmed this truth\\n    in clear but precise terms. <a href=\"\" name=\"_ftnref1\" title=\"\"><sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup></a>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Because Scripture is God\\'s word, it is the final authority on every issue\\n    it addresses. In this book every effort is made to answer each issue solely\\n    on the basis of what the Bible itself says. After determining what\\n    Scripture says, the secular view of where and when advanced societies first\\n    developed will be discussed because surprisingly it supports what the Bible\\n    has said all along. Also, by way of introduction the following purpose and\\n    function of Hebrew genealogies must ever be in the minds of those who\\n    discuss them.\\n</p>\\n\\n    <h4 id=\"overview-of-hebrew-genealogies\">Overview of Hebrew Genealogies</h4>\\n\\n<p>\\n    Most peoples, and especially the West, have used genealogies and\\n    chronologies to display an unbroken list of immediate relationships such as\\n    father-son, rulers, priests, etc. In contrast, the basic idea of Hebrew\\n    genealogies was identity, not succession. Hebrews identified descendants\\n    with their forefathers and forefathers with their descendants. It could be\\n    boiled down to this: all descendants were in the loins of their forefathers\\n    and all forefathers were the fathers of their descendants. It was perfectly\\n    accurate in Hebrew usage to say B was the son of A or to say G was the son\\n    of A when actually generations B-F came between A and G.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    For example, Hebrew genealogies could be as specific as Adam knew Eve who\\n    conceived Cain (Genesis 4:1) or as broad as \"Jesus Christ, the son of\\n    David\" (Matthew 1:1). Cain was the immediate result of the union of Adam\\n    and Eve. There were no intermediate generations between the parents and\\n    their son. This is the narrow use in Hebrew thinking (A begat B). On the\\n    other hand, one thousand years separated David from his distant son Jesus\\n    Christ. This is the broad use of genealogies in Scripture (A begat G). The\\n    broad use could compact many generations into one, yet be perfectly\\n    truthful. The intentional skipping or omitting of names could be considered\\n    condensing or abbreviating. It was beautifully efficient and simple.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Matthew made no error when he wrote \"Jesus Christ, the son of David.\" His\\n    purpose was to identify Jesus Christ with David genealogically. Authors of\\n    Scripture determined the degree of completeness of a blood line, often\\n    providing only as many names as their purpose required. Those in the day of\\n    any particular author would discern whether his list was complete or not,\\n    but as time passed this discernment became more difficult. In time, even\\n    Bible scholars, misunderstanding this broader use of Hebrew genealogies,\\n    began to wrest the Scripture with their interpretations.\\n</p>\\n\\n    <strong> </strong>\\n<h4 id=\"condensing-a-genealogical-list-a-clear-ot-example\">Condensing a Genealogical List-A Clear OT Example</h4>\\n\\n\\n<p>\\n    A 215-year sojourn by Jacob and his descendants in Egypt is an essential\\n    element in the historic view that the Flood occurred about 2348 BC\\n    according to Archbishop James Ussher. His monumental work, <em>Annals of the World</em>, first published in Latin in\\n    1650, used the\\n    typical approach of working back from later known dates to Abraham. This\\n    method then added the years when each father in Shem\\'s genealogy of Genesis\\n    11 had his heir to finally reach the Flood date.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    A 430-year Egyptian sojourn adds a mere 215-years to this date. But\\n    recognizing a 430-year Egyptian sojourn introduces a game-changing\\n    precedent. It means that many names are omitted in Levi\\'s genealogy that\\n    appears to be complete. Since the Shem list has characteristics similar to\\n    the Levi-Aaron list, it opens the door to omitted names in that list which\\n    some vehemently deny.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    While many have been told that Scripture is confusing about the years\\n    Israel spent in Egypt, the next chapter will show that no less than God\\n    Himself witnessed to a 430-year sojourn there. But that is not all. Moses\\n    likewise witnessed to 430-years in Egypt. Then over a millennium later\\n    Stephen affirmed God\\'s word and Paul affirmed Moses\\' word. On the other\\n    hand, nowhere does Scripture state that Israel sojourned in Egypt\\n    215-years. Nowhere!\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Then where did the idea of 215-years in Egypt come from? It was primarily\\n    from a deduction made from the following words in Exodus and Numbers which\\n    lists Kohath as a son of Levi, Amram as a son of Kohath and Aaron as a son\\n    of Amram:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>\\n    <strong>\\n        These are the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations:\\n        Gershon, Kohath, and Merari, the years of the life of Levi being 137\\n        years. <sup>18</sup>The sons of Kohath: Amram&#8230;, the years of the\\n        life of Kohath being 133 years. <sup>20</sup>Amram took as his wife\\n        Jochebed his father\\'s sister, and she bore him Aaron and Moses, the\\n        years of the life of Amram being 137 years. Exodus 6:16, 18, 20.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong><sup>58</sup></strong>\\n    <strong>\\n        These are the clans of Levi: &#8230;of Kohath, the clan of the\\n        Kohathites; &#8230;And Kohath was the father of Amram. <sup>59</sup>The\\n        name of Amram\\'s wife was Jochebed the daughter of Levi, who was born to\\n        Levi in Egypt. And she bore to Amram Aaron and Moses and Miriam their\\n        sister. Numbers 26:58-59.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    While the two narratives appear to be a full and complete record of descent\\n    (Levi-Kohath-Amram-Aaron), the following pages conclusively demonstrate\\n    that these genealogical records are abbreviated. But the historic approach\\n    views them as complete which requires rewriting much other Scripture. In so\\n    doing the cardinal rule of interpretation-inerrancy-is violated. This book\\n    will apply the broader concept of the nature and function of Hebrew\\n    genealogies to such passages. With this approach those violations of\\n    Scripture will be eliminated.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The passages above report three generations leading to Aaron-that of Levi,\\n    Kohath and Amram. No one disputes the relationships in these four\\n    generations, i.e., that Kohath was a direct descendant of Levi, that Amram\\n    was a direct descendant of Kohath and that Aaron was a direct descendant of\\n    Amram. When Jacob moved his people to Egypt, Levi was about 46 years old so\\n    his sons may have been teenagers or even in their twenties. All Jacob\\'s\\n    male descendants accompanied him to Egypt except Joseph and his sons who\\n    were already there. Genesis 46:8-26 records that list and begins:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>\\n    <strong>\\n        Now these are the names of the descendants of Israel, who came into\\n        Egypt, Jacob and his sons, Reuben, Jacob\\'s firstborn, <sup>9</sup>and\\n        the sons of Reuben.&#8230; <sup>10</sup>The sons of Simeon&#8230;. <sup>11</sup>The sons of Levi: Gershon,\\n        Kohath and Merari. Genesis\\n        46:8-11.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Kohath is among the names in the list above. So he was born in Canaan\\n    before the move to Egypt. The next generation mentioned after Kohath was\\n    Amram. Exodus says Amram was a son of Kohath. Numbers agrees, saying Kohath\\n    was the father of Amram. Each passage validates the other. Both Exodus and\\n    Numbers report that Amram and his wife had children-Exodus reports the\\n    births of Aaron and Moses while Numbers reveals the names of three-Aaron,\\n    Moses and Miriam. The 215-year view teaches these four\\n    generations-Levi-Kohath-Amram-Aaron-are consecutive, i.e., immediate\\n    father-son relationships and span the 215-years in Egypt.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    How long of a sojourn in Egypt could they possibly span? Let\\'s calculate.\\n    Suppose each of these generations dwelling in Egypt fathered his named son\\n    in the last year of his life. This number would be the maximum number of\\n    years these four generations could have contributed to the total sojourn in\\n    Egypt if the genealogies were consecutive without any gaps or omissions.\\n    Then that number could be viewed in the light of a 215 or 430-year sojourn.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Calculations: Aaron was 83 at the time of the Exodus, so he accounts for 83\\n    years in Egypt (Exodus 7:7). Levi\\'s grandson, Amram lived 137 years (Exodus\\n    6:20), all of them in Egypt. Add: 137 + 83 = 220 years. None of Levi\\'s\\n    years in Egypt can count since his son Kohath was already alive when they\\n    moved to Egypt. The only father left to contribute years in Egypt is\\n    Kohath. How many years did he contribute? Scripture doesn\\'t tell his age\\n    when they arrived, so for contrast both the maximum and minimum years\\n    possible will be calculated.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <u>Kohath\\'s minimum age</u>\\n    : he was alive when they moved down to Egypt and he had a younger brother.\\n    If his younger brother had just been born, Kohath could have been as young\\n    as one year old.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <u>Kohath\\'s maximum age</u>\\n    : eleven sons were born to Jacob within a nine-year time span at uncle\\n    Laban\\'s place. Levi was #3 and Joseph was #11. Thus, Levi was born about\\n    two years into the nine-year time span while Joseph was born last so he was\\n    born about seven years later. This makes Levi about seven years older than\\n    Joseph. Scripture reveals that Joseph was 39 when his family joined him in\\n    Egypt; Levi would have been about 46 (39+7=46). At this time Jacob\\'s sons\\n    were starting families when they were very young, even younger than 20. If\\n    Levi\\'s second son, Kohath, was born when his father was just 20, he would\\n    have been 26 when they moved to Egypt.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <u>Maximum Range for the age of Kohath</u>\\n    : So Kohath could have been as young as one or as old as 26 when the family\\n    moved to Egypt. If he were just one year old, he would contribute the most\\n    number of years to the Egyptian sojourn. So that number will be found\\n    first. Kohath died at the age of 133 (Exodus 6:18) so he could have\\n    contributed as many as 132 years to Israel\\'s time in Egypt. Now the numbers\\n    are available to determine the absolute maximum number of years in Egypt if\\n    this genealogy (Levi-Kohath-Amram-Aaron) is complete. Aaron provides 83\\n    years. Amram provides another 137 years and Kohath could have provided up\\n    to 132 years. The total is 352 (83+137+132=352).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Three hundred fifty-two years is the maximum number of years these three\\n    named fathers could contribute towards Israel\\'s total sojourn in Egypt if\\n    this list is complete. Although, it is most unlikely that a father would\\n    have had his named heir in the very year he died at such advanced ages. For\\n    this to happen twice in a row is even more unlikely. As already noted,\\n    Jacob\\'s sons were starting families as early as the age of 20. But for now,\\n    the maximum possible number of years in Egypt has been found if this\\n    genealogy is complete. That total number of years, 352 years, is more than\\n    enough for a 215-year sojourn but it is not enough years for a 430-year\\n    sojourn.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Because of this the 215-year people conclude that when Moses said Israel\\'s\\n    sojourn was 430-years (Exodus 12:40), he was referring to the entire time\\n    from Abraham\\'s arrival in Canaan until the Exodus. Scripture reports that\\n    Abraham, Isaac and Jacob lived in Canaan 215-years before the move to\\n    Egypt. The remaining 215-years would be the years that are left for\\n    Israel\\'s sojourn in Egypt. Thus, they say, Israel sojourned in Egypt 215,\\n    not 430-years.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    But that interpretation conflicts with the very words of God, Stephen and\\n    Paul as well as those of Moses, all of whom uphold the 430-year number for\\n    the years Israel was in Egypt. In effect this approach jumps from the\\n    frying pan-trying to escape the difficulty of Exodus 6 and Numbers 26-into\\n    the fire-doing violence to the words of God, Moses, Stephen and Paul. If\\n    the Exodus and Numbers passages will only support a 215-year sojourn while\\n    the four witnesses testify to a 430-year sojourn, the Bible apparently is\\n    contradicting itself and inerrancy is compromised. Since inerrancy assures\\n    that Scripture does not contradict itself, how is this dilemma resolved?\\n    The answer is found in the hidden beauty of Hebrew genealogies.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h4 id=\"the-hidden-beauty-of-hebrew-genealogies\">The Hidden Beauty of Hebrew Genealogies</h4>\\n<p>\\n    Because Biblical Hebrew relational terms were used in both narrow and broad\\n    senses, \"father\" could mean father, grandfather or ancestor. The same was\\n    true of son, beget, and other common kinship terms. In Hebrew genealogies\\n    both the narrow and broad senses of these family relationships were\\n    employed. In the Levi-Aaron genealogy the maximum possible consecutive\\n    years of the named four living in Egypt (352) falls far short of 430-years\\n    in Egypt. To get 430-years more generations are needed. Since they are not\\n    stated, <strong>this genealogy is abbreviated.</strong> Generations are\\n    omitted. The following table shows the impossibility of four generations\\n    spanning 430-years on the left and therefore what missing generations might\\n    look like on the right.\\n</p>\\n<div

Amram had a son who had a son and somewhere down\\n    the line Aaron, Moses and Miriam were born. To say Aaron was the son of\\n    Amram when many generations came in between is no different than Matthew\\n    1:1 saying Jesus Christ was the son of David when many generations came in\\n    between. This was a common and accepted way for ancient Hebrews to state\\n    their genealogical relationships.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong></strong>\\n</p>\\n<h4 id=\"conclusion-to-the-debate\">Conclusion to the 215/430 Debate</h4>\\n\\n<p>\\n    This chapter began by pointing out that a 215-year Egyptian sojourn is not\\n    stated in Scripture but is primarily a deduction based on the Levi-Aaron\\n    genealogy recorded in Exodus 6 and Numbers 26. The few generations stated\\n    in those two passages do not permit a 430-year sojourn. While those\\n    passages appear to be reporting that a grandson of Levi married a daughter\\n    of Levi and they became the immediate parents of Miriam, Aaron and Moses,\\n    that is the overview but there is more to the story. Rather Amram and\\n    Jochebed had these children through intermediate generations. Omitting\\n    generations between Amram and Aaron was not a scribal error; it was a way\\n    to state genealogies efficiently.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h4 id=\"nature-of-the-levi-aaron-abbreviation\">Nature of the Levi-Aaron Abbreviation</h4>\\n<p>\\n    The Jewish people all descended from a common ancestor. The God of creation\\n    told that ancestor, Abraham, that He would make of him a great nation. His\\n    grandson, Jacob, had twelve sons. Each formed a unit of the promised nation\\n    called a tribe. The sons and sometimes further descendants of these tribal\\n    fathers formed units within each tribe with various designations. As\\n    populations increased in succeeding generations that division was further\\n    broken down into a third level. It also had various names. Knowing a\\n    person\\'s identity with these three levels provided a powerful picture of\\n    the person. It showed where he belonged in the nation.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    God said all booty from the battle of Jericho was under a ban. A soldier\\n    violated the ban. In judgment God caused the Israelites to lose their next\\n    battle. When the leaders cried out to God, He said to find the guilty\\n    soldier and execute him. To find him they were to bring each tribe before\\n    the LORD. Scripture continues: \"And the tribe that the LORD takes by lot\\n    shall come near by clans. And the clan that the LORD takes shall come near\\n    by households. And the household that the LORD takes shall come near man by\\n    man\" Joshua 7:14. Here is an instance where God Himself spoke of those\\n    three levels of organization of the nation-He called them tribe, clan and\\n    household (ESV). While Scripture uses various designations for them in\\n    other places, here God used specific designations for them. This book will\\n    follow His example and refer to that first level as tribe, to the second\\n    level as clan and to the third level as household.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Without question Levi, the third son of Jacob, formed a tribe. Numbers 26\\n    speaks of the second census of Israel. It was conducted just before\\n    entering Canaan. The tribe of Levi was dedicated to the spiritual life of\\n    Israel so its population was not counted with the other tribes that became\\n    the army of Israel. In the census each of the twelve ordinary tribes are\\n    individually named. In doing so Scripture speaks of each son as follows:\\n    \"Reuben, the firstborn of Israel, the sons of Reuben: of\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Hanoch, the clans of the Hanochites&#8230;.\" Numbers 26:5. The chapter\\n    lists each of the twelve tribes with the same sons as found in the list\\n    that went to Egypt 470 years earlier. Then it speaks of the tribe of Levi\\n    in the same way: \"This was the list of the Levites according to their\\n    clans: of Gershon, the clan of the Gershonites; of Kohath, the clan of the\\n    Kohathites; of Merari, the clan of the Merarites\" (Numbers 26:58). Next it\\n    says that Kohath was the father of Amram. So, the organization of Israel\\n    adds to the view that these names are consecutive: Levi-Kohath-Amram.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    When Moses recorded the Levi-Aaron list, he first cited the tribe that\\n    Aaron belonged to (Levi), then the clan (Kohath) and finally the household\\n    (Amram). He knew who Aaron\\'s father, grandfather and great grandfather\\n    were. But they were unknown and unimportant to the nation at large. To list\\n    them would have been tedious, clumsy and unnecessary. But knowing the three\\n    levels of Aaron\\'s ancestry was very important. This pedigree showed that\\n    both Aaron and his younger brother Moses were part of the very foundation\\n    of the nation. While God called Moses and authenticated him with signs,\\n    ancestors that laid the foundation of the Hebrew people added respect and\\n    legitimacy to him as God\\'s chosen leader. This understanding of purpose\\n    explains why Levi\\'s list is so short. Moses omitted all the generations\\n    between Amram and Aaron. The existence of one undeniably abbreviated Hebrew\\n    genealogy in Scripture sets a precedent. If one genealogy was abbreviated,\\n    others could be as well. <strong></strong>\\n</p>\\n\\n<h4 id=\"implications-for-shems-genealogy\">Implications for Shem\\'s Genealogy </h4>\\n<p>\\n    While the abbreviation of most Hebrew genealogies would have no significant\\n    effect on the date of the Flood, an abbreviation in Shem\\'s genealogy would.\\n    Then, adding those numbers would give an incorrect date. But Shem\\'s\\n    genealogy contains a feature that makes it different from the Levi-Aaron\\n    list. It not only identifies each father\\'s son but gives the year when that\\n    son was born, saying two years after the Flood a son by the name of\\n    Arpachshad was born to Shem (Genesis 11:10). It continues by saying that\\n    when Arpachshad had lived 35 years, he fathered Shelah (Genesis 11:12).\\n    Scripture states the age of each succeeding father when his heir was born.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    This feature appears to assure that Shem\\'s list is complete-no ifs, ands or\\n    buts. Nevertheless, in view of the fact that most inerrancy scholars are\\n    certain the Ussher date is too late, is there anything in Scripture to\\n    suggest the years of any of the fathers might be interpreted differently?\\n    Does Scripture anywhere provide information or give an example that would\\n    answer this difficulty? In fact it does. The very iron-clad genealogy of\\n    Levi provides a completely satisfactory solution to the Shem issue in the\\n    following way.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    What is overlooked is that the Levi-Aaron list also gives factual details\\n    about the father before the confirmed omission. While some of that\\n    information could be true of Aaron\\'s immediate parents, other factual\\n    details make it impossible for Amram to be the immediate father of Aaron.\\n    If so, to whom does that factual information apply? It must be true of the\\n    unnamed immediate son of Amram and only in a broad sense is it true of any\\n    further omitted generations and of Aaron. The following paragraphs identify\\n    an amazing list of factual details about the generation in question.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The father at issue is the third name in the Levi-Kohath-Amram-Aaron\\n    genealogy, Amram. The following facts are stated in Scripture about him:\\n    first, Amram is the first of four named sons born to Kohath (Exodus 6:18).\\n    Remember, Kohath was alive when Jacob joined Joseph to begin the sojourn in\\n    Egypt. Second, Amram took a wife (Exodus 6:20). Third, her name was\\n    Jochebed (Exodus 6:20, Numbers 26:59). Fourth, she was the daughter of Levi\\n    (Numbers 26:59); fifth, she was the sister of Amram\\'s father (Exodus 6:20)\\n    and, sixth, she was born in Egypt (Numbers 26:59). In other words this\\n    daughter of Levi was not born in Canaan like Levi\\'s three sons-Gershon,\\n    Kohath and Merari (Genesis 46:11). Rather, she was born after the move,\\n    making her younger than her three brothers.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Seventh, since Amram was not listed among those sons of Jacob that moved to\\n    Egypt (Genesis 46:11), he, too, was born after the move, that is, he too\\n    was born in Egypt. If Scripture hadn\\'t included the information about\\n    Jochebed being born in Egypt, it might have left the impression that Amram\\n    married someone old enough to be his mother. Eighth, in addition to Aaron,\\n    Moses was also born to Amram (Exodus 6:20). Ninth, in addition to Aaron and\\n    Moses, Miriam was also born to Amram and Jochebed (Numbers 26:59). Indeed,\\n    depending on what is counted, up to nine specific facts are revealed in\\n    Scripture about the third generation male in the Levi-Aaron list of Exodus\\n    6:18-22 and Numbers 26:58-59.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Because Hebrews commonly named descendants after famous ancestors, some of\\n    these facts could apply to the parents of Aaron. But the fact that both\\n    Amram and Jochebed were born at the beginning of the 430-year sojourn in\\n    Egypt while Aaron was born near the end of that 430-year period separates\\n    the third and fourth names in the Levi list by some 300 years. Three\\n    hundred years makes it impossible for Aaron to be the immediate son of\\n    Amram. Therefore, those nine entirely true factual details about Amram\\n    apply to his unnamed son and only by the Hebrew custom of viewing all\\n    descendants as the son of the father do they apply to Aaron.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Some might suggest that numbers are more factual than other information,\\n    that in the statement \"When Eber had lived 34 years, he fathered Peleg\"\\n    (Genesis 11:16), the number \"34\" is an absolute fact and cannot be viewed\\n    in any other way. We agree. The number \"34\" is an absolute fact. It cannot\\n    be viewed in any other way. It is just like the absolute fact of Jochebed\\n    being born in Egypt. Thus, the entire list of nine facts about Amram cannot\\n    be viewed in any other way. The insight lacking through all church history\\n    was that Scripture used Hebrew family relational terms in both a narrow\\n    sense and a broad sense. The question here is whether Eber fathering Peleg\\n    is used in a narrow sense or broad sense. If the writer used it in the\\n    broad sense, generations are omitted between Eber and Peleg.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The Levi-Aaron list becomes the biblical pattern for understanding details\\n    of a father before a suspected omission. The details apply to the first\\n    unnamed son while the name that appears is used in the broad sense of a son\\n    further down the line. For beyond doubt names are missing between Amram and\\n    Aaron because Aaron came some 300 years after Amram. To remove that\\n    impossible timespan previous generations argued fiercely for a 215-year\\n    sojourn in Egypt. Since some creationists still hold that view, the entire\\n    next chapter explains the impossibility of that position.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    When the biblical pattern is applied to Shem\\'s list, if there are one or\\n    more omissions, the age of the father when his heir was born refers\\n    specifically to the first unnamed generation. But a high degree of\\n    certainty is needed to suspect names are omitted from any list. Shem\\'s list\\n    gives two. First is the impossibly late Flood date it produces apart from\\n    omitted names. But chapter seven gives an overwhelming second reason. While\\n    longevity decreased between two and eight years per generation after the\\n    Flood, the decrease between Eber and Peleg is 225 years or 61% of the\\n    entire decrease from the Flood until human longevity stabilized at 70 years\\n    for a full lifetime. The Eber-Peleg record is another Amram-Aaron case.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h4 id=\"viewing-shems-list-as-a-chrono-genealogy\">Viewing Shem\\'s List as a Chrono-Genealogy</h4>\\n<p>\\n    Those holding that Shem\\'s list is complete add the ages of the fathers when\\n    their sons were fathered and declare that those years make it possible to\\n    determine the date of the Flood. They call that type of genealogy a\\n    chrono-genealogy. They then reason that even if there are omitted<strong><u>names</u></strong> between Eber and\\n    Peleg the<strong><u>number</u></strong> 34 ties Peleg to a <strong><u>chronology</u></strong> and therefore the\\n    total time between\\n    Eber and Peleg cannot exceed 34 years. This argument is also called the\\n    \"bookends\" argument.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Yet, how is a number different from any other category of words that\\n    express an absolutely true detail, such as the detail that Jochebed was the\\n    sister of Amram\\'s father who lived at the beginning of the 430-year sojourn\\n    in Egypt? Clearly there is no difference. Numbers are no different from\\n    other precise words expressing a fact. Words that express true facts are\\n    true whether they are numbers or not. The bookend argument makes a\\n    superficial distinction between numbers and other words and interjects a\\n    false element into the time of the Flood debate.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    While that argument is clever, it is incorrect and must be recognized as an\\n    invention of man to support a particular interpretation of how to treat\\n    those numbers. It is not stated by Scripture and violates how Scripture\\n    itself treats such details in Levi\\'s genealogy. Further it is not verified\\n    by Moses in as much as he did not add up those numbers in Shem\\'s list. Most\\n    important of all this argument could not be why God included those numbers\\n    because they give the wrong answer for the time of the Flood.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Those who hold this view reason: \"Why else would Eber\\'s age be given when\\n    he fathered Peleg other than to tell when the Flood happened?\" In response\\n    Andrew E. Steinmann answered this question (applying it to Genesis 5 as\\n    well as Genesis 11 since the two instances of this format actually provide\\n    a stronger case against viewing them as having a chronological purpose):\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>\\n        This [chrono-genealogical argument] assumes that the information was\\n        included for chronological purposes and then argues that the\\n        genealogies must therefore be useful for chronological calculations.

Moses wrote around 1400 BC when the\\n    lifespan of man was 70. Saying that people once lived to the age of 900\\n    would be met with skepticism. Moses knew about the well-known fictitious\\n    stories of exceptionally long lifespans in the past. The Sumerian King List\\n    included one king who was said to have reigned 43,200 years. Moses\\' numbers\\n    had to be separated from such exaggerations. By giving the years before the\\n    birth of the heir, the years after and the total years of each father in\\n    Genesis 5, God through Moses did all He could to assure His readers those\\n    people actually lived that long. Furthermore, those numbers provide the\\n    very patterns that have aided us in building our explanations concerning\\n    man\\'s decreasing longevity which is the key argument for the missing 35-55\\n    generations between Eber and Peleg.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    In the Abstract of Steinmann\\'s 2018 article, he noted a recent spate of\\n    articles arguing that the genealogies of Genesis 5 and 11 were complete,\\n    skipping no generations. In checking his observation this author found that\\n    three of the articles in a single issue of a popular monthly\\n    age-of-the-earth magazine mentioned the too-recent year number. Steinmann\\n    summarized his article as follows: \" <strong>The major arguments they use are defective and falsifiable</strong>\\n    .\"<a href=\"\" name=\"_ftnref3\" title=\"\"><sup><sup>[3]</sup></sup></a> His\\n    version is 18 pages. But he only scratches the surface. Somewhere a book\\n    must spell it all out in detail. Hopefully by showing the nature and\\n    function of ancient Hebrew genealogies <em>Hidden Beauty</em> will open\\n    people\\'s eyes to the frequent abbreviating of biblical genealogies.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h4 id=\"the-abbreviation-of-shems-genealogy-in-retrospect\">The Abbreviation of Shem\\'s Genealogy in Retrospect</h4>\\n<p>\\n    Human longevity declined gradually from the first fathers born after the\\n    Flood until the days of Moses, from average full lifespans of 450 years to\\n    average full lifespans of 70 years. This is an average full lifespan\\n    decline of 380 years. Scripture gives abundant details to track this\\n    decline. Shelah who represents the second generation born after the Flood\\n    (433-year lifespan), lived five fewer years than his father (438-year\\n    lifespan) who was born two years after the Flood. Over the next two\\n    millennia the rate of decline was sometimes faster and sometimes slower but\\n    longevity stopped declining in Moses\\' day when he wrote that a full\\n    lifetime was 70 years. To this day 70 years generally stands as a full\\n    lifespan. But there was one exception during the gradual decline of those\\n    born after the Flood, a sudden one-time drop of 225 years. This one\\n    instance is between Eber and Peleg. Eber lived 464 years while Peleg, the\\n    next named person, lived 239 years, a decline of 225 years or 61%\\n    (225/369=61%) of the total decline of human longevity after the Flood. This\\n    eye-popping decline was either produced by another catastrophe as great as\\n    the Flood or it is another Amram-Aaron case. There is no evidence for such\\n    a catastrophe 100 years after the Flood. Thus, it is another Amram-Aaron\\n    case.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The Amram-Aaron sequence leaves out an estimated 8-12 generations. The\\n    Eber-Peleg sequence leaves out as many as 55 generations. With new\\n    generations starting each 30-34 years when people lived 200-450 years, this\\n    represents up to 1900 more years of human history after the Flood than\\n    previously thought (and pushes the first man back accordingly). Since God\\n    is not more specific, we dare not violate this ambiguity. These few\\n    additional years make no difference at all in the creation-evolution\\n    controversy, but they make a world of difference in honoring Scripture\\n    because they treat both the words and numbers of Scripture as inerrant.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Once we understand what the Bible literally says, we are free to examine\\n    the findings of secular disciplines; for, sooner or later when the secular\\n    world has all the facts, it will confirm God\\'s record. So, have such\\n    findings caught up with the revelation of Scripture? The Flood changed the\\n    face of the earth up to ten miles down so it obliterated the physical\\n    evidence of human existence that would speak to the condensing of the\\n    Genesis 5 list. However, the Genesis 11 list involves the history of man\\n    after the Flood. To some extent evidence for that history still exists and\\n    is constantly being discovered through such disciplines as studies of\\n    Hebrew and related languages, textual studies, archaeology and ancient Near\\n    East history.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Adding the time represented in the missing generations between Eber and\\n    Peleg to the additional 215-years in Egypt provides enough time to\\n    encompass all well-established human history as found in written records\\n    since the Flood. Thus, getting the genealogies of Scripture right provides\\n    harmony between the words and numbers of Scripture and removes a huge\\n    stumbling block between biblical creationists and other Evangelical\\n    scholars. (See chapter seven for a full development of the abbreviation of\\n    Shem\\'s genealogy.)\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The next chapter examines the words of four witnesses to a 430-year sojourn\\n    in Egypt. In Archbishop Ussher\\'s day the text of Exodus 12:40 was\\n    deficient; so, for centuries believers held the 215-year view believing\\n    they were standing on Scripture. Over the next two centuries the text was\\n    clarified. Now eminent Hebrew scholars are unanimous-Moses clearly says the\\n    Egyptian sojourn lasted 430-years. But all along the words of God Himself\\n    to Abraham in Genesis 15:13 pointed to a 430-year sojourn in Egypt and\\n    excluded a 215-year sojourn.\\n</p>\\n\\n<div>\\n    <br clear=\"all\" />\\n    <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\" />\\n    <div id=\"ftn1\">\\n        <p>\\n            <a href=\"\" name=\"_ftn1\" title=\"\">[1]</a>\\n            http://www.bible-researcher.com/chicago1.html\\n        </p>\\n    </div>\\n    <div id=\"ftn2\">\\n        <p>\\n            <a href=\"\" name=\"_ftn2\" title=\"\">[2]</a>\\n            Andrew E.

Clearly,\\n        the Hebrews abbreviated their genealogies. But this could only be true\\n        if Israel sojourned in Egypt 430-years and the traditional view was\\n        215, not 430-years. God, Moses, Stephen and Paul speak to the issue.\\n        Beyond doubt they testify to a 430-Year Egyptian sojourn. Consequently,\\n        this chapter must examine the testimony of these four in considerable\\n        detail because the past confusion is still bothersome. In the process\\n        it will become apparent why the 215-year option was preferred but is\\n        now obviously incorrect.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n        God Himself in Genesis 15 is the first witness. He spoke of 400 years\\n        of affliction but did not name the country where the affliction would\\n        occur. However, He did say Israel would come out of that country in the\\n        4<sup>th</sup> generation. That sounded more like 215-years than 430 to\\n        the traditionalists. The second witness, Moses, wrote about 430-years\\n        but his words could be understood as a total of 430-years between\\n        Canaan and Egypt until a corruption in the text was corrected in modern\\n        times. The third witness, Stephen, quoted God\\'s 400 years so his words\\n        fall in the same camp as God\\'s. The final witness, Paul, quoted Moses\\'\\n        430-years but his words are usually understood to be the total time in\\n        Canaan and Egypt so he was viewed as supporting 215-years.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n        Josephus, the church fathers, Ussher, the Reformers and the King James\\n        translators all held the 215-year view, but looking back, they were the\\n        victims of historical inaccuracies. Many in the inerrancy camp are\\n        still in this fog. The following will give better material for an\\n        informed view.\\n    </p>\\n    <h3 id=\"the-witness-of-god\">\\n        A. The Witness of God-Genesis 15:12-16\\n    </h3>\\n    <p>\\n        When Abraham was a young man, God was searching for a vessel to greatly\\n        further His work among mankind and begin a line of men who would know\\n        Him. Their descendants would eventually become a nation that declared\\n        His ways and produced both the Bible and the Messiah. The man God\\n        called was Abraham. In the beginning Abraham did not know God. He and\\n        his relatives were idol worshippers. They lived in one of the most\\n        culturally advanced cities on planet earth, but it had forsaken the\\n        knowledge of God.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n        Even yet, God appeared to him and told him to separate from his\\n        remarkable city, his many relatives, even from his father\\'s house and\\n        follow God to an undisclosed location. If he met those four conditions,\\n        God promised that his name would be great, that he would become a great\\n        nation and that in him all the earth would be blessed. Heady stuff!\\n        Eventually Abraham would fully obey so that God could fulfill His\\n        promises.\\n    </p>\\n    <h4 id=\"need-for-a-covenant\">\\n        Need for a Covenant\\n    </h4>\\n    <p>\\n        God cannot lie because His word proceeds from His nature-perfect\\n        righteousness. All His promises to Abraham were real and would happen.\\n        However the road to becoming a great nation would be incredibly\\n        difficult and take many generations. His descendants would eventually\\n        be reduced to slavery in another land. While the promises were certain,\\n        hardships along the way might lead to despair so God reassured Abraham\\n        as well as his son Isaac and his grandson Jacob with visitation after\\n        visitation, repeating and even expanding the promises.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n        The visitation in which God disclosed the frightening news that the\\n        path involved 400 years of affliction stood above all others. In\\n        Genesis 15 God made a blood covenant, swearing by Himself alone that no\\n        matter what, He would unconditionally do what He had promised. In the\\n        vision God was saying, \"May I be like the slain animals of the covenant\\n        if I do not keep my word to you.\" There was nothing Abraham or his\\n        descendants could do to produce the results of the covenant except obey\\n        God. Fulfilling the promises would be the supernatural work of God.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n        This covenant was given about ten years after Abraham followed God to\\n        the Promised Land. Abraham and his descendants needed to have clearly\\n        in their minds that a time of fearful terror lay ahead. This horrible\\n        period would happen in another land. God would be with them and their\\n        oppression would finally end with them suddenly becoming a great and\\n        wealthy nation. As for Abraham, he would die in peace before this\\n        period of servitude began.\\n    </p>\\n    <h4 id=\"setting-for-the-covenant\">\\n        Setting for the Covenant-Genesis 15:1-11\\n    </h4>\\n    <p>\\n        Genesis 15 opens with Abraham gripped in fear. The preceding fall he\\n        had rescued Lot from the invasion of four powerful Mesopotamian armies\\n        and slaughtered its soldiers. Now it was the next spring, the time when\\n        armies went on the march. Abraham was scaring himself to death as he\\n        envisioned the certain revenge for which he was no match. In addition\\n        he had turned his back on the spoils of his victory and was being stung\\n        with criticism for such a foolish act. These thoughts left him in deep\\n        distress.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n        Then God\\'s word came to Abraham in a vision, saying \"Fear not, Abram. I\\n        am your shield; your reward shall be very great\" (Genesis 15:1). God\\n        was saying that the mightiest army in the world could not harm him\\n        because the God of creation would be his defense. In addition, God\\n        would give him a far greater reward than the spoils of Sodom he\\n        refused.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n        Abraham had other troubling thoughts. How could he become a nation when\\n        he didn\\'t even have a son? God replied that he would have a son and his\\n        descendants would be like the stars-more numerous than he could number.\\n        Abraham asked how he could be sure this would happen. God told Abraham\\n        to cut in half a heifer, a goat and a ram and lay the halves on either\\n        side of a path. After foretelling key events of the next 700 years God\\n        alone passed between the bloody pieces of the animals thereby signing\\n        the covenant and making Him alone responsible for its fulfillment.\\n    </p>\\n    <h4 id=\"terrifying-times-ahead\">\\n        Terrifying Times Ahead - Genesis 15:12-16\\n    </h4>\\n    <p>\\n        About dusk, in his vision Abraham fell asleep. Then God made him sense\\n        the horrors his descendants would experience during a future time of\\n        servitude. That nightmare is described in Genesis 15:12 while its\\n        meaning is explained in the next four verses. Abraham\\'s offspring would\\n        be aliens in a foreign country. There they would suffer affliction 400\\n        years. But they would not be destroyed. Instead they would return to\\n        this Promised Land in great numbers and with great wealth. They could\\n        not take possession of the land yet because others were still entitled\\n        to it. But the land was Abraham\\'s and his descendants by right of\\n        divine promise. As for Abraham, this dark period would not touch him.\\n        He would die in peace. Is this indeed what these verses are saying or\\n        is the traditional explanation to be preferred?\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n        <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>\\n        <strong>\\n            As the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell on Abram. And behold,\\n            dreadful and great darkness fell upon him. <sup>13</sup>Then the\\n            LORD said to Abram, \"Know for certain that your offspring will be\\n            sojourners in a land that is not theirs and will be servants there,\\n            and they will be afflicted for four hundred years.\" Genesis\\n            15:12-13.\\n        </strong>\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n        Grouping these two verses together shows the terrifying sense of danger\\n        that came over Abraham and the divine explanation for it. The\\n        traditional viewpoint generally ignores the dread of verse 12 and\\n        begins with God\\'s words in verse 13. But without acknowledging the\\n        overwhelming darkness, any explanation of verse 13 will overlook its\\n        intent. The table below examines God\\'s explanation for the cause of\\n        Abraham\\'s fear. It contains six elements (left column) together with a\\n        reasonable explanation of each element.

They\\n    feel four generations demand a 215-year Egyptian sojourn, so they have no\\n    other choice than to wrench some of God\\'s clear statements in verse 13 as\\n    well as verses 14 and 15. Besides all this confusion in attempting a\\n    consistent interpretation, various 215-year supporters give interpretations\\n    of verses 13-16 that even disagree with each other. Clearly their\\n    explanation of Genesis 15:12-16 is inconsistent and must be rejected.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    But there is more. God continues&#8230;\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <sup>14</sup>\\n    <strong>\\n        But I will bring judgment on the nation that they serve, and afterward\\n        they shall come out with great possessions. <sup>15</sup>As for you,\\n        you shall go to your fathers in peace; you shall be buried in a good\\n        old age. <sup>16</sup>And they shall come back here in the fourth\\n        generation, for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet complete.\\n        Genesis 15:14-16.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The two assertions of verse fourteen are momentous in their own right. God\\n    would judge the nation that enslaved His people and His people would come\\n    forth from that nation with \"great possessions.\" Over 430-years Jacob\\'s\\n    small band multiplied to a population of several million. Then, when God\\n    ordered the oppressing nation to free His people which it refused to do, He\\n    sent ten devastating plagues of judgment. With that, the oppressors urged\\n    His people to leave before they all perished and sent them away with\\n    valuable gifts. A few days later, the nation had a change of heart and sent\\n    its chariot army to bring the Hebrews back. God thwarted this effort by\\n    destroying their military force in the waters of the Red Sea.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    All this happened in the land of Egypt. Egypt was not promised to the\\n    Hebrews but was the land in which they would become servants, the land\\n    where they would be afflicted four hundred years. Egypt was the nation God\\n    would judge and its wealth would enrich His people.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    God spends all of verse 15 with words of assurance to Abraham-he would not\\n    endure the grueling slavery destined for his descendants. While it might be\\n    possible to argue that verse 13 implies the affliction would touch Abraham\\n    as well, God clearly rules out Abraham\\'s participation in this sojourn of\\n    servitude with these key phrases: \"As for you,\" \"go to your fathers in\\n    peace,\" and \"buried in a good old age.\" In the light of these words, it is\\n    hard to understand how the traditional view can insist that Abraham shared\\n    in the affliction of verse thirteen.\\n</p>\\n<h4 id=\"three-momentous-assertions-by-jehovah\">\\n    Three momentous assertions by Jehovah\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>\\n        And they shall come back here in the fourth generation, for the\\n        iniquity of the Amorites is not yet complete. Genesis 15:16.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    1. \"And they shall come back here.\" Hundreds of years of affliction, some\\n    involving grinding slavery would not annihilate Abraham\\'s descendants. They\\n    would be given the Promised Land just as Jehovah had covenanted.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    2. \"In the fourth generation.\" God did not give a vague promise of a return\\n    \"someday.\" This specific time marker would constantly provide hope during\\n    the period of affliction.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    3. \"For the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet complete.\" Amorites\\n    occupied the land God promised Abraham. While God is longsuffering, there\\n    is a point where a people group has advanced so deeply into sin that hardly\\n    anyone in it can get come to know Him. Thus, He must remove that entire\\n    people group. God saw the direction and result of their iniquity. It was\\n    headed towards the place where justice would obligate Him to remove them.\\n    Once their iniquity was complete they surrendered their right to the land\\n    and God was free to give it to others. God would remove the populous\\n    city-state of Sodom just years later for this very reason; there weren\\'t\\n    even ten righteous in it. So verse 16 provided another reason for the\\n    lengthy stay in Egypt and thus the need for patience until the right time\\n    arrived.\\n</p>\\n<h4 id=\"fourth-generation-promise\">\\n    Genesis 15:16-Fourth Generation Promise\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\n    The statements about returning to Canaan and the Amorites\\' iniquity are\\n    clear and understandable but what did God mean by His statement that they\\n    would return in the fourth generation? It means, says the majority view,\\n    the fourth generation of Israelites in Egypt would return to Canaan. They\\n    claim this proves a 215-year Egyptian sojourn and eliminates a 430-year\\n    Egyptian sojourn, since four generations could reach 215-years, but not\\n    430-years. They point to Exodus six which names four generations ending\\n    with Moses and Aaron who participated in the Exodus (passage cited below).\\n    Exodus six records that Levi had a son named Kohath. Kohath had a son named\\n    Amram and Amram had two sons, Moses and Aaron. The four generations were\\n    Levi, Kohath, Amram and Aaron. While this explanation requires strained\\n    explanations for a dozen other details in Genesis 15:12-16 it is the only\\n    way, they say.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    But this idea doesn\\'t work because Aaron had four grown sons at the time of\\n    the Exodus. If Levi-Kohath-Amram-Aaron were the right four generations, God\\n    did not keep His promise. To make matters worse Exodus six also names\\n    Aaron\\'s grandson, Phinehas, who possibly was born in Egypt. Maybe Levi\\'s\\n    line came out in the sixth generation. Others have recognized this problem\\n    and attempted to identify four other generations, but none work. The fact\\n    is, the four generations can\\'t be found if \"fourth generation\" is\\n    interpreted as four consecutive father-son generations. The critical verses\\n    are found in Exodus 6:16, 18, 20, 23 and 25:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <sup>16</sup>\\n    <strong>\\n        These are the names of the sons of <u>Levi</u> according to their\\n        generations: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari, the years of the life of Levi\\n        being 137 years. <sup>18</sup>The sons of <u>Kohath</u>: Amram, Izhar,\\nHebron, and Uzziel, the years of the life of Kohath being 133 years.        <sup>20</sup><u>Amram</u> took as his wife Jockebed his father\\'s\\n        sister, and she bore him <u>Aaron</u> and Moses, the years of the life\\n        of Amram being 137 years. <sup>23</sup>Aaron took as his wife Elisheba,\\nthe daughter of Amminadab and the sister of Nahshon, and she bore him        <u>Nadab, Abihu</u>, <u>Eleazar, and Ithamar</u>. <sup>25</sup>Eleazar,\\n        Aaron\\'s son, took as his wife one of the daughters of Putiel, and she\\n        bore him <u>Phinehas</u>. (Emphasis ours.)\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    \"Coming out in the fourth generation\" also raises the question, \"How many\\n    years elapsed from the start of one generation to the start of the next?\\n    While many years elapsed in the generations of Terah, Abraham, Isaac and\\n    Jacob, beginning with Jacob\\'s sons new generations generally started every\\n    20 to 30 years. At that rate four generations would place the deliverance\\n    in 80 to 120 years (20x4=80; 30x4=120). Such a time frame even falls short\\n    of 215-years in Egypt. Further, God does not say four special generations\\n    but simply four generations. Everyone could count the generations in his\\n    family and expect deliverance when the number reached four.\\n</p>\\n<h4 id=\"generations-as-lifetimes\">\\n    \"Generations\" as \"Lifetimes\"\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\n    If a way could be found to harmonize the \"either/or\" verses, it would be a\\n    \"both/and\" victory for inerrancy. All the verses and each statement of each\\n    verse could be embraced without qualification, without diminishing, without\\n    violating inerrancy. We suggest that way is in a full understanding of the\\n    Hebrew concept of genealogies. It is much broader than in other cultures.\\n    Here the generations would be lifetimes-Israel would come out in four\\n    lifetimes, or in the fourth lifetime. Add up four known lifetimes and\\n    before the end of the fourth, Israel would come out of Egypt.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Moses wrote these words. He must have puzzled over what God had told\\n    Abraham 600 years before. He doesn\\'t identify four successive generations\\n    (the 215-year interpretation) but he does provide the numbers to make the\\n    idea of \"lifetimes\" work. He lists 40 men in the genealogies of Exodus six\\n    but amazingly he only records the ages of three: Levi-137 years (6:16);\\n    Kohath-133 years (6:18) and Amram-137 years (6:20). Their ages added\\n    together total 407 years. In the next chapter Moses wrote, \"Now Moses was\\n    eighty years old and Aaron eighty-three years old when they spoke to\\n    Pharaoh\" (Exodus 7:7). Those confrontations produced the Exodus. Adding\\n    those 83 years to the 407 years gives a total of 490 years, which more than\\n    covers a 430-year Egyptian sojourn (137+133+137+83=490). So a perfectly\\n    satisfactory interpretation is that in the total of four lifetimes or in\\n    the fourth lifetime Israel would come out.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    This interpretation allows each of the dozen details in Genesis 15:12-16 to\\n    be taken at face value, in their normal meaning. It completely upholds the\\n    principle of inerrancy. God had promised the affliction would end at a\\n    certain time and that the outcome would be marvelous. Under this\\n    interpretation the end of Israel\\'s servitude in Egypt would come in just\\n    four lifetimes.\\n</p>\\n<h4 id=\"accepting-the-witness-of-god\">\\n    Accepting the Witness of God\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\n    God Himself is the first speaker in Scripture to address the years of\\n    sojourn in Egypt. He said Abraham\\'s descendants would be afflicted in a\\n    land that was not theirs. Nearly all acknowledge this to be referring to\\n    Egypt. He said affliction in that land would continue for 400 years. Since\\n    400 years is clearly more than 215-years, God\\'s statement eliminates the\\n    traditional 215-year view. While the 215-year folks quickly fall back to\\n    Moses statement about Israel\\'s stay in Egypt in Exodus 12:40, we will show\\n    next that Moses statement does not support their view either.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Some see God\\'s 400 year statement and Moses 430-year statement as a\\n    conflict and then imply that it is impossible to know for sure what is\\n    being said. This conflict is resolved once one recalls that Moses was\\n    talking about Israel\\'s total time in Egypt which began with welcome, while\\n    God was speaking about the portion of time in Egypt after the welcome wore\\n    off and was characterized by affliction. The number 400 is also more\\n    general and could suggest that the time of affliction was introduced over a\\n    period of time. God\\'s statement agrees with Moses\\' 430-years statement but\\n    rejects a 215-year Egyptian stay.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    God is not only the first speaker in Scripture to address the issue but He\\n    is speaking specifically about the length of time in Egypt. Further, He is\\n    the most important speaker in all of Scripture. In just five words, the\\n    first five words of Scripture, \"In the beginning God created,\" He settled\\n    the creation/evolution issue. Certainly in five verses He could settle the\\n    215/430-year issue. As we shall soon see, the position of the traditional\\n    view only seems to worsen.\\n</p>\\n<h3 id=\"the-witness-of-moses\">\\n    B. The Witness of Moses-Exodus 12:40-41\\n</h3>\\n<p>\\n    So, how does Moses weigh in on the subject? After all, he was there. Under\\n    the LORD he led Israel out of Egypt. Maybe we have missed something, but\\n    his words seem clear. In Exodus 12:40-41 he states:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <sup>40</sup>\\n    <strong>\\nThe time that the people of Israel lived in Egypt was 430-years.        <sup>41</sup>At the end of 430-years, on that very day, all the hosts\\n        of the LORD went out from the land of Egypt.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The Hebrew text of verse forty was not always clear. In the days of Sir\\n    Isaac Newton, Archbishop James Ussher, and the translation of the King\\n    James Version there were long standing questions about the text. The\\n    Septuagint gave the translation \"lived in Egypt and Canaan.\" Josephus took\\n    that view. As a result the nearly universal view of Christians 400 years\\n    ago was that the 430-year sojourn included both the years in Canaan and in\\n    Egypt. This is where the idea came from that 215 of the 430-year sojourn\\n    were spent in Canaan by Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Newton, Ussher and the\\n    King James translators were all products of their age and expressed the\\n    understanding of their day.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Over the next two centuries textual scholars worked to resolve the\\n    difficulties with the text. By the late 1800\\'s Robert Jamieson of the six\\n    volume Jamieson-Fausset-Brown commentary series could say that hardly any\\n    Hebrew scholar of eminence still accepted the corrupted text that allowed\\n    for understanding that the 430-years spanned the time Abraham and his\\ndescendants lived in the Promised Land and in Egypt.    <a href=\"#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\" title=\"\">[2]</a> Today even those few\\n    eminent Hebraists are history. Only the incorrect translation of 1611 and\\n    its successors remain to uphold the faulty interpretation. Those who still\\n    teach that Israel sojourned in Egypt just 215-years reject hundreds of\\n    years of work to determine the correct text. Today\\'s translations such as\\n    the ESV used in this book (Exodus 12:40 cited above) clearly state that\\n    Israel sojourned in Egypt 430-years.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Many have unwittingly clung to the incorrect view of Newton and Ussher\\'s\\n    day.

The church\\'s\\n    first martyr, Stephen, before being stoned, declared:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <sup>6</sup>\\n    <strong>\\n        And God spoke to this effect-that his [Abraham\\'s] offspring would be\\n        sojourners in a land belonging to others, who would enslave them and\\n        afflict them four hundred years. <sup>7</sup>\"But I will judge the\\n        nation that they serve,\" said God, \"and after that they shall come out\\n        and worship me in this place.\" Acts 7:6-7.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Stephen, \"a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit,\" (Acts 6:5) was\\n    citing God\\'s words to Abraham in Genesis 15:13-14. The common elements\\n    agree-the subject is Abraham\\'s descendants who would be living as aliens in\\n    a land God had not promised them; they would be enslaved and this\\n    affliction would last 400 years. Stephen unwittingly disclosed that in 2000\\n    years the belief of Jewry had not changed. After all that time they still\\n    understood God to be saying that the sojourn in Egypt would involve 400\\n    years of affliction.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    We have already seen how the traditional view feels compelled to find other\\n    explanations for God\\'s seemingly clear words to Abraham in Genesis 15. But\\n    reinterpreting Stephen\\'s words to mean something else would be very\\n    difficult. So, what does the traditional view do with Stephen\\'s testimony?\\n    They say Acts 7 is exactly what he said. Then they add that inerrancy only\\n    guarantees what a person says, not the accuracy of what is said. They say\\n    that this man whom Scripture says was full of the Holy Spirit misspoke. He\\n    was under pressure and/or was confused, so his words cannot necessarily be\\n    accepted as factual. On the contrary, Stephen must be added to the\\n    witnesses to a 430-year Egyptian sojourn. Now three consecutive witnesses\\n    in Scripture testify to the larger sojourn number.\\n</p>\\n<h3 id=\"the-witness-of-paul\">\\n    D. The Witness of Paul-Galatians 3:17\\n</h3>\\n<p>\\n    While Stephen is the New Testament witness to the 400-year number God gave\\n    to Abraham, the Apostle Paul is the New Testament witness to the 430-year\\n    number given by Moses:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>\\n        This is what I mean: the law, which came 430-years afterward, does not\\n        annul a covenant previously ratified by God, so as to make the promise\\n        void. Galatians 3:17.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Without question this is the traditional view\\'s favorite verse. \"Here is\\n    absolute proof\" they say, \"that the 430-years began when God first appeared\\n    to Abraham and ended with the Exodus.\" They say God made the promises of\\n    Genesis 12:1-3 to Abraham when he was living in Haran. He immediately\\n    obeyed God\\'s call and moved to Canaan. Then 430-years later the law was\\n    given at the time of the Exodus. Therefore the 430-years began when Abraham\\n    moved to Canaan and ended with the Exodus. The 430-years consisted of the\\n    years of sojourning in Canaan plus those in Egypt. Since Abraham, Isaac and\\n    Jacob sojourned in Canaan 215-years, the remaining 215-years was the time\\n    of sojourning in Egypt.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The traditional view cites Paul\\'s authority. Because he wrote more of the\\n    New Testament than any other writer and his books contain the heart of\\n    Christian doctrine, he outranks all other writers of Scripture. If there is\\n    some confusion between the Old Testament and the Apostle, one must prefer\\n    the Apostle. They suggest that possibly the Old Testament isn\\'t clear, but\\n    the Apostle is perfectly clear and he is the final authority. Thus the\\n    traditional view stands with the Apostle-the entire sojourn in Canaan and\\n    Egypt lasted 430-years, period, end of discussion.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    When this view leads the discussion, it doesn\\'t start with the very words\\n    of the LORD Himself in Genesis 15, but immediately starts with Galatians\\n    3:17 and then reinterprets the words of Stephen, Moses and Jehovah to agree\\n    with Paul. But which is better: to start with the primary sources, Jehovah\\n    and Moses, then work to the secondary sources in the New Testament, or\\n    start with one secondary source, work on the other secondary source and\\n    then rework the primary sources?\\n</p>\\n<h4 id=\"reconciling-paul-with-god-moses-and-stephen\">\\n    Reconciling Paul with God, Moses and Stephen\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\n    Nevertheless, every knowing Christian takes very seriously what the Apostle\\n    wrote. What, then, are we to do with Paul\\'s words? First we should observe\\n    that the subject of both God and of Moses was the number of years in Egypt;\\n    Stephen and Paul were addressing other subjects. Stephen\\'s point was that\\n    Israel\\'s leaders historically rejected God\\'s messengers. So he specifically\\n    quoted God\\'s words to Abraham as he reminded his hearers that God had\\n    raised up the nation to sovereignly accomplish His will even though His\\n    will was constantly resisted.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Paul, like Stephen, was not discussing how many years Israel sojourned in\\n    Egypt. He was showing that God\\'s grace preceded God\\'s Law. In his argument\\n    He cited a number every Jew would know-the 430-year number. It was repeated\\n    annually in the Passover celebration. Paul\\'s point was that the Law did not\\n    finally make a way for man to have a right relationship with God. God dealt\\n    with the forefathers of Israel in grace from the beginning, long before the\\n    law. That grace is seen in the promises and covenant God gave to Abraham,\\n    Isaac and Jacob. All this promise/covenant development happened 430-years\\n    before God gave Israel the Law.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    If there was no standing before God until the Law, the promises were\\n    meaningless and all the Jewish people who lived before the giving of the\\n    law missed out on a right relationship with God. The 430-year number was a\\n    powerful argument for grace rather than law. Yet the Galatian believers\\n    were being told that they needed to keep the Mosaic Law to enjoy God\\'s\\n    blessings. So, Paul argued that God established promises and a covenant\\n    with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Then 430-years later He gave the Law. In\\n    this way, Paul agrees with God, Moses and Stephen in supporting 430-years\\n    in Egypt.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    It should also be noted that since God\\'s and Moses\\' core subject was the\\n    time in Egypt while Stephen\\'s and Paul\\'s core subjects were other matters,\\n    God and Moses should be preferred over Stephen and Paul. But since\\n    Stephen\\'s words agree with God\\'s words, only Paul can be viewed to be at\\n    odds with the other three. Rather than working on the words of the other\\n    three witnesses, many of which are not subject to another interpretation,\\n    shouldn\\'t the first consideration be, \"Can Paul\\'s rather general words can\\n    be understood in another light?\"\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Proceeding on that basis-one insight would be Paul\\'s reference to covenant.\\n    God did not give Abraham a covenant when He called him. The covenant was\\n    not made until Abraham had been in the land about ten years-shortly before\\n    Abraham took Hagar to give Sarah a child. If Paul were talking about the\\n    time from the Covenant to the Law, he should have said 420 years, not\\n    430-years. On the other hand if the call came to Abraham when he was living\\n    in Ur, not when his father died in Haran, then the time from the call to\\n    the Law would have been greater than 430-years. (The next chapter shows\\n    that the call came in Ur, not Haran.)\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    But Paul is not speaking about Abraham\\'s call. He is speaking about the\\n    promises which foreshadow Jesus Christ and the salvation God would provide\\n    through Him. These promises were amplified over time to Abraham, then to\\n    his son Isaac and finally to his grandson Jacob. They were sworn to by God\\n    Himself in the covenant of Genesis 15.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Joseph invited his father to move to Egypt where there was food because\\n    five years of famine remained. Jacob accepted. He took his household as far\\n    as Beersheba in Southern Israel, but then he hesitated. Previously it had\\n    not been God\\'s will for him, his father or grandfather to leave the\\n    Promised Land. Jacob offered sacrifices. In a vision God gave him assurance\\n    to continue to Egypt.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>\\n    <strong>\\n        So Israel took his journey with all that he had and came to Beersheba,\\n        and offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac. <sup> 2</sup>And\\n        God spoke to Israel in visions of the night and said, \"Jacob, Jacob.\"\\n        And he said, \"Here I am.\" <sup>3</sup>Then he said, \"I am God, the God\\n        of your father. Do not be afraid to go down to Egypt, for there I will\\n        make you into a great nation. <sup>4</sup>I myself will go down with\\n        you to Egypt, and I will also bring you up again, and Joseph\\'s hand\\n        shall close your eyes.\" Genesis 46:1-4.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    In this passage God restates and amplifies the promises for the final time\\n    before the sojourn in Egypt. On this night the promise-making period that\\n    began with God\\'s call to Abraham concluded; the next day Jacob moved his\\n    people to Egypt. So the promises were given, restated and expanded over\\n    more than 215-years. After the promises (this promise-making period) came\\n    the 430-year sojourn in Egypt. Following this came the giving of the Law at\\n    Mount Sinai. Thus sandwiched in between the development of the promises and\\n    the giving of the Law were those 430-years in Egypt. First came years of\\n    making the promises/covenant. Then came the 430-year sojourn in Egypt.\\n    Following that God gave Israel the Law at Mount Sinai. Thus, from the [end\\n    of the] promise and covenant making period to the law was precisely\\n    430-years. Paul was not contradicting the words of Moses but was actually\\n    confirming them. This interpretation fits perfectly with the testimonies of\\n    the other three witnesses.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    So which is better? To make Paul\\'s words of a very general nature to agree\\n    with the specific words of the other three witnesses or to make all the\\n    words of the three witnesses agree with one interpretation of when the\\n    430-years in Paul\\'s statement began? Logically, the first approach seems\\n    preferable. Thus, it is sound hermeneutics to understand that Paul\\'s words\\n    agree with those of God, Moses and Stephen. The New Testament confirms the\\n    words of God in Stephen\\'s message to the leaders of Israel and the words of\\n    Moses in Paul\\'s argument to the Galatians. In contrast to the traditional\\n    215-year view, the Bible gives no less than four passages to emphasize that\\n    it was 430-years that Israel sojourned in Egypt. All the statements and\\n    numbers in these four passages are harmonized without conflict. Inerrancy\\n    is honored.\\n</p>\\n<h4 id=\"path-to-violating-scripture\">\\n    Path to Violating Scripture\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\n    In retrospect, where did the practice of preferring numbers to words begin?\\n    As stated in the previous chapter, it all began when people, thinking they\\n    were taking the Bible literally, added the numbers in Levi\\'s line and\\n    realized that Amram could not possibly be the immediate father of Aaron if\\n    Israel were in Egypt 430-years. They eventually concluded the 430-years\\n    referred to the entire time from Abraham\\'s arrival in Canaan until the\\n    Exodus. That left just 215-years in Egypt. It was possible for Amram to be\\n    the immediate father of Aaron if Israel were in Egypt just 215-years. But\\n    unfortunately the obvious meaning of many other words of Scripture would\\n    need to be reinterpreted in difficult and unnatural ways.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Why do all that to Scripture when it is clear that Hebrew genealogies can\\n    be as narrow as Adam begetting Cain or as broad as Jesus being the son of\\n    David? When one recognizes the nature and function of Hebrew genealogies,\\n    the record of Amram begetting Aaron is obviously a skipping of multiple\\n    generations. It is the broad sense of Amram being a forefather of Aaron, of\\n    Aaron coming from the loins of Amram. Once this is understood, the\\n    Scriptures become whole, no contradictions, no errors, no explaining away\\n    clear verses, no ignoring difficult verses.\\n</p>\\n<h4 id=\"conclusion-number-one\">\\n    Conclusion Number One: Israel Dwelt in Egypt 430-years\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\n    The debate over whether Israel dwelt in Egypt 430 or 215-years is not\\n    between those who accept the Bible and those who question the Bible. Both\\n    sides believe the Bible is inerrant and the final authority. Motive\\n    distinguishes the two positions. 430-years didn\\'t work with an uninformed\\n    view of the genealogies, so long ago the traditional view found a way to\\n    cut the 430-years down to 215. Today, the typical Evangelical Christian has\\n    never heard the 215-year view taught or even talked about. When he reads\\n    about those who reduce the 430-year Egyptian sojourn, he is shocked. He\\n    asks, \"How could anyone who claims to honor Scripture treat it with such\\n    callousness?\"\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    He might even reexamine what Scripture actually says and find that four\\n    authors address the subject. The first author is no less than God Himself\\n    who promised to make Abraham a great nation but warned that the path to\\n    nationhood would involve exploitation and servitude. To give hope God\\n    revealed that difficult time would end in 400 years. Centuries later Moses\\n    wrote a description of the deliverance from Egypt and said that the\\n    deliverance came 430-years to the day after Israel went down to Egypt.\\n    While God\\'s 400 years only spoke about the affliction time in Egypt, he\\n    would realize that Moses\\' 430-years referred to the entire time in Egypt\\n    which included a period at the beginning when Jacob\\'s family was given good\\n    land and was not afflicted. Thus, the two periods, 400 and 430, were\\n    actually the overall period and then a period within the overall period.\\n    They were true periods, each supporting the other. Thus, no less than God\\n    and Moses attested to 430-years in Egypt.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    He comes to the New Testament which states both the 400 year and 430-year\\n    numbers. Stephen rehearsed Israel\\'s history and quoted God\\'s statement\\n    about 400 years of affliction in a land belonging to others while Paul\\n    cited Moses 430-year statement as the time from the making of promises and\\n    covenant to the giving of the Mosaic Law during the first year of\\n    wilderness wandering. Thus he finds that both the Old and New Testaments\\n    attest to 430-years in Egypt. With his study completed, he concludes,\\n    \"Certainly the testimony of these authorities should be adequate. If not,\\n    how can a Christian trust anything Scripture says?\"\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Motivation also tests the two interpretations. True motivation attempts to\\n    determine what the passages in question say. The 430 view is motivated by\\n    this desire while the 215 view is motivated by a desire to reduce the\\n    430-years in some way. If there are compelling reasons to understand a\\n    passage in some other way than its normal meaning, it may be necessary to\\n    explore the subject passages in unconventional ways. But if not, such\\n    tampering must be avoided. The 215-year view has no such compelling reason.\\n    Four hundred thirty years is not harmful to Scripture. Instead, it is\\n    beneficial because it forces the interpreter to take the genealogies as\\n    they were meant to be taken. Finally, while four authors support the\\n    430-year number, nowhere does a single author of Scripture suggest or imply\\n    Israel was in Egypt only 215-years.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    While trying to avoid being dogmatic, we are stating what appears to most\\n    to be obvious. It appears that beyond question Israel\\'s sojourn in Egypt\\n    lasted 430-years. To say otherwise is to teach something the Scripture\\n    simply never says and to deny what the Scripture says multiple times. Two\\n    hundred fifteen and years dishonors Scripture. It is not the way that\\n    inerrancy treats Scripture. Once a person has a clear understanding of the\\n    four witnesses\\' testimonies, a 430-year sojourn in Egypt can no longer be\\n    disputed.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    This 430-year number is like a brick wall. All those who throw themselves\\n    against it only injure themselves while the wall stands. Hopefully they\\n    will give glory to God who has revealed clearly a 430-year sojourn in Egypt\\n    and abandon this longstanding distraction.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    A 430-year Egyptian sojourn would seemingly push Ussher\\'s date for the\\n    Flood back 215-years, from 2348 BC to 2563 BC (in truth it doesn\\'t because\\n    of other errors). This will make the historians and archaeologists a little\\n    happier since they find much human activity during that span. However, if\\n    the people who emphasize numbers over words in Scripture have made other\\n    errors in their calculations, the 2563 BC number will need further\\n    correcting.\\n</p>\\n<h4 id=\"conclusion-number-two\">\\n    Conclusion Number Two: Genealogies May be Abbreviated\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\n    Chapter one showed that a 430-year sojourn in Egypt would require\\n    understanding that the Levi-Aaron line of Exodus chapter six was\\n    abbreviated. This chapter shows that beyond doubt Israel did sojourn in\\n    Egypt 430-years. These two facts raise two alternatives: either the Bible\\n    is in error at this point or the Levi-Aaron genealogy is abbreviated. The\\n    first alternative is both unacceptable and unnecessary. Therefore, the only\\n    other alternative must be accepted: their genealogy is selective rather\\n    than comprehensive.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Such a conclusion is a stumbling block to some. But it need not be. When\\n    they examine the many ways Scripture uses genealogies, they will realize\\n    that Exodus six acceptably and accurately uses Hebrew genealogies. This\\n    insight will be a momentous advance for those who cherish Scripture as\\n    God-breathed.\\n</p>\\n<h4 id=\"looking-ahead\">\\n    Looking Ahead\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\n    God, Moses, Stephen, Paul-four witnesses. Are four enough? In Deuteronomy\\n    17:6 the very life of a person rested in the hands of just two or three\\n    witnesses. If someone turned to idolatry God said to put them to death on\\n    the evidence of two or three witnesses. This principle regarding the\\n    required number of witnesses to establish a fact carried through to the New\\n    Testament church. Paul said that two or three witnesses were necessary to\\n    establish a charge against an elder (I Timothy 5:19). The testimony of four\\n    witnesses more than meets the biblical requirement for establishing the\\n    truth.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Having established by four witnesses that Israel dwelt in Egypt 430-years\\n    and therefore the Levi-Aaron genealogy of Exodus six is abbreviated, our\\n    initial goal has been reached. While we could end here, some may still\\n    believe Abraham\\'s call came in Haran and therefore three witness for\\n    430-years while one witnesses for 215-years. We will next examine extensive\\n    evidence for that call coming in Ur, not Haran, leaving all four witnesses\\n    solidly in the 430-year Egyptian sojourn camp. Then we will take a careful\\n    look at Jacob\\'s life to correct details which have also been altered to fit\\n    the numbers over words approach. In effect this book provides a fresh look\\n    at some of the key moments in the lives of Abraham and Jacob, a prize for\\n    those wanting to correct mistaken notions regarding aspects of their lives.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Once these interpretations are addressed, we can get to the heart of this\\n    paper, a look at the nature and function of Hebrew genealogies. Chapter\\n    five addresses how family relationship words can be used in both narrow and\\n    broad senses; chapter six gives numerous examples of condensed genealogies\\n    and chapter seven provides many evidences for Shem\\'s line (Genesis 11)\\n    being condensed. And so it goes. Hold on to your hats.

For his words to have this meaning, God's call\\n    had to come when Abraham was living in Haran, a position that is fatally\\n    flawed. Such an idea comes both from misinterpreting the Scriptural record\\n    of certain events and oversimplifying how God was preparing Abraham for a\\n    life of faith. Yet the subject is complex and is not settled with a few\\n    simple proof texts.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    This chapter begins by noting the many contributions to Abraham's total\\n    life story in those first 75 years overlooked by Ussher and his followers.\\n    In the process most readers will gain an entirely new appreciation for this\\n    one whom God used to found the Jewish people and birth our Savior. Those\\n    years were not unlike the early years of Moses, Paul, Joseph and David\\n    whose stops and starts laid groundworks for their future ministries.\\n    Understanding these puts flesh on the bones of Abraham's life of growing\\n    faith. Although sinning and doubting along the way, this man who worshipped\\n    idols in Ur with his kindred, (Joshua 24:2) came to build altars to the one\\n    and only true God in Haran so that when he arrived in Canaan his first\\n    response was to build an altar (Genesis 12:7-8). How did that happen?\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    When the call came in Ur, even Abraham's idolatrous father must have been\\n    awed by his son's claims that if he followed the true God's leading, God\\n    would make of him a great nation and in him all the families of the earth\\n    would be blessed (Genesis 12:2-3). Apparently once Terah realized that he\\n    could not talk his son out of this insane plan to walk away from his life\\n    in Ur, he began to wonder if maybe God did appear to him after all. Terah\\n    had taken delight in his son's impressive achievements in Ur and had the\\n    strongest confidence in this only son still in his household. In the end,\\n    with his final years looming, his only option was to accompany his son\\n    although some of this remains a mystery. We can only surmise but history\\n    points to difficult times ahead for Ur. God often uses circumstances in His\\n    leading. Perhaps in this case the winds of war were already in the air.\\n    Whew, away from that!\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Along the journey the family most likely questioned Abraham: what next? God\\n    had said \\\"to go to the land that I will show you\\\" (Genesis 12:1). Hebrews\\n    11:8 concurs:\\n</p>\\n<p class='verse>\\n    <strong>\\n        By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to a place that he\\n        was to receive as an inheritance. And he went out, not knowing where he\\n        was going.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    In a way not explained by Scripture God was showing Abraham where to go\\n    just as He had said. At each fork somehow God led him. As they journeyed\\n    from Ur Abraham confidently told his party whether to go left, right or\\n    straight ahead. Because this went on for nearly two months Abraham's party\\n    must have felt better and better about the move with each passing day. Then\\n    suddenly about 700 miles from Ur Abraham didn't know which way to go.\\n    Whatever method God used to lead him stopped, vanished, disappeared into\\n    thin air. So there they waited and waited. Not a sign, not a hint from God.\\n    Finally, after some days, heavy with disappointment, they began to discuss\\n    what went wrong. Abraham knew-while he had separated from his country and\\n    relatives, he had not separated from his father's idolatrous household. Now\\n    what?\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The decision was made to settle in Haran. Scripture doesn't tell how far\\n    Haran was from where the leading stopped but it does report that \\\"when they\\n    came to Haran, they settled there\\\" (Genesis 11:31) even though they\\n    eventually learned that the destination was Canaan. After all this divine\\n    leading and the visitation that triggered it, Abraham would never be the\\n    same. Now he knew there was a great difference between the idolatrous gods\\n    of Ur and the true God who spoke to him in Ur and led him as far as Haran.\\n    He must know this true God. Information was available to those so motivated\\n    and Abraham began to gather that information and seek this God. With the\\n    passing of time he began to worship this true God. He began to build altars\\n    as those before him who worshipped the true God had done.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    For the next 10 or 15 years Abraham got to know the true God better and\\n    better and worshiped at the altar more and more frequently. This in itself\\n    is remarkable but another remarkable thing began to happen. The members of\\n    Terah's household began joining Abraham at the altar. Eventually,\\n    apparently Terah's entire household worshiped at the altar. He was in his\\n    final days and now totally dependent on his son. Very possibly before the\\n    end he also joined with the others at Abraham's altar. Oh, how marvelous\\n    was the grace of God in allowing this family situation to play out in Haran\\n    over those years.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The proof for all this is the large evidence of faith demonstrated by\\n    Abraham's household once they reached Canaan-immediately worshipping at\\n    altars upon arrival, ascribing faith to Lot (II Peter 2:7), choosing for\\n    Hebron and the suicidal mission of rescuing Lot from the invasion of the\\n    Mesopotamian armies.\\n</p>\\n<h4 id=\\\"abrahams-place-in-the-birth-order-of-terahs-sons\\\">Abraham's Place in the Birth Order of Terah's Sons</h4>\\n\\n<p>\\n    Piecing together those 75 years before the move to Canaan requires solving\\n    the issue of birth order of Terah's three sons. Stephen said that Abraham\\n    moved to Canaan after Terah died (Acts 7:4). He died at the age of 205\\n    (Genesis 11:32). Since Abraham arrived in Canaan at the age of 75 (Genesis\\n    12:4), he was born when Terah was 130 years old (205-75=130). Because Terah\\n    began fathering his three sons when he was 70, Abraham had a brother who\\n    was 60 years his senior (130-70=60).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    But Abraham is generally considered the oldest son. Twice Scripture names\\n    Terah's three sons and in both cases the order is Abraham, Nahor and Haran\\n    (Genesis 11:26, 27). People assume the sons are named in the order of their\\n    birth. While this is the normal practice of Scripture, sometimes it names\\n    sons in the order of their importance or impact in the plan of God. Such is\\n    the case here. Abraham would touch the entire world. Nahor would supply\\n    wives to Abraham's descendants. Haran died in relative obscurity. As to why\\n    the three brothers were born over a period of 60 years, Terah apparently\\n    had a fertility problem. This explanation seems reasonable because his\\n    daughter Sarah was barren, his granddaughter Rebekah also was barren and\\n    even his great-granddaughter Rachel was barren.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    As to the ages of Abraham's two brothers, Nahor and Haran, Scripture\\n    provides important hints to work with. First, Nahor married Haran's\\n    daughter Milcah. Second, Haran's name suggests Terah enjoyed business\\n    success at the trade route town by that name before moving to Ur. Third,\\n    Haran died before Abraham left Ur. These three details point to Haran being\\n    older than Nahor. When was Nahor born? He had eight sons by Haran's\\n    daughter and was no longer living with his father when God called Abraham.\\n    Further Abraham was attached to Lot, the son of Haran, not his brother\\n    Nahor. These details indicate Nahor would have been 30 or 40 years older\\n    than Abraham. Now a possible picture emerges: Haran was born when Terah was\\n    70. Nahor was born 20-40 years later. Abraham was the youngest brother,\\n    born 60 years after Haran.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    More details emerge. Abraham married his father's daughter by a second\\n    wife. Sarah was ten years younger than Abraham. They were married long\\n    enough in Ur to discover that unlike her sister-in-law, she was barren.\\n    This seems to indicate that Abraham lived many adult years in Ur. The age\\n    for adulthood was 25 at the time. Possibly Abraham married Sarah once she\\n    reached that age. Then, 25-30 years of marriage would be adequate to\\n    realize that Sarah could not have children and would place the call of God\\n    when Abraham was 60 or 65. If so, Haran died by the age of 130 or 135 and\\n    Terah was 190 or 195. Living 35-40 adult years in Ur allowed Abraham to\\n    learn and achieve much and drink deeply from Ur's culture while 10-15 years\\n    of mature adult life in Haran would have been enough time to become wealthy\\n    both materially and spiritually .\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <h4 id=\\\"nephew-older-than-uncle\\\">Nephew Older Than Uncle</h4>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    With Lot's father 60 years older than Abraham and Lot's sister marrying\\n    Abraham's other brother, Lot himself must have been some years older than\\n    Abraham. Does this fit the context? Actually, Lot being older than Abraham\\n    makes better sense of what Scripture reveals of their relationship. One\\n    gets the impression that Abraham was more attached to Lot than Lot was to\\n    Abraham which would be expected if Lot were older than Abraham.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Abraham's real older brother, Nahor, was preoccupied with a growing family.\\n    Meanwhile Lot continued to live in the household of his grandfather. So\\n    Lot, not Nahor, became the \\\"big brother\\\" figure in Abraham's life. This\\n    bonding would be a new explanation for why Abraham was so loyal to him and\\n    would also explain why Abraham offered Lot first choice of the land when\\n    they separated (Genesis 13). It would further explain how Lot could go his\\n    separate way and seek out Sodom rather than staying close to Abraham. He\\n    thought for himself. He had his own views. He did what he pleased. In\\n    summary, if Lot were the elder, he would have been something of a big\\n    brother in Abraham's childhood and this early relationship colored\\n    Abraham's relationship with him in adulthood.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    As to Terah, he was becoming infirm and dependent on others. His oldest son\\n    was dead and the other was living on his own. Abraham was the only son left\\n    to care for him when God's call came. As it played out, this youngest son\\n    and his daughter cared for Terah until his death. These also became the\\n    obvious heirs to Terah's household along with Lot who must have received an\\n    inheritance in place of his father who was the oldest son. This would also\\n    explain where Lot got the vast herds that forced him and Abraham to\\n    separate shortly after arriving in Canaan.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <h4 id=\\\"life-in-ur\\\">Life in Ur</h4>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Of all the cities on the face of the earth in which to live in Abraham's\\n    day, Ur would have won top honors. It was the Paris of its time, even more\\n    advanced than any city in Egypt, leading in wealth, education, security,\\n    comfort and pleasure. Standing at the head of the Persian Gulf, it\\n    controlled the mouth of the Euphrates. Thousands of tablets have been\\n    recovered from the site that reflect this period. Numerous royal graves\\n    were found unrobbed and filled with historical artifacts. The temple\\n    complex housed a school. Sir Leonard Woolley excavated the levels of Ur\\n    from 1922-1934 and learned from student work tablets the extensive\\n    knowledge taught its youth, even high school level math. Consequently, the\\n    free population was both intelligent and well educated. The monarchy and\\n    the worship of the moon god were unifying institutions.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Archaeologists report that most of Ur's population consisted of\\n    servants/slaves. If 90% were not completely free and the country's total\\n    population numbered 250,000, then only 25,000 were actual citizens.\\n    Abraham's kin could have numbered in the hundreds and wielded a significant\\n    influence within the free population. About Abraham's time Ur had a\\n    powerful and successful army. At one point it was the dominant force in\\n    Mesopotamia, establishing hegemony all the way up the Euphrates to the\\n    Mediterranean. Free citizens made up the higher echelons. If Abraham had\\n    followed a military career, he would have studied military science and\\n    worked up to a significant command position. Whether or not the military\\n    was his career, his military savvy shines in the following event.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <h4 id='campaign-of-four-mesopotamian-armies'>The Campaign of Four Mesopotamian Armies</h4>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    In an astonishing military victory Abraham defeated a coalition of four\\n    Mesopotamian armies some nine years after he arrived in Canaan. After\\n    serving the King of Elam 12 years the population center where Lot moved\\n    rebelled. Scripture is clear about the military force that retaliated\\n    (Genesis 14:1-16)-its size, objective and success. The king, Chedorlaomer,\\n    brought his army from an area to the east of Lower Mesopotamia, today's\\n    southwestern Iran. These people were later called Persians. After Abraham\\n    followed God to Haran, Chedorlaomer's country defeated Ur and destroyed the\\n    city. In short order Elam extended its governance all the way to the\\n    Sodom-Gomorrah region. Now its present ruler came with three\\n    allies-Amraphel king of Shinar (Babylon), Arioch king of Ellasar (Larsa,\\n    longtime rival of Ur) and Tidal, king of Nations (apparently from Upper\\n    Mesopotamia).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    These four kings controlled an enormous area, from Upper Mesopotamia to\\n    well beyond Lower Mesopotamia, 500 to 1500 miles distant from Sodom. One\\n    commentator suggested this force could have numbered 100,000 soldiers.\\n    Their columns stretched for miles. As they left the Euphrates and marched\\n    southwest towards Sodom, raiders from the badlands to the east plundered\\n    their columns and supply lines. Distracted from their original mission they\\n    began fighting people group after people group to the east of their route\\n    (Genesis 14:5-6). These actions eventually placed them to the south and\\n    east of their goal.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Turning west they encountered and defeated the desert people that occupied\\n    the lands south of Sodom. Finally they reached their objective, attacking\\n    the Sodomites but in a surprise maneuver only hinted at in Scripture. The\\n    defenders expected the enemy to approach from the south but seem to have\\n    been pinned against the bitumen pits. This would point to an unexplained\\n    backdoor route descending the hills to the west and only lightly guarded by\\n    the defenders. In this battle the consortium utterly crushed the five kings\\n    that governed the heavily populated Sodom-Gomorrah civilization bowl. With\\n    no opposition remaining, the victors began the long march home loaded with\\n    plunder and the population whom they would sell into slavery. Abraham's\\n    \\\"big brother\\\" was headed for a miserable future.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <h4 id='abrahams-private-army'>Abraham's Private Army</h4>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    An escapee brought the bad news to Abraham who immediately gathered his\\n    forces to free Lot. The odds at this point appeared to be 100 to 1. This\\n    was certain suicide, unless Abraham was a military genius. Scripture\\n    suggests as much, relating that Abraham \\\"led forth his trained men, born in\\n    his house, 318 of them.\\\" (Genesis 14:14). Abraham had his own private army.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Until now Scripture had said nothing about Abraham training his servants\\n    for combat. From what happens in the battle one must conclude that they had\\n    military skills equal to the invaders who were professional soldiers,\\n    battle hardened after an unexpectedly difficult possibly year-and-a-half\\n    long campaign. With Abraham about 84 years old the youngest of his fighters\\n    would have been born when Abraham was 64 years old or 11 years before he\\n    left Haran for Canaan. The fact that they were born in his house indicates\\n    he began their training at an early age and that this practice had been\\n    going on for many years.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    What did these trained fighters look like? As a general over his army\\n    Abraham trained them to handle lethal weapons and kill. His forces knew how\\n    to work together to overcome far superior forces. They were cunning, strong\\n    and had tremendous endurance. Where could Abraham possibly have gained this\\n    military knowledge? You guessed it-in Ur. During his early years in Ur its\\n    army was having great success. Now he had an army like Ur's in his very own\\n    household. His men could face the best from Mesopotamia. Would it be too\\n    much to say Abraham's 318 were among the best soldiers alive in their day?\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <h4 id='abrahams-amorite-confederates'>Abraham's Amorite Confederates</h4>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Even more remarkable, Abraham had Amorite confederates who joined this\\n    suicidal venture. Why? They had to have confidence in Abraham's knowledge\\n    of warfare. This explains another mystery. Why would the Amorites share\\n    their land with Abraham in the first place? Shortly after arriving in\\n    Canaan the range land proved insufficient for Abraham's and Lot's cattle so\\n    they separated. Lot set his tent towards Sodom while Abraham moved to\\n    Hebron. What Scripture doesn't explain is that Hebron was the highest\\n    ground in Israel, even higher than Jerusalem which is a half mile above sea\\n    level. It was one of the most out of the way and defensible locations\\n    Abraham could choose. Furthermore, it had limited access. It was at a dead\\n    end. Abraham literally took the high ground. But it was occupied by\\n    Amorites. So while this act displays great military savvy, how would the\\n    Amorites ever be persuaded to share their land with him?\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    First, Abraham proved to be a diplomat and a business man. Somehow he\\n    showed them that his presence would be to their advantage. Second, he must\\n    have shared his military experiences from Ur. The Amorites had never heard\\n    such things. They were impressed. His fighters and the Amorite fighters\\n    would have contests. Abraham's were superior. Abraham began telling them\\n    how he trained his fighters. They formed a mutual defense alliance. Over a\\n    five or six year period the Amorites greatly increased their military\\n    skills and came to have unflagging confidence in Abraham.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <h3 id='a-military-victory-for-the-books'>A Military Victory for the Books</h3>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Now Lot and his family were prisoners. Abraham loved his nephew and saw his\\n    interest in the true God (\\\"righteous Lot\\\" II Peter 2:7). But what chance\\n    did Abraham have against the ocean of invaders? Again, his knowledge of\\n    warfare. He would know that once the invader's campaign was successful, the\\n    kings and most of their soldiers would head for home at top speed. At a\\n    much slower pace a small but adequate force would return with the vast\\n    plunder and the many slaves. Possibly only 5,000 to 10,000 soldiers\\n    remained, but still the odds were five or ten to one.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    But Abraham had one more ace up his sleeve. He knew that discipline would\\n    be almost non-existent now that the army had vanquished all opposition. The\\n    coalition had been fighting for over a year. This was a time to celebrate\\n    and those celebrations typically came in the form of nightly drunken orgies\\n    at the expense of the female prisoners. Apparently even nighttime\\n    reconnaissance patrols were neglected. From his days in Ur Abraham\\n    understood the various plans for night watches, passwords, trumpet signals,\\n    command structure, and camp layout. He also knew the typical contingency\\n    plans for night attacks. In other words, he knew the military science of\\n    Southern Mesopotamia. Further, he and senior members of his household knew\\n    the various languages of Mesopotamia and could use those languages to get\\n    inside the enemy's defenses. Further yet, he had grazed his flocks for\\n    years through the entire area and knew every trail like the back of his\\n    hand. Undoubtedly he sent scouts ahead to gather intelligence. Here in\\n    abbreviated fashion is the scriptural account:\\n</p>\\n<p class='verse'>\\n    <strong>\\n        And he divided his forces against them by night, he and his servants,\\n        and defeated them and pursued them to Hobah, north of Damascus. Genesis\\n        14:15.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Abraham's plan was to strike in a night attack from multiple directions.\\n    This plan employed a major strategy of military science-surprise. But it\\n    also violated two principles-attacking at night and dividing one's force\\n    against a superior force. It was very, very risky. There would be either\\n    great reward or great loss. Abraham was the overall commander with three\\n    Amorite bands taking orders from him. Possibly his force numbered 600-700.\\n    Abraham and senior officers had to have gone over the plan in great detail.\\n    They caught up with the invaders where the city of Dan would later be\\n    established on the northern boundary of Israel about 110 air miles north of\\n    Hebron. The forced march could hardly have been accomplished in four\\n    exhausting days. Along the way they encountered injured and dead prisoners\\n    and a trail of their discarded possessions. By the time they reached Dan,\\n    though exhausted, they were highly motivated.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Abraham's night attack was a complete success. He could have found wounded\\n    or dead soldiers along the way and taken their uniforms to dress some of\\n    his troops to infiltrate their lines. Perhaps he impersonated a commander\\n    of the invaders and gave guards contradictory orders, using his mastery of\\n    the languages of Lower Mesopotamia and his intimate knowledge of their\\n    military operations. Whatever strategy he used, he utterly surprised and\\n    routed the invaders. He drove the fleeing confederation fifty miles, to a\\n    place called Hobah somewhere north of Damascus. He knew that if the army\\n    regrouped and counterattacked it would all be over for him and his allies.\\n    No enemy soldier could be spared; it was either complete victory or\\n    eventual disaster. Even one escapee could provide the information needed\\n    for a retaliatory strike the next year.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <h4 id='abrahams-best-defense'>Abraham's Best Defense</h4>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The next spring when armies go to war found Abraham knotted up in fear.\\n    This would be the time when the Mesopotamians would return to wreak\\n    vengeance on him and his neighbors. Where does this idea come from? The\\n    very next chapter records how God appears to him in a vision and said,\\n    \\\"Fear not, Abram. I am your shield; your reward shall be very great.\\\"\\n    (Genesis 15:1). Abraham had dared to strike the flower of Mesopotamia. Now\\n    he feared the worst. But he did not have to fear because the God of\\n    creation would be his shield. Further, apparently he was having second\\n    thoughts about having lifted up his hand \\\"to the LORD God Most High,\\n    Possessor [Creator] of heaven and earth, &#8230;not to take a thread or a\\n    sandal strap or anything that [belonged to Sodom] lest [the king of Sodom]\\n    should say, 'I have made Abram rich'\\\" Genesis 14:22-23. Had that been the\\n    right thing to do? Yes, because for that stand God promised that his reward\\n    would be <strong>very</strong> great.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <h4 id='75-years-of-preparation'>75 Years of Preparation in Ur and Haran (see also Appendix 3.4)</h4>\\n    \\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Abraham's military skills point to many adult years in Ur, not the sleepy\\n    village of Urfa 25 miles northwest of Haran while his altars point to years\\n    of growing closer to the LORD in Haran. During the Haran years Terah's\\n    influence waned while Abraham's influence grew. The vast numbers of\\n    Abraham's cattle when he separated from Lot and the 318 shepherd/warriors\\n    born in his house indicate that Abraham did not separate from his father's\\n    household but rather influenced his father's household to worship the God\\n    who led him to Canaan.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Genesis 14 provides a remarkable fit of Scripture and secular history with\\n    regard to Abraham's early years. It records that the Sodom-Gomorrah\\n    confederation had paid tribute to the king of Elam for 12 years. When they\\n    did not pay in the 13<sup>th</sup>, the war machine from Mesopotamia came\\n    to teach them a lesson in the 14<sup>th</sup> year led by Elam. The\\n    campaign lasted two years. Secular history records that Ur reached its\\n    zenith during the 97 golden-year rule of the five kings of the Third\\n    Dynasty. It is an historical fact that its end came suddenly at the hands\\n    of Elam. It broke Ur's control of the lower Euphrates in a military\\n    invasion that overwhelmed the capital itself, burned its palace and\\n    enslaved its population. In a strange and as yet not understood alliance\\n    with other Mesopotamian powers only specifically reported in Scripture to\\n    date, Elam extended its control all the way to Sodom and Gomorrah. Had\\n    Abraham not left Ur in obedience to God, he would have lost his freedom and\\n    wealth if not his life.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The timeline looks like this: Scripture clearly indicates the passing of 14\\n    years, from the first year in which the pentapolis paid tribute to Elam\\nuntil Elam and its allies arrived to punish them for not paying in the 13    <sup>th</sup>. The time needed to forge alliances and establish control\\n    from Ur up the Euphrates and then down the Jordan Valley to the five cities\\n    is unknown. This could have been accomplished in as little as a year or\\n    two. Thus, an estimated minimum of 16 years passed from the fall of Ur to\\n    the punishment dealt the five cities.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Sometime before the fall of Ur, God called Abraham. Upon responding to the\\n    call he lived an unknown number of years in Haran. Then God led him from\\n    Haran to Canaan and when Elam arrived to punish the rebels Abraham had been\\n    in Canaan approximately nine years. This is known because of the next\\n    sequence of events in Abraham's life: God's appearance in a vision and the\\n    blood covenant the next spring, the birth of Ishmael a year later and the\\n    birth of Isaac when Abraham was 100 and Ishmael was 14. Since Abraham was\\n    75 when he arrived in Canaan, he would be 84 when the invaders defeated\\n    Sodom and enslaved Lot.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Secular history gives various ranges of dates for the glorious years of the\\n    Third Dynasty of Ur. The ancient cuneiform documents are consistent in\\n    their records of the names of the five kings of the Third Dynasty, the\\n    number of years each reigned and the major achievements of each. It was the\\n    second of five that actually raised Ur to dominance. However, secular\\n    history has been unable to anchor their 97-year total reign to a fixed\\n    time. Instead it offers various ranges of dates, from early to late, to\\n    moderate, etc. They differ by as much as at total of 155 years. The\\n    earliest range ends at 2150 BC and the latest ends at 1995 BC. Abraham was\\n    75 at 2091 so he fits well into the secular range of dates.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Two entire chapters of the Bible come out of Elam's rise (Genesis 14 and\\n    15). Is that enough to set us thinking that maybe Abraham was an important\\n    figure in Ur? Could it be that at the time of God's call, Abraham was well\\n    into the politics or military of Ur and did not like the way negotiations\\n    were going between his country and Elam? Could it be that due to the\\n    growing problems facing Ur's leaders, he was not so certain about Ur's\\n    future after all? Could it be that when God called, for the first time in\\n    his life he might actually consider leaving Ur? We can only wonder but we\\n    do know that God's timing is perfect.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Here is another thought to chew on: Elam's having conquered the Jordan\\n    Valley just years before Abraham arrived in Canaan would explain why he\\n    could move about so freely. The long established powers of the land had\\n    been shaken to their roots and were busy recovering and rebuilding after\\n    Elam swept through so they paid little attention to this man and his many\\n    flocks and shepherds.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Finally, in an entire different vein, Elam only dominated Southern\\n    Mesopotamia for a short time. Then in some as yet unexplained way the\\n    alliance or one of its members turned on Elam and its power was broken in\\n    that region until the rise of the Persian Empire 1500 years later. A\\n    215-year sojourn in Egypt would place the birth of Abraham long after\\n    Elam's dominance in Mesopotamia and Sodom. If that were the case, Genesis\\n    14 would be fiction. Further, rivals of Ur governed that city-state once\\n    Elam's control had been broken. So whether it was Elam or Ur's rivals, such\\n    a time would not have been conducive to Terah and his relatives thriving in\\n    Ur. If his kinsmen survived at all, it would have been because they fled\\n    the country. If they returned, they would have been involved in picking up\\n    the pieces and living under the control of various other powers and that is\\n    not how secular sources pictures the Ur of Abraham's day.\\n</p>\\n    <h3 id='scriptural-support-that-abrahams-call-came-in-ur'>Scriptural Support that Abraham's Call Came in Ur</h3>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    We are convinced that God's call came to Abraham in Ur, not Haran, and that\\n    he spent a number of years in Haran before God led him the rest of the way\\n    to Canaan. But hyper literalists who bend all Scripture to the numbers in\\n    Shem's genealogy reject this position. To support their 215-year Egyptian\\n    sojourn view, they interpret the Apostle Paul's words in Galatians 3 to\\n    mean that God called Abraham in Haran, not Ur and that he immediately\\n    followed God to Canaan. Then 430-years later God gave Israel the Law on\\n    Mount Sinai immediately following the Exodus. They interpret the details of\\n    Abraham's life to fit this view. Book after book repeats this idea. The\\n    Apostle is their only hope even though they misinterpret his argument.

In the first half of this chapter we\\n    showed that such a view is ruled out by the events in Abraham's life. The\\n    rest of the chapter will look at specific statements of Scripture. The\\n    information will be organized around eight Old Testament passages, one New\\n    Testament passage and an argument from silence. These ten arguments show\\n    beyond question the error of a Haran call and the 215-year sojourn behind\\n    it.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <h4 id='stephen-says-ur'>Stephen Says \\\"Ur\\\"</h4>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    In the days following the resurrection of Christ, Stephen was full of grace\\n    and power, doing great wonders and signs among the people. Those who\\ndisputed with him could not withstand the wisdom and the    <strong><u>Spirit</u></strong> with which he spoke so they found people who\\n    falsely charged that Stephen spoke blasphemous words against Moses and God\\n    (Acts 6:8-11). This caused a disturbance that landed Stephen before the\\n    council where additional false charges were made. Stephen defended himself\\n    by reciting major events in the history of Israel, especially showing how\\n    the nation had established a pattern of rejecting God's messengers, last of\\n    all, the Messiah. Speaking by the Holy Spirit, he began with Jewish history\\n    that none could deny:\\n</p>\\n<p class='verse'>\\n    <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>\\n    <strong>\\n        Brothers and fathers, hear me.

And\\n        after his father died, God removed him from there into this land. Acts\\n        7:2-4.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Stephen said exactly what this book maintains are the facts and which those\\n    who add only numbers deny. His words are clear. They can't be interpreted\\n    to mean something else. So, in this case the numerologists don't deny or\\n    put a spin on what he said. Rather they say he made a slip of the tongue;\\n    what he said was erroneous. They say that inerrancy only guarantees that\\n    Stephen said these words, not that he had his facts straight. They say\\n    maybe he was under pressure and was rattled or maybe he was a young\\n    believer and didn't have a good grasp of the Old Testament. Somehow,\\n    Stephen misstated. Their numbers supplant words.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    It is true that inerrancy assures us of what someone said, even when they\\n    speak error. For instance, God had told Adam he would die if he ate fruit\\n    from a certain tree. Then the serpent said to Eve that she would not die if\\n    she ate from that tree (Genesis 3:4). Scripture accurately reported that\\n    the serpent said this even though what he said was untrue.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    This interpretative tool is useful, but used wrongly is dangerous. It can\\n    be used against any of the people in Scripture that said something the\\n    critic disagrees with. There must be strong evidence that the speaker spoke\\n    in error. Where is this evidence? Their only evidence is that it conflicts\\n    with their interpretation of what Paul said in Galatians three. So they say\\n    Paul was right; Stephen was wrong. We suggest both Stephen and Paul were\\n    right. When Paul's words are correctly understood, his words will agree\\n    completely with the words of Stephen. Invoking this extra ordinary use of\\n    the principle of inerrancy is incredulous, strained. After all, Stephen was\\n    full of the Holy Spirit:\\n</p>\\n<p class='verse'>\\n    <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>\\n    <strong>\\n        Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit. <sup>8</sup>\\n        Stephen, full of grace and power, was doing great wonders and signs\\n        among the people. <sup>10</sup>They could not withstand the wisdom and\\n        the Spirit with which he was speaking. Acts 6:5, 8, 10.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Recognizing that Stephen did speak accurately, others find a different\\n    interpretation of Acts 7:4 in order to maintain Abraham was the firstborn\\n    of Terah's sons. They observe that three personalities are found in verses\\n    2-4: God, Terah and Abraham. While verse four speaks of \\\"his father,\\\" it\\n    uses the personal pronoun four times. They say \\\"he removed him\\\" refers to\\n    Abraham removing his father Terah, not God removing Abraham. So rather than\\n    God leading Abraham on to Canaan after Terah died, this view says that\\n    sixty years after Abraham arrived in Canaan, his father died. Abraham then\\n    returned to Haran and brought his father's body to Canaan for burial. They\\n    emphasize that this is consistent with the Hebrew mindset of the importance\\n    of where one was buried and are adamant about this interpretation.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Such an explanation is strained and unnecessary. Why would Stephen begin\\n    his address with where Abraham's father was buried rather than that God\\n    Himself led the founder of the Jewish race to Canaan? This bad explanation\\n    demonstrates just how far the numbers over words folks will go to uphold\\n    their chronology from Shem to Abraham. They seem to suffer from\\n    over-literalism. This chapter previously showed another example of\\n    over-literalism. When Scripture says that at the age of 70 Terah fathered\\n    three sons, Abraham, Nahor and Haran, it was not naming his sons in the\\n    order of their birth, nor were they triplets, but they were named in the\\n    order of their importance and that Abraham was the youngest.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Now for the eight Old Testament passages that indicate the call came in Ur.\\n    Many times a single statement in the Bible is used to establish a biblical\\n    truth.

That would make sense if the call came in Ur\\n    because his father had compromised with the idolatry of that city and God\\n    wanted to get Abraham away from his father's influence. But if the call\\n    came in Haran after his father died, there would be no father with his\\n    idolatry to separate from. Death would have done the job. Further, by the\\n    time his father died, his father's household had turned from the idolatry\\n    of Ur and was worshiping at Abraham's altar in Haran.

It clearly says they departed from\\n    Ur, not Haran, to go to Canaan. While Terah was the patriarch and therefore\\n    nominally in charge, his son Abraham was determined to obey God and go to a\\n    land God would show him, so in effect, Terah was accompanying his son, not\\n    leading his son.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    4. <strong>Genesis 11:28</strong> says that \\\"Haran [Terah's oldest son]\\n    died in the presence of his father Terah in the land of his kindred, in Ur\\n    of the Chaldeans.\\\" Terah's kindred which we would call relatives lived in\\n    Ur, not Haran.

The 215-year view notes that the death of Terah is recorded in\\n    Genesis 11 while the call is recorded in Genesis 12. They conclude that the\\n    call was issued after Terah's death. When they read \\\"Now the LORD said to\\n    Abram&#8230;,\\\" they understand it to be saying, \\\"<strong>Then</strong> the\\n    LORD said to Abram&#8230;\\\" Genesis 12:1.

Not at all.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Genesis arranges biographical material in logical groupings. First one life\\n    or episode is stated, then another life or episode is presented.

What could be more important in the Abraham section than his call?\\n    Thus, the Abraham chapters begin with his call.

He organized those who had\\n    returned to Jerusalem and in the face of much opposition, the walls were\\n    rebuilt in just 52 days. Following this was a time of intense spiritual\\n    renewal. He records the Levites praying the words quoted above. They\\n    acknowledged that God had brought Abraham out of Ur of the Chaldeans. For\\n    fifteen hundred years the descendants of Abraham had understood that God\\n    first called Abraham in Ur and later in Canaan made a covenant with him to\\n    give his descendants that land. God's bringing was from Ur, not from Haran.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    7-8. <strong>Joshua 24:2-3. </strong>Two arguments come from these and\\n    other verses:\\n</p>\\n<p class='verse'>\\n    <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>\\n    <strong>\\n        Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, \\\"Long ago your fathers lived\\n        beyond the Euphrates, Terah, the father of Abraham and of Nahor, and\\n        they served other gods. <sup>3</sup>Then I took your father Abraham\\n        from beyond the River and led him through all the land of Canaan, and\\n        made his offspring many&#8230;\\\" Joshua 24:2-3.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Joshua specifically states that the fathers of Israel, Terah, Abraham and\\n    Nahor, practiced idolatry (\\\"served other gods\\\") before God took Abraham\\n    from where they lived \\\"beyond the Euphrates\\\" to Canaan. Their idolatry was\\n    real. They did this in Ur. God broke Abraham's idolatrous ways by\\n    separating him from the powerful idolatrous culture of Ur. In Haran Abraham\\n    established the worship of the true God in Terah's household. This worship\\n    continued during the lifetime of Isaac and was the faith Jacob was raised\\n    in. On the other hand Nahor followed Terah and Abraham to the general area\\n    around Haran but kept his idols. His grandson still held to them when Jacob\\n    came to live with him. Abraham's break with idolatry began when he moved\\n    from Ur, not from Haran. Therefore, the call came in Ur, not Haran.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Joshua's use of the phrase \\\"beyond the Euphrates\\\" also points to the call\\n    coming in Ur, not Haran. Altogether this phrase or similar words occur a\\n    dozen times more in Ezra and Nehemiah. The Euphrates is 1000 miles long. It\\n    begins near the mountains of Armenia, flows somewhat west, curves south and\\n    finally heads southeast to empty into the Persian Gulf. Haran is across the\\n    Euphrates River but the expression is mostly used for more than simply\\n    crossing the river. It is like a sweep of the hand to indicate a great\\n    distance. In most of its occurrences this phrase refers to Lower\\n    Mesopotamia. Thus it also confirms that the call came in Ur.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    9. While Scripture specifically says the call came in Ur as seen in the\\n    many references above, nowhere in the Old or New Testaments does it say or\\n    even hint that the call came in Haran. Arguments from silence in themselves\\n    do not establish a truth of Scripture. But when combined with positive\\n    declarative statements, they do add validity to the concept under\\n    consideration.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    In summary, the conditions of Abraham's call, to leave country, kindred,\\n    family and go to a land God would show him could only apply to the time\\n    when Abraham lived in Ur. Why is that so important? Abraham had to replace\\n    the idolatry that gripped Ur with faith in the one true God. Was he ready\\n    for that? He was ready to leave his kindred and Ur, but leaving his\\n    father's household was a road block. Refusing to stay behind they also\\n    would need to leave their idol worship and that was not easily done. So\\n    Haran became an important first step. It cannot be dismissed which the call\\n    coming in Haran does. Hebrews 11 makes it clear that by faith Abraham\\n    obeyed, going out to an unknown destination but ultimately expecting a city\\n    with better foundations, one whose builder and maker is God. Exactly what\\n    he left is very important: the world with all its idols, wealth and glamor.\\n    That was Ur, not Haran.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <h3 id='brief-chronology-of-abraham'>\\n        Brief Chronology of Abraham — Focusing on Elam's Defeat of Ur\\n    </h3>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Overview: Based on 1876 BC arrival in Egypt (Dates BC):\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    2006 - Birth of Jacob\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    2066 - Birth of Isaac\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    2166 - Birth of Abraham\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Firm (f) and estimated (e) dates for events in Abraham's early years:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    2166f - Birth of Abraham in the country of Ur, Mesopotamia\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    2156f - Birth of Sarah\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    2131e - Abraham marries Sarah when she turns 25; he is 35\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    2111e - 2106e - No children after 20-25 years of marriage; Sarah is\\n    obviously barren\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    2111e - 2106e - God calls Abraham to leave his country;\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Abraham accompanied by his father's household follows God's leading\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Abraham and Sarah with their father's household settle in Haran\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong> 2100e - Approximate year that Elam crushes Ur</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    2097e - Elam puts the Jordan Valley pentapolis under tribute\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    2091f - Terah dies; Abraham is 75; God leads him from Haran to Canaan\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    2082e - Mesopotamian armies defeat Jordan Valley pentapolis; Abraham\\n    rescues Lot\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    2081f - God's promises and prophecy to Abraham in Genesis 15\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    2080f - Birth of Ishmael\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    2066f - Birth of Isaac (when Abraham is 100 and Ishmael is 14)\\n</p>\\n\"},je={html:'<h2 class=\"chapter\">\\n    Chapter Four\\n</h2>\\n<h1>\\n    Jacob\\'s Life Requires a 430-Year Egyptian Sojourn\\n</h1>\\n<p>\\n    The record of Jacob\\'s life is a moving account of divine intervention and\\n    growing faith.

After twenty years of barrenness Isaac prayed for her and God\\n    granted his prayer. Miraculously, she became pregnant with twins. As the\\n    babies developed a strange thing began to happen. She sensed a struggling\\n    in her womb. She inquired of the LORD and He said:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Two nations are in your womb, and two peoples from within you shall be\\n    divided; the one shall be stronger than the other, the older shall serve\\n    the younger. Genesis 25:23.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The struggle in Rebekah\\'s womb foretold the future of the twins and their\\n    descendants. There would be strife, not harmony. There would be two\\n    separate nations pursuing their own interests, not family working toward a\\n    common goal. The older would dominate for a time but eventually the younger\\n    would prevail. Rebekah did not learn this from a soothsayer or even second\\n    hand from a prophet of God. No less than God Himself gave this information\\n    to her directly in answer to her prayer.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    As to their actual births, of Esau Scripture records \"The first came out\\n    red, all his body like a hairy cloak.\" Of Jacob, Scripture continues,\\n    \"afterward his brother came out with his hand holding Esau\\'s heel\" (Genesis\\n    25:26). The midwives must have been dismayed when the second of the twins\\n    immediately followed with his hand holding the heel of the first. Next,\\n    Scripture gives a snapshot of the direction the boys\\' lives took:\\n</p>\\n<p class=\"verse\">\\n    <strong>\\n        When the boys grew up, Esau was a skillful hunter, a man of the field,\\n        while Jacob was a quiet man, dwelling in tents. Genesis 25:27.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\n    In the above verse Scripture immediately advances from their birth to the\\n    two as grown men, reporting that the twins grew up to be very different.\\n    Hunting characterized the one, the quiet of home the other. Of Jacob Unger\\n    writes \"Jacob preferred the quiet of a home life to the active dangerous\\n    career of a hunter.\"<a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\" title=\"\">[1]</a> So\\n    Scripture is extremely brief about their early years. Just the struggling\\n    in the womb, God\\'s personal explanation and what characterized their adult\\n    years. How different is the story of their father Isaac and all Scripture\\n    told of his conception, birth, youth and adult years before marrying at the\\n    age of 40.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Scripture does not elaborate on what it meant to be a skillful hunter or a\\n    quiet man living in tents. It only hints at these two pursuits by saying\\n    \"Isaac loved Esau because he ate of his game, but Rebekah loved Jacob\"\\n    (Genesis 25:28). Esau wasn\\'t just the average hunter; he was \"skillful.\" He\\n    greatly enhanced the family table with his game. Because of this he was\\n    number one in his father\\'s books. Rebekah\\'s greater concern was the\\n    family\\'s livelihood. Because Jacob focused on learning and operating the\\n    family ranching business, he became number one in her books. While Esau\\n    loved to feel the adrenaline of the hunt, Jacob accepted the discipline of\\n    repetitive daily chores. That daily routine tied him down to a predictable\\n    schedule. These two men couldn\\'t have been more different.\\n</p>\\n<h3 id=\"purchasing-the-birthright\">\\n    Purchasing the Birthright\\n</h3>\\n<p>\\n    After explaining the direction of each twin\\'s life, Scripture discloses\\n    just one event in their adult lives before Esau married at the age of 40.\\n    One day Esau returned home from the hunt. Apparently he had pressed and\\n    pressed without success to the point of exhaustion. He asked Jacob for a\\n    bowl of his stew. This indicates that the quiet man was there at his\\n    typical station, doing something useful to sustain the family, this time\\n    cooking. Here is what happened:\\n</p>\\n<p class=\"verse\">\\n    <strong><sup>31</sup></strong>\\n    <strong>\\n        Jacob said, \"Sell me your birthright now.\" <sup>32</sup>Esau said, \"I\\n        am about to die; of what use is a birthright to me?\" <sup>33</sup>Jacob\\n        said, \"Swear to me now.\" So he swore to him and sold his birthright to\\n        Jacob. <sup>34b</sup>Thus Esau despised his birthright. Genesis\\n        25:31-33, 34b.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Birthright? Where did this come from? How could Jacob suggest such a thing?\\n    While Scripture gives commentaries on Esau\\'s action, it does not explore\\n    the background of this event. It assumes the reader would know all that was\\n    involved, that grandfather Abraham died when the twins were 15 years old\\n    and would have told them again and again about God\\'s appearances to him and\\n    the promises those appearances conveyed. Isaac also had similar personal\\n    experiences with God and had witnessed God\\'s visitations to his father\\n    Abraham as well. These stories were also told over and over in family\\n    gatherings. While Rebekah may have kept secret God\\'s words to her before\\n    the birth of the twins, they must have been aware of at least some of the\\n    details of their births and why they were given such unusual names.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Thus, while Scripture does not elaborate, it only seems reasonable that\\n    over the years Jacob and Esau wondered about those stories. Though God\\'s\\n    visitations to his father and grandfather seemed remote, so beyond anything\\n    actually happening in their lives, if there was something to them, Jacob\\n    wanted to be their recipient. Eventually Jacob came to place a measure of\\n    faith in them and decided to watch for an opportunity to gain the\\n    birthright. Then suddenly the opportunity came. Esau was famished and\\n    wanted something Jacob had. Jacob made the offer and maybe to his amazement\\n    the possessor of the birthright agreed saying \"I am about to die; of what\\n    use is a birthright to me?\" (Genesis 25:31).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Just what was the birthright at this time? It is worth hearing from a\\n    leading Hebrew commentator:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>\\n        The birthright consisted afterward in a double portion of the father\\'s\\n        inheritance (Deuteronomy 21:17); but with the Patriarchs it embraced\\n        the chieftainship, rule over the brethren and the entire family\\n        (Genesis 27:29) and the title to the blessing of promise (Genesis 27:4,\\n        27-29), which included the future possession of Canaan and of covenant\\n        fellowship with Jehovah (Genesis 28:4).\\n    </strong>\\n    <a href=\"#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\" title=\"\">[2]</a>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Possessing this birthright conveying all God promised to Abraham and Isaac;\\n    it was the deed to these promises, but it required faith in the true God.\\n    Scripture pronounces harsh judgment on Esau\\'s act. This passage says he\\n    despised his birthright. Hebrews calls him unholy because of selling his\\n    birthright for a mere meal (Hebrews 12:16). Malachi 1:3 gives an overall\\n    divine assessment: \"I have loved Jacob, but Esau, I have hated\" (Malachi\\n    1:3). Henry Morris concurs in these assessments:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>\\n        It is remarkable that so many Christians are quick to defend Esau and\\n        rebuke Jacob [trading a meal for the birthright], when God has done\\n        neither. Esau was a profane fornicator, with no redeeming qualities\\n        whatsoever, caring nothing about the spiritual significance and\\n        responsibilities of the patriarchal birthright, until he thought that\\n        its loss might diminish his inherited wealth.\\n    </strong>\\n    <a href=\"#_ftn3\" name=\"_ftnref3\" title=\"\">[3]</a>\\n    <strong> (Our words in brackets.)</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    After the birthright incident nothing more is said of the boys until the\\n    end of the next chapter of Genesis. There Scripture reports Esau got\\n    married. By way of background, when Isaac turned forty, Abraham found him a\\n    bride-Rebekah, a granddaughter of Abraham\\'s older brother Nahor. Now Esau\\n    was 40, yet his father gave no indication of finding him and Jacob mates.\\n    Possibly Esau became convinced his father would do nothing so according to\\n    the following verse, before the year was out, the man of action, Esau,\\n    married not one but two Canaanite women:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong><sup>34</sup></strong>\\n    <strong>\\n        When Esau was forty years old, he took Judith the daughter of Beeri the\\n        Hittite, and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite, <sup>35</sup>\\n        and they made life bitter for Isaac and Rebekah. Genesis 26:34-35.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    This action brought Canaanite life with all its evil right into Isaac\\'s\\n    household. The two Canaanite women made life bitter for both Rebekah and\\n    Isaac. Jacob, seeing their distress, decided to wait for the right woman.\\n    That wait lasted forty more years. This second report of Esau\\'s actions\\n    conclude how Scripture would have us view Esau at this point in his life,\\n    confirming the characterizations of Genesis 25:34, Hebrews 12:16 and\\n    Malachi 1:3.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The next glimpse of the twins is even more distressing and not without\\n    controversy. When Isaac thought he was dying, he determined to pass on the\\n    blessing of the firstborn to Esau, the twin born first. In view of the\\n    words of God to Rebekah and the direction of Esau\\'s life, Isaac\\'s plan is\\n    unexplainable. Without question he was badly confused. But we know what\\n    happened. Rebekah learned of the plan. She dressed Jacob to impersonate\\n    Esau and Isaac unintentionally gave the blessing to Jacob.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Esau was angry and let it be known that he would kill his brother once his\\n    father died. At that point he would add murder to his list of evils. Jacob\\n    didn\\'t doubt his older brother\\'s word and feared for his life. But sanity\\n    prevailed. Rebekah discussed the situation with Isaac who blessed Jacob and\\n    sent him away to the household of his mother\\'s father in Haran. He must\\n    take a wife from his mother\\'s people. He must not marry a Canaanite woman.\\n    Trusting God he departed on the 500-mile journey with only a staff in his\\n    hand. In this way God preserved the Abrahamic line from the abominations of\\n    the Canaanites.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Only a few nights from home 74-year old Jacob had a dream. In it he saw the\\n    angels of God rushing up and down on a grand staircase as they carried out\\n    God\\'s work on earth. At the top was God Himself. He spoke to Jacob, saying\\n    He was the God of Abraham and Isaac, that He would give this land to Jacob\\n    and his offspring, that his offspring would be like the dust of the earth,\\n    that in Jacob and his offspring all the families of the earth would be\\n    blessed, that He would keep Jacob and return him to this land (Genesis\\n    28:10-15).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Nothing more is said of the journey but no sooner had Jacob reached his\\n    destination than he was taken with Rachel who was \"beautiful in form and\\n    appearance\" (Genesis 29:17). Rachel was the daughter of his mother\\'s\\n    brother. Since her older sister, Leah, was becoming something of an old\\n    maid, Rachel might have been considerably older than a teenager. Jacob\\n    offered to serve seven years for her hand in marriage and Laban agreed to\\n    the offer.\\n</p>\\n<h3 id=\"a-closer-look-at-jacob\">\\n    A Closer Look at Jacob\\n</h3>\\n<p>\\n    Jacob has received much criticism for the actions of his youth. But are\\n    they consistent with God\\'s revelation? What do we learn from Scripture?\\n    First, Jacob\\'s character. Dr. Morris was distressed to find most\\n    commentators characterized Jacob as a crooked man, a heel grabber. While it\\n    cannot be denied he was shrewd, even crafty, he had fine qualities that\\n    need to be laid beside his stealth. Per chance they mitigate and even cast\\n    a different light on the broad judgment that he was basically dishonest.\\n    After all, Rahab told a direct lie but no commentator casts her in the\\n    light of being a liar. David committed adultery but no commentator\\n    characterizes him as basically immoral. Other qualities far outshine\\n    Rahab\\'s lie and David\\'s adultery. As for Jacob, he was professional,\\n    productive, hard-working, likable and God was with him.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Was he basically dishonest? It was his mother who all but ordered him to\\n    impersonate Esau. She had great influence on him. He had even foregone\\n    marriage out of his respect for his parents\\' feelings and judgment. His\\n    father was apparently about to disregard God\\'s will and his mother proposed\\n    a way to avoid that. As to her plan, it certainly was dishonest, but the\\n    tendency toward dishonesty came mostly from her side of the family. Her\\n    brother was as crooked as they come. He changed Jacob\\'s wages countless\\n    times to steal what rightly belonged to Jacob. He gave Jacob Leah after\\n    Jacob had served him seven years for Rachel. So let\\'s dispense with\\n    labeling Jacob \"dishonest.\" Instead see him as Scripture begins to speak\\n    much of him, beginning with his arrival in the region of Haran.\\n</p>\\n<p class=\"verse\">\\n    <strong>\\n        Now as soon as Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother\\'s\\n        brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother\\'s brother, Jacob came near\\n        and rolled the stone from the well\\'s mouth and watered the flock of\\n        Laban his mother\\'s brother. Genesis 29:10.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Notice Jacob\\'s skill with animals. Although he was a complete stranger to\\n    this flock, Rachel\\'s sheep immediately sensed they were in good hands,\\n    allowing him to water them. Jacob also understood the sheep business for he\\n    had previously noted to the other shepherds that it was high noon and the\\n    sheep needed to be grazing, not waiting to be watered. Then, without help,\\n    he removed the cover from the well and watered Rachel\\'s sheep. He was not\\n    bound by incompetent practices which limited the success of shepherding in\\n    that area. This act displayed initiative, independence, strength,\\n    confidence and competence.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    If Jacob acted with professionalism towards this newly encountered flock,\\n    his next action showed a soul filled with deep emotion and expectation. His\\n    skill with the sheep was only exceeded by his way with the shepherdess.\\n</p>\\n<p class=\"verse\">\\n    <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>\\n    <strong>\\n        Then Jacob kissed Rachel and wept aloud. <sup>12</sup>And Jacob told\\n        Rachel that he was her father\\'s kinsman, and he was Rebekah\\'s son, and\\n        she ran and told her father. Genesis 29:11-12.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The kiss: Maybe tender and on the cheek, but arising from deep emotion.\\n    This 74-year-old man bawled aloud. Just as Abraham\\'s servant had found his\\n    mother immediately upon his arrival 94 years before, Jacob no more arrived\\n    than he stumbled on what he must have hoped would be his life\\'s partner.\\n    Both events happened somewhere near Haran. She was the right fit-his\\n    mother\\'s niece, his own cousin whom he had never met and probably did not\\n    know existed, beautiful, enterprising, engaging and receiving. What a\\n    reward after forsaking his home of 74 years and making a perilous, lonely,\\n    500-mile journey. The girl\\'s father invited Jacob to stay with them.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The next verses tell us Jacob was smart and industrious. Rather than\\n    spending all of his time with Rachel, he immediately set out to impress her\\n    father with his work ethic and he succeeded. A month later Laban\\n    uncharacteristically began the following conversation:\\n</p>\\n<p class=\"verse\">\\n    <strong>\\n        Because you are my kinsman, should you therefore serve me for nothing?\\n        Tell me, what shall your wages be? Genesis 29:15.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Wages? Here was Jacob\\'s opportunity. Jacob wanted Rachel. He had no money\\n    for a dowry but he could work. He made an offer of service for this\\n    daughter of Laban. He would serve Laban seven years for Rachel and then she\\n    would be his. Next we read:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>\\n    <strong>\\n        So Jacob served seven years for Rachel, and they seemed to him but a\\n        few days because of the love he had for her. <sup>21</sup>Then Jacob\\n        said to Laban, \"Give me my wife that I may go in to her, for my time is\\n        completed.\" Genesis 29:20-21.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    What love it had been that seven years would seem like a few days. Then\\n    Jacob went to Laban and asked for Rachel so he could \"go in to her.\" The\\n    reason he was asking was that he had completed his seven years of service\\n    for her. \"Going in to her\" is a euphemism for marital intimacy. In effect\\n    Jacob was saying that he had not violated Rachel\\'s virginity even though he\\n    had been with Laban seven years.\\n</p>\\n<h3 id=\"jacob-marries-the-wrong-woman\">\\n    Jacob Marries the Wrong Woman\\n</h3>\\n<p>\\n    Next Scripture reports on the wedding celebration:\\n</p>\\n<p class=\"verse\">\\n    <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>\\n    <strong>\\n        So Laban gathered together all the people of the place and made a\\n        feast. <sup>23</sup>But in the evening he took his daughter Leah and\\n        brought her to Jacob, and he went in to her. <sup>25</sup>And in the\\n        morning behold, it was Leah! And Jacob said to Laban, What is this you\\n        have done to me? Did I not serve with you for Rachel? Why then have you\\n        deceived me?\" <sup>26</sup>Laban said, \"It is not so done in our\\n        country, to give the younger before the firstborn.\" Genesis 29:22-23,\\n        25-26.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The passage does not say how Laban switched daughters but it clearly states\\n    he successfully did. In the morning Jacob was outraged and accused Laban of\\n    deception. He said, \"What is this you have done to me? Did I not serve with\\n    you for Rachel?\" Why then have you deceived me? (Genesis 29:25). Clearly\\n    Jacob had fulfilled his end of the bargain. He had served seven years for\\n    Rachel. Laban affirmed it by explaining a previously unmentioned custom,\\n    that the oldest daughter had to be married first.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <h4 id=\"the-traditional-approach\">\\n        The Traditional Approach: Marriage before the Years of Service\\n    </h4>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Astonishingly, the leading advocate of the 215-year approach, Archbishop\\n    James Ussher as well as others to this day say this wedding celebration\\n    took place before Jacob had served any of the 14 years. In complete\\n    disregard to the words of the Bible Ussher offers the following chronology:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>1759 BC - Jacob flees from Esau to Haran</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>1758 BC - Leah bears Reuben</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>1757 BC - Leah bears Simeon</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>1756 BC - Leah bears Levi</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>1755 BC - Leah bears Judah</strong>\\n    <a href=\"#_ftn4\" name=\"_ftnref4\" title=\"\">[4]</a>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Ussher\\'s chronology above shows Jacob to have fathered his firstborn the\\n    year following his arrival in Haran. Since Leah was the mother, by\\n    implication both daughters became wives of Jacob at the beginning of his\\n    20-year stay with Laban. Ussher\\'s dates show he believed Leah\\'s first four\\n    sons were born just one year apart beginning one year after Jacob\\'s arrival\\n    in Haran. Why would he and those holding the 215-year view to this day\\n    contradict the clear words of Scripture? The following three reasons are\\n    offered; this chapter shows that each was unsound.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    1. Scripture relates a sequence of births one after another, not several at\\n    the same time.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    2. All the children were born by the time Jacob had been with Laban 14\\n    years because of the six year work contract\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    3. The children had to be several years older than they would be if he\\n    worked seven years before receiving his bride(s) because of later events in\\n    the life of Jacob.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <h4 id=\"confirming-marriage-to-leah\">Confirming Marriage to Leah; Serving for Rachel</h4>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Back to our story. Laban had a solution:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>\\n    <strong>\\n        [Laban said] \"Complete the week of this one [Leah], and we will give\\n        you the other [Rachel] also in return for serving me another seven\\n        years.\" <sup>28</sup>Jacob did so, and completed her [Leah\\'s] week [of\\n        wedding celebration]. Then Laban gave him his daughter Rachel to be his\\n        wife. Genesis 29:27-28. (Our words in brackets.)\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Laban\\'s solution was that Jacob could have Rachel as well as Leah for seven\\n    more years of service. He only asked that Jacob fulfill the week of wedding\\n    celebration with Leah and then he would give Jacob Rachel as well. The\\n    solution seemed straight forward. Jacob was to complete the very public\\n    marriage celebration to the older sister. There would be no doubt in\\n    anyone\\'s mind that he was married to her. After the festivities he would be\\n    given the younger sister as well and then serve Laban seven more years for\\n    the second wife.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    This new offer meant Jacob would continue to celebrate his marriage to Leah\\n    for the remaining six days-no public scene denouncing Laban as a deceiver,\\n    no cold shoulder to Leah; rather, pleasant, cheerful, celebrating. Jacob\\n    had not planned to be a bigamist. Both his father and grandfather were\\n    one-woman type of men. For seven years thoughts about Rachel had helped him\\n    through each exhausting day. Her presence lit up his life. He had no\\n    interest in any other woman.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Jacob was over a barrel. He wanted Rachel with all his heart. He would do\\n    almost anything for her. Further he was a decent man and didn\\'t want to\\n    denounce Leah. Wittingly or not, he had spent the night with her. Who would\\n    want her now? He was undoubtedly angry and probably confused and he didn\\'t\\n    have the luxury of time to think it over. Scripture records his decision\\n    and Laban\\'s response: \"Jacob did so and completed her week. Then Laban gave\\n    him his daughter Rachel to be his wife\" (Genesis 29:28). So Jacob said\\n    \"uncle\" and soon had twice as many wives as he ever intended. Nine months\\n    later Leah gave Jacob his first son, sealing her status as his wife.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Laban\\'s plan was a complete success. His older daughter who had attracted\\n    no successful suitor was very publicly wedded to Jacob. Laban\\'s honor was\\n    intact. He would have no old maid daughter languishing in his house. Most\\n    likely at least his household knew what he had done but woe to the person\\n    who questioned his actions. Thus was the power of the family patriarch in\\n    his day.\\n</p>\\n<h3 id=\"problem-of-the-sequence\">\\n    Problem of the Sequence of Children\\'s Births\\n</h3>\\n<p>\\n    The genealogists say the Scripture tells the sequence of the children\\'s\\n    births. This sequence requires approximately fourteen years. The only way\\n    to find that much time is for Laban to have given his two daughters to\\n    Jacob at the beginning of Jacob\\'s 20 year stay. We suggest that on\\n    occasion, Scripture groups similar events and thoughts before going back\\n    over the same time frame to report other events and thoughts. The following\\n    are examples of Scriptural grouping:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Esau\\'s genealogy is inserted between the death of Isaac and Joseph\\'s story.\\n    Genesis 35 ends with the death of Isaac. Genesis 36 chronicles 500 years of\\n    Jacob\\'s twin brother\\'s line. Genesis 37:1 actually backtracks to events\\n    before Isaac\\'s death. Thus 500 years of Edomite history are inserted in the\\n    middle of the Jacob/Joseph narrative.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Genesis 2:5 returns to day six of creation week after Genesis 1:1-2:3\\n    reports the full seven days. The sons of Japheth are listed in Genesis\\n    10:2-5, then the descendants of Ham (10:6-20) and finally the descendants\\n    of Shem (10:21-31). No one would dispute that division of history, but\\n    Genesis 10 would be very confusing if it reported each birth as it\\n    happened. Genesis 11:27-32 reports the record of Terah before taking up\\n    God\\'s dealing with Abraham which reaches back to his call in Ur (Genesis\\n    12-24) 10 or 15 years before. Genesis 35:28-29 reports the death of Isaac\\n    even though it happened 13 (or was it 12 years? I must research.) years\\n    after the selling of Joseph in Genesis 37.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Similarly, we believe that because several mothers were expecting at the\\n    same time and therefore births overlapped, the writer chose to group the\\n    births of Jacob\\'s children: Leah\\'s first four, then Bilhah\\'s two, then\\n    Zilpah\\'s two, then Leah\\'s final three and lastly Rachel\\'s son. Because of\\n    overlapping pregnancies, twelve children were born in just 10 years.\\n</p>\\n<h3 id=\"twelve-births-in-ten-years\">\\n    Twelve Births in Ten Years\\n</h3>\\n<p>\\n    Over the next ten years Jacob fathered eleven sons plus a daughter. But the\\n    other side can only see seven years available for these 12 children if\\n    Jacob served seven years before he received two wives and then six years\\n    for the cattle. Thus they manipulate Scripture to make more time. We will\\n    see that ten years were available and that ten years was sufficient. But\\n    first, we must acknowledge that this was the work of God. The odds of\\n    having eleven sons in a row are enormous. God was behind all this and the\\n    goal was our salvation, Jesus Christ, Jacob\\'s ultimate seed and the defeat\\n    of Satan. Scripture does not tell us all the details of the scenario God\\n    used. Because some insist it was impossible, we suggest one scenario that\\n    is entirely consistent with Scripture. While the following is speculative,\\n    it honors Scripture.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    When the week of celebrating Jacob\\'s marriage to Leah was over, Laban\\n    quietly gave Jacob his younger daughter as well. Jacob immediately\\n    transferred to Rachel\\'s bedroom and spent nearly all of his time there for\\n    the next 13 years. At first possibly this was a family secret but in time\\n    it simply became accepted as the way things were. This transfer of bedrooms\\n    is apparent from the names Leah chose for her six boys and the mandrake\\n    event. She called her firstborn Reuben \"Because,\" she said, \"the LORD has\\n    looked upon my affliction; for now my husband will love me.\" (Genesis\\n    29:32). How was she afflicted? How was she unloved? Her husband paid her no\\n    attention. He spent his nights in Rachel\\'s tent. Score: Leah-1; Rachel-0.\\n    Elapsed time: 9 months since the marriage.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Jacob knew about conception. Animal breeding was his life. To say he was a\\n    successful animal breeder would be an understatement. He became wealthy\\n    through his breeding skills. In the next few years Jacob discovered that\\n    Leah was a virtual baby machine, and sons at that! Leah would deliver a son\\n    and six months later she would conceive again-spacing boys about 15 months\\n    apart. Rachel had not conceived in nine months while Leah conceived that\\n    very first week. So about 6 months after Leah\\'s first delivery, Jacob began\\n    visiting her bedroom until she became pregnant again. But then he went back\\n    to Rachel. Scripture tells us as much. Leah named her second son Simeon\\n    \"Because the LORD has heard that I am hated.\" (Genesis 29:33). Hated? Yes.\\n    Her husband spent his nights with Rachel, not with Leah. Score: Leah-2;\\n    Rachel-0. Elapsed time: 24 months since the marriage (9+6+9=24).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    About 6 months after Leah\\'s second delivery, Jacob returned and soon she\\n    was expecting a third time. A total of 30 months had elapsed (9+6+9+6=30).\\n    This may have been when a new development unfolded. Rachel engaged Jacob in\\n    a heated argument. She demanded he make her pregnant. He said he was not\\n    God. Well, if he couldn\\'t make her pregnant, he must give her a child by\\n    her handmaid, Bilhah. Jacob must have thought, \"Is a third wife the price\\n    of peace?\" With that, Bilhah conceived and behold, another boy. This son\\n    was born shortly after Leah\\'s third.

So\\n    fifty-four months after her marriage, Leah mothered a fourth son\\n    (9+15+15+15=54) while Bilhah delivered her second son three months later.\\n    For the first time Leah did not complain about her husband\\'s absence.\\n    Instead she said, \"This time I will praise the Lord.\" (Genesis 29:35).\\n    Score: Leah-4; Rachel-2; Elapsed time since Jacob\\'s marriage: 57 months\\n    (54+3=57). Jacob now has six sons in just four and three-quarter years.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    When Leah didn\\'t get pregnant as she usually did about six months after the\\n    birth of her fourth son, she became uneasy. Maybe Bilhah became pregnant\\n    for a third time which would later prove to be a girl, but Leah would not\\n    know it at the time. Leah must have fretted, \"Rachel is catching up! I must\\n    do something. Rachel enlisted her handmaid. I\\'ll do the same with my\\n    handmaid Zilpah.\" As to Laban\\'s thoughts on the matter, he was already\\n    bragging to his men friends: \"You hear? Six grandsons in less than five\\n    years. Isn\\'t that a record?\"\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    At the same time Jacob may have been thinking, \"God, you said, \\'Your\\n    offspring shall be like the dust of the earth, and you shall spread abroad\\n    to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south, and in you\\n    and your offspring shall all the families of the earth be blessed.\\'\\n    (Genesis 28:14). God, I had no idea, but if this is how, so be it.\" So when\\n    Leah offered her handmaid, Jacob went for broke. Nine months later Zilpah\\n    delivered a son.

Rachel asked Leah\\n    for some. Apparently Jacob had given up on Rachel conceiving even though he\\n    still shared her bed. As for Leah, Jacob hadn\\'t come to her tent for nearly\\n    a year and a half (the last time was six months after the birth of her\\n    fourth son when she did not conceive). Leah struck the following bargain:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>\\n    <strong>\\n        But she [Leah] said to her, \"Is it a small matter that you have taken\\n        away my husband? Would you take away my son\\'s mandrakes also?\" Rachel\\n        said, \"Then he may lie with you tonight in exchange for your son\\'s\\n        mandrakes.\" <sup>16</sup>When Jacob came from the field in the evening,\\n        Leah went out to meet him and said, \"You must come in to me, for I have\\nhired you with my son\\'s mandrakes.\" So he lay with her that night.        <sup>17</sup>And God listened to Leah, and she conceived and bore Jacob\\n        a fifth son. Genesis 30:15-17.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Here we read that Leah had to hire her husband for a single night some\\n    seven years and four sons after they were married! Clearly, Jacob did not\\n    divide his time between Leah and Rachel. Leah who hoped for the attention\\n    of her husband came to derive happiness from her sons and from the Lord who\\n    answered her prayer for a fifth son. Maybe Jacob was still blind to her\\n    worth, but who cared when the hugs of little boys never ceased, and\\n    grandfather Laban swelled with pride.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Note that Scripture does not indicate that Leah\\'s fifth pregnancy followed\\n    Zilpah\\'s second pregnancy. Rather, Scripture groups Zilpah\\'s two\\n    pregnancies together just as it grouped Bilhah\\'s two pregnancies together.\\n    We suggest that Leah rested for two years after the birth of Judah and then\\n    became pregnant for the fifth time when Jacob visited her tent for a single\\n    night six and a half years after their marriage. Fifteen months later Jacob\\n    visited again and Leah became pregnant with her sixth son. Fifteen months\\n    later Jacob visited again and Leah became pregnant with her first daughter.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    To summarize, Rachel\\'s handmaid carried sons during Leah\\'s 3<sup>rd</sup>\\n    and 4<sup>th</sup> pregnancies while Leah\\'s handmaid carried pregnancies\\n    towards the end of Leah\\'s 24 month resting period and again during her\\n    fifth pregnancy. Rachel delivered Joseph shortly before Leah\\'s first\\n    daughter was born, maybe three months before. By this scenario, the total\\n    time involved from Jacob\\'s week-long marriage celebration to Leah to the\\nbirth of Dinah was 117 months (9+3*15+24+9+2*15=117)    <a href=\"#_ftn5\" name=\"_ftnref5\" title=\"\">[5]</a>. 117 months is nine years\\n    and nine months. Final score: eight sons and one daughter for Leah\\'s team;\\n    three sons and an unreported number of daughters for Rachel\\'s team.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Rachel also learned to look to God rather than Jacob during this time:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>\\n    <strong>\\nThen God remembered Rachel and God listened to her and opened her womb.        <sup>23</sup>She conceived and bore a son and said, \"God has taken away\\n        my reproach.\" <sup>24</sup>And she called his name Joseph, saying, \"May\\n        the LORD add to me another son!\" Genesis 30:22-24.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The paragraph before the birth of Joseph concludes with \"Afterward she\\n    (Leah) bore a daughter and called her name Dinah.\" (Genesis 30:21). The\\n    writer grouped Leah\\'s last three births together, but indicated that\\n    Joseph\\'s birth came before Dinah\\'s birth. In this way all of the children\\n    were born within the birthing years of Leah. This is not the only scenario\\n    that could be devised, but whichever one it was, Scripture says it was\\n    successful. Who is man to change what God said happened?\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The scenario we use places Joseph\\'s birth at 114 months (9.5 years) after\\n    Jacob received his two wives. When Joseph was born is the key to the age of\\n    Jacob and his children. He was 130 when he appeared before Pharaoh (Genesis\\n    47:9) and Joseph was 39. [Joseph was elevated at the age of 30 (Genesis\\n    41:46) officiated over seven years of plenty and two years of famine when\\n    he stood with his father before pharaoh (30+7+2=39)]. Therefore, Joseph was\\n    born when Jacob was 91 (130-39=91). We suggest that about three and a half\\n    years later Jacob returned to Canaan and was 94.5 years old. Thus he\\n    arrived in Haran at the age of 74 and was married at the age of 81\\n    (74+7=81). Since Scripture doesn\\'t work with fractions of a year, we need\\n    to work with the whole number of departing Haran at the age of 94.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    In summary, this is our view: Jacob served Laban seven years, then married\\n    Leah and Rachel and fathered twelve children in the next ten years. Sadly,\\n    the numbers-over-words approach is that more years were needed and\\n    concluded Laban gave his two daughters to Jacob shortly after he first\\narrived. Thus by silence in the case of Ussher in    <em>The Annals of the World</em>, and through explaining Scripture away in\\n    the case of his modern counterparts, inerrancy is violated. Where is faith\\n    in all this? Inerrancy requires us to accept what God has clearly said, not\\n    follow our own reasoning. Unfortunately, the inerrancy view continues to be\\n    rejected to this day.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    However, first an observation is in order. Early Bible history emphasizes\\n    sons. The genealogies from Adam to Noah and from Seth to Abraham are\\n    records of sons begetting sons. Some fathers had multiple wives. No lines\\n    are recorded in terms of daughters begetting daughters; wives having\\n    multiple husbands is likewise unrecorded. When Jacob fled Laban, Genesis\\n    31:17 reports, \"So Jacob arose and set his sons and his wives on camels.\"\\n    Yet when Jacob moved his people to Egypt, Genesis 46:5-7 says, \"Then Jacob\\n    set out from Beersheba... and came into Egypt, Jacob and all his offspring\\n    with him, his sons and his sons\\' sons, his daughters, and his sons\\'\\n    daughters&#8230;.\"\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    \"Daughters\" is plural, yet only Dinah is said to have been born to him in\\n    all his years. Because of the emphasis on \"sons,\" it is possible that the\\n    handmaids of Leah and Rachel bore unnamed daughters to Jacob either before\\n    or after he left Haran. Since the Scripture is silent about when one or\\n    more other daughters were born to Jacob, we need to be aware that possibly\\n    during the birth of the eleven sons in Haran, one or more other daughters\\n    were also born to him. We make this point because sometimes interpreters\\n    state dogmatically what Scripture does not actually say. In honoring the\\n    principle of inerrancy, we must diligently stand where Scripture stands and\\n    be tentative where Scripture is silent. This principle will become\\n    particularly important as we look at individual genealogies in the next two\\n    chapters.\\n</p>\\n<h3 id=\"problem-of-the-timing-of-jacobs-contract\">\\n    Problem of the Timing of Jacob\\'s Contract\\n</h3>\\n<p>\\n    Secondly, the 215-year people say Jacob\\'s wages supports their view, with\\n    the following line of thinking. Jacob requested being sent away as soon as\\n    his eleventh son, Joseph, was born. Laban urged Jacob to stay with him and\\n    offered to let him name his wages. Since Jacob later said he served 14\\n    years for Laban\\'s two daughters and six years for Laban\\'s flock, the\\n    standard approach jumps to the conclusion that this request and Joseph\\'s\\n    birth occurred 14 years after Jacob joined Laban and six years before he\\n    departed from Laban. We will show that there were multiple wage contracts\\n    and clearly, this was not the one that began the final six years, thus\\n    invalidating their argument.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The relevant Scripture is found in Genesis 30-31:\\n</p>\\n<p class=\"verse\">\\n    <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>\\n    <strong>\\n        As soon as Rachel had borne Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, \"Send me away,\\n        that I may go to my own home and country. <sup>26</sup>Give me my wives\\n        and my children for whom I have served you, that I may go, for you know\\n        the service that I have given you. <sup>27</sup>But Laban said to him,\\n        \"[stay with me] &#8230;. <sup>28</sup>Name your wages&#8230;\" Genesis\\n        30:25-28.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p class=\"verse\">\\n    <strong>\\n        [Jacob said] \"These twenty years I have been in your house. I served\\n        you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your\\n        flock, and you have changed my wages ten times.\" Genesis 31:41.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    While their logic seems plausible, nowhere does Scripture say Joseph was\\n    born at the end of the fourteen years. Neither does it say that this labor\\n    contract began the six years for the flock. But it does quote Jacob twice\\n    saying that Laban changed his wages ten times (to his wives in 31:7 and to\\n    Laban in 31:41). Eleven contracts? Once a search is made for evidence of\\n    changed wages and Jacob\\'s claim is justified, we will realize that Ussher\\n    and followers commit the logical fallacies of jumping to conclusions and\\n    arguing from silence. So, when was the first agreement made? The last? And\\n    what about the one that is recorded?\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    We suggest that various informal arrangements were made and then broken by\\n    Laban before the most important one, the one that is recorded. Some were\\n    made even before the fourteen years were completed. This is suggested by\\n    Jacob\\'s later angry response to Laban:\\n</p>\\n<p class=\"verse\">\\n    <strong><sup>38</sup></strong>\\n    <strong>\\n        These twenty years I have been with you. Your ewes and your female\\n        goats have not miscarried, and I have not eaten the rams of your\\n        flocks. <sup>39</sup>What was torn by wild beasts I did not bring to\\n        you. I bore the loss of it myself. From my hand you required it,\\n        whether stolen by day or stolen by night. <sup>40</sup>There I was: by\\n        day the heat consumed me, and the cold by night, and my sleep fled from\\n        my eyes. Genesis 31:38-40.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    How could Jacob bear the loss? How could it be required of his hand if he\\n    had no sheep or goats of his own to pay with before those final six years?\\n    Females were kept to multiply the flock while males were eaten, but Jacob,\\n    in spite of having a growing household, ate none of Laban\\'s goats. Only if\\n    Laban paid Jacob with animals or allowed Jacob to begin building a flock of\\n    his own during those fourteen years could he feed his family and repay\\n    Laban for animals that had been torn or stolen.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    At the fourteen year mile stone a more formal arrangement was made so he\\n    could begin to acquire camels and cows as well as flocks. While Scripture\\n    does not record this agreement, it alludes to such an arrangement with the\\n    words about serving six years for the flocks. But when Laban saw Jacob\\n    truly prospering, he would have repeated his practice of changing Jacob\\'s\\n    wages time and again.\\n</p>\\n<h4 id=\"wage-agreement-reported-in-scripture\">\\n    Wage Agreement Reported in Scripture\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\n    Finally when Joseph was born, Jacob became very assertive and said \"Send me\\n    away.\" This time Laban, fearing he was about to lose Jacob, let Jacob name\\n    his wages and Jacob stayed on. This is the wage arrangement reported in\\n    Genesis 30: 25-28. It happened just after the birth of Joseph. Dinah was\\n    born several months later. If the final six years were a rounded number and\\n    the actual duration were six years and three months, Jacob would have left\\n    Laban three and a half years after Dinah\\'s birth (according to our proposed\\n    scenario). When Jacob did leave, he left with an enormous number of\\n    healthy, young animals. Jacob\\'s practices did not produce this bounty. It\\n    came from God who provided both his enormous herds and his sons.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Why was Laban desperate to retain Jacob\\'s services? He himself said, \"The\\n    LORD has blessed me because of you\" (30:27). Jacob states this even more\\n    strongly: \"For you had little before I came, and it has increased\\n    abundantly, and the LORD has blessed you wherever I turned\" (30:30).\\n    Jacob\\'s service increased Laban\\'s wealth from \"little\" to \"abundant.\"\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    This recorded agreement was to begin by Jacob passing through all Laban\\'s\\n    flock and removing \"every speckled, and spotted sheep and every black lamb,\\n    and the spotted and speckled among the goats\" (Genesis 30:32) for himself.\\n    What actually happened? Somehow Laban distracted Jacob or took advantage of\\n    Jacob\\'s work schedule and while Jacob was busy with other things, Laban\\n    with his sons rushed out and removed all such sheep and goats and sent them\\n    far away with his sons so Jacob would never get any of them back. Laban\\n    violated that contract before the ink was dry.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    On average sheep produce lambs once a year although they can bear in both\\n    the spring and fall. Three years is about the minimum time to replace most\\n    of Laban\\'s black and white animals with striped and spotted animals by\\n    normal births, but with the hand of God guiding the genetics the process\\n    was miraculously shrunk into the available time.\\n</p>\\n<h4 id=\"god-overrules-labans-wage-changes\">\\n    God Overrules Laban\\'s Wage Changes\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\n    Jacob tells Rachel and Leah about two other changes to his wages after the\\n    agreement recorded in Scripture: \"If he (Laban) said, \\'The spotted shall be\\n    your wages,\\' then all the flock bore spotted\" (31:8). In other words, when\\n    Laban saw that all (or most of) of the kids were striped, mottled or\\n    spotted which he originally said would be Jacob\\'s wages, he reneged,\\n    limiting Jacob\\'s wages to just those with spots. Jacob continued: \"if he\\n    said, \\'The striped shall be your wages\\', then all the flock bore striped.\"\\n    In other words, when Laban saw all the kids were spotted, he changed the\\n    wages to those kids with stripes and the next time around, all the kids\\n    were striped. Every time Laban changed Jacob\\'s wages, the flocks bred in\\n    Jacob\\'s favor! Jacob realized that God was doing this: \"But God did not\\n    permit him to harm me\" (31:7). God was overruling Laban\\'s changes. \"Thus\"\\n    (Jacob concluded) \"God has taken away the livestock of your father and\\n    given them to me.\" (31:8-9).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Even more evidence for the wage changing game comes in the form of a dream\\n    God gave Jacob. He told Rachel and Leah, \"The angel of God said to me in\\n    the dream, \\'Jacob,\\' and I said, \\'Here I am!\\' And he said, \\'Lift up your\\n    eyes and see, all the goats that mate with the flock are striped, spotted,\\n    and mottled, for I have seen all that Laban is doing to you\\'\" (31:11-12).\\n    What was God\\'s point? In the field all mating goats that were not\\n    completely black had been removed and set aside. But in the dream, all the\\n    remaining mating goats, the ones belonging to Laban, were also\\n    multicolored, thus insuring their kids would be multicolored and thus\\n    belong to Jacob. Jacob would understand the same thing to be true of the\\n    flocks of sheep.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Laban should have known that he couldn\\'t cheat God. God would simply have\\n    all the kids and lambs marked with Laban\\'s most recent wage change. When\\n    Jacob told Rachel and Leah his dream, they agreed with Jacob that they\\n    should move to Canaan, concluding that their father was cheating them out\\n    of what was rightfully theirs:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>\\n    <strong>\\nIs there any portion or inheritance left to us in our father\\'s house?        <sup>15</sup>Are we not regarded by him as foreigners? For he has sold\\n        us, and he has indeed devoured our money. <sup>16</sup>All the wealth\\n        that God has taken away from our father belongs to us and to our\\n        children. Genesis 31:14-16.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<h3 id=\"time-for-jacob-to-leave\">\\n    Time for Jacob to Leave\\n</h3>\\n<p>\\n    Sheep were sheared before the hot summer but after spring lambing. It could\\n    be this master contract was negotiated before spring birthing and shearing,\\n    allowing Jacob to accumulate his animals over four birthing seasons, even\\n    though only 3 &#189; years passed. Thus when he left, most of his oldest\\n    animals were just over three years old and the youngest had been born\\n    within the previous three months.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Maybe this is why Laban removed the multicolored animals for himself once\\n    he realized that the animals had already mated the previous fall. The\\n    possibility of four birthing seasons would answer any who might maintain\\n    that Laban\\'s flocks couldn\\'t be transferred to Jacob in just three birthing\\n    seasons. As previously pointed out, the six years and twenty years are\\n    round numbers. The six years could be 6 &#188; years. The twenty years\\n    could be 20 &#188; years. Leah\\'s daughter could have been born 9 &#190;\\n    years after Jacob received his wives. These number would provide 3 &#189;\\n    years from this master contract until Jacob departed. In that case it could\\n    have involved four mating seasons and four birthing seasons.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    As God increased Jacob\\'s wealth, Jacob heard that the sons of Laban were\\n    saying, \"Jacob has taken all that was our father\\'s\" (Genesis 31:1).\\n    Further, Jacob saw \"that Laban did not regard him with favor as before\"\\n    (Genesis 31:2). An alarming number of Laban\\'s animals had become Jacob\\'s.\\n    He was no longer their workhorse, multiplying their wealth. Jacob\\n    attributed the deed to God: \"God has taken away the livestock of your\\n    father and given them to me\" (Genesis 31:9). But jealousy was replacing\\n    their approval of Jacob. Jealousy can be deadly. Jacob was in danger. At\\n    this point God told Jacob to return to his homeland (Genesis 31:3).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    But how could he leave? For twenty years Jacob had seen Laban\\'s\\n    highhandedness. He believed Laban would never let him return to Canaan with\\n    his family and wealth. Both he and Laban said as much. Laban later said,\\n    \"You have driven away my daughters like captives&#8230;\" Laban called\\n    Jacob\\'s children \"my sons and my daughters...\" (Genesis 31:26, 28). They\\n    didn\\'t belong to Jacob, they belonged to him and as head of the household,\\n    he intended to keep what was his. Further, he would threaten, \"It is in my\\n    power to do you harm\" (Genesis 31:29). Jacob would reply, \"If the God of my\\n    father, the God of Abraham and the Fear of Isaac, had not been on my side,\\n    surely now you would have sent me away empty-handed\" (Genesis 31:42). This\\n    was the power of the patriarch. Laban could allow Jacob to go out with his\\n    family and wealth or let him leave empty-handed. Jacob had no choice but to\\n    flee secretly. Laban pursued and overtook Jacob. God intervened. Jacob was\\n    able to keep his family and newly formed wealth.\\n</p>\\n<h4 id=\"counting-jacobs-wealth\">\\n    Counting Jacob\\'s Wealth\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\n    How much had God given Jacob? How many animals did Jacob have to move?\\n    Genesis 30:43 reports that Jacob \"increased greatly and had large flocks,\\n    female servants and male servants, and camels and donkeys.\" In Genesis 32:5\\n    he sent the following word to Esau: \"I have oxen, donkeys, flocks, male\\n    servants and female servants.\" He gave the following present to his brother\\n    Esau:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>\\n    <strong>\\n        two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and\\n        twenty rams, <sup>15</sup>thirty milking camels and their calves, forty\\n        cows and ten bulls, twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys. Genesis\\n        32:14-15.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Jacob\\'s gift amounted to 550 animals plus calves. At Bethel he promised God\\n    a tenth if God returned him (Genesis 28:22-22). If this was that tenth, he\\n    possessed over 5000 animals-which was nearly half as many animals as Job\\n    had before Satan\\'s attack-most of Jacob\\'s acquired in just six years!\\n    Indeed, only God could have provided such increase.\\n</p>\\n<h3 id=\"jacobs-escape\">\\n    Jacob\\'s Escape: How Do the Numbers Work Out?\\n</h3>\\n<p>\\n    Multiplying Jacob\\'s livestock was one thing. Returning them to the home of\\n    his father was another. How did Jacob do it? Here is a possible scenario:\\n    Jacob\\'s nursing flocks could cover ten miles at most in a day without\\n    injury. It was about 500 land miles to his father in Hebron and almost 400\\n    miles to the hill country of Gilead where Jacob thought he might be safe.\\n    Yet it was there that Laban and his kinsmen overtook Jacob. How could Jacob\\n    have gotten so far in such a short time? Or did he have more time?\\n    Scripture sometimes summarizes an event that involved much more than is\\n    stated as we shall shortly see.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    But first, Jacob\\'s escape and Laban\\'s pursuit:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>\\n    <strong>\\n        So Jacob arose and set his sons and his wives on camels. <sup>18</sup>\\n        He drove away all his livestock, all his property that he had gained,\\n        the livestock in his possession that he had acquired in Paddan-aram, to\\n        go to the land of Canaan to his father Isaac.... <sup>21</sup>He fled\\n        with all that he had and arose and crossed the Euphrates, and set his\\n        face toward the hill country of Gilead. <sup>22</sup>When it was told\\n        Laban on the third day that Jacob had fled, <sup>23</sup>He took his\\n        kinsmen with him and pursued him [Jacob] for seven days and followed\\n        close after him into the hill country of Gilead. Genesis 31:17-18,\\n        21-23.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Three critical details are disclosed in these verses. First, he had camels\\n    for transportation which meant great speed. Second, he had to cross the\\n    Euphrates which was the major barrier between Haran and Hebron. Third, his\\n    goal was to reach the hill country of Gilead.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <h4 id=\"the-route-to-home\">The Route to Home</h4>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The standard trade route from Haran to Egypt involved crossing the\\n    Euphrates river at the last down river place it could be forded on foot-the\\n    ancient city of Carchemish, 65 miles due west of Haran. From the story of\\n    Joseph being sold by his brothers, we learn that shepherds took their\\n    flocks many miles to find pasture. Jacob would surely have located his\\n    flocks in the direction of the escape route. From Carchemish the trade\\n    route went southwest for 80 miles to Aleppo and then south another 35 to\\n    Ebla. The trade route continued directly south for another 170 miles to\\n    Damascus. Seventy-five miles beyond Damascus one reached the hill country\\n    of Gilead which was directly east of the Sea of Galilee in the Jordan Rift\\n    Valley.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    However, determining specifics are difficult since at least three unknowns\\n    are involved in Jacob\\'s return home. First, we only know the general area\\n    of Laban\\'s ranch-Paddan-aram and Haran. Paddan-aram was a region while\\n    Haran was the major supply center on the trade route. The ranch could have\\n    been 20-30 miles from Haran. Second, we do not know for sure that Jacob\\n    crossed at the common fording of Carchemish. While that was the normal\\n    fording point a millennium later, the river could have changed much between\\n    Jacob\\'s day and when better records were kept later. Third, we do not know\\n    where along the hills of Gilead Laban finally overtook Jacob. Four hundred\\n    years later that area was given to two and a half of the twelve tribes. At\\n    that time it was generally to the east of the Sea of Galilee. But it is\\n    possible that in Jacob\\'s day the area nominally extended north for a\\n    distance. Thus our best effort is an estimated 400 miles from Laban\\'s ranch\\n    to the point where he overtook Jacob.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    When God told Jacob to return home He added, \"I will be with you\" (Genesis\\n    31:3). Jacob would have divine protection. Nevertheless, Jacob had to plan\\n    his escape carefully. He waited until Laban would be shearing his sheep\\n    several days journey away from the ranch. He sent for his wives (possibly\\n    as Laban was setting out) to join him for a secret meeting in the fields.\\n    Laban\\'s household must not know. Jacob made his case for fleeing. Once his\\n    wives consented each began the extensive preparations for the journey\\n    (keeping their secret from Laban\\'s people).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <h4 id=\"moving-sheep-and-goats\">Moving Sheep and Goats</h4>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Jacob\\'s first concern would be to get the sheep and goats moving because\\n    with nursing young they could hardly do ten miles a day. Cattle are good\\n    for twice that while camels can be used for rapid travel. Since Scripture\\n    states that Laban overtook Jacob in the hills of Gilead after a seven day\\n    pursuit and this appears to have been nearly 400 miles, the flocks must\\n    have been on the road at least 40 days. So how does this work?\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Once Jacob secured his wives agreement to leave Laban, he would have worked\\n    at getting the flocks across the Euphrates. This means he would have\\n    accompanied the shepherds for this most difficult task. If his flocks were\\n    already grazing a three days\\' journey west of Laban\\'s ranch, he would have\\n    spent most of a week getting them to and safely across the Euphrates. He\\n    would not be missed at the ranch as he was often in the fields with the\\n    flocks for periods of time.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Today, for several miles near Carchemish the Euphrates divides into two\\n    channels with an island between the channels. Possibly at one place one\\n    could wade across the first channel, then find a shallow part of the second\\n    channel somewhere else to wade across. We don\\'t know. Only the Scripture\\n    makes a point of saying that Jacob got all he had across the Euphrates.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Then he would cover the distance back to the ranch in two days to get his\\n    herds on the trail. This may have taken another week. By then the sheep and\\n    goats, divided into many flocks, would be 160 miles from the ranch (7 + 2 +\\n    7 = 16 days). Then Jacob would continue his plans to flee with his\\n    remaining household-wives, children, kindred and servants-closing out their\\n    lives in Haran and preparing for the long, perilous journey ahead. Possibly\\n    a trusted servant had been moving back and forth between the flocks, herds\\n    and ranch (on camel back) while Jacob\\'s household prepared. By one excuse\\n    or another to Laban\\'s people he may have been able to send off donkey\\n    trains of possessions during that week. When they were ready, possibly a\\n    week or so after the cattle left, Jacob\\'s wives must have said their\\n    goodbyes. With that Jacob put his family on camels and his household moved\\n    out. Laban\\'s people sent a runner to tell Laban. By this time the sheep\\n    would be 230 miles away (16 + 7 = 23 days).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Camels were the finest all around transportation in this part of the\\n    ancient world. In a caravan with heavy loads they typically covered 25\\n    miles a day or three miles an hour. They actually could walk all day at\\n    four miles an hour, but to conserve their energy, the drivers walked rather\\n    than rode. This slowed the caravan down to the pace and endurance of the\\n    drivers. Camels had been known to travel a hundred miles a day when\\n    employed for military purposes.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <h4 id=\"labans-pursuit\">Laban\\'s Pursuit</h4>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    On the third day Laban received word that Jacob had fled. Laban was\\n    shearing sheep. For Laban to take action, he first arranged care for the\\n    sheep being sheared, then made the three day journey back to the ranch and\\n    then organized an armed pursuit party on camels. Jacob would have about a\\n    ten day head start but that would not alarm Laban since the sheep with\\n    recently born lambs could only travel ten miles a day at most. What Laban\\n    had not counted on was that Jacob had sent the sheep ahead before returning\\n    to the ranch. By the time Laban was ready to pursue, the sheep were on the\\n    trail the equivalent of 33 days, 330 miles from Haran (23 + 3 +2 +3 + 2 =\\n    33 days). Meanwhile the herds had been on the trail 17 days so they would\\n    soon catch up with the flocks. Jacob and family had been on the trail ten\\n    days and were a good 250-300 miles from Haran. With camels they would soon\\n    catch up with the flocks, herds and donkey trains.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Scripture says it took Laban seven days to overtake Jacob. Just days\\n    before, Jacob\\'s cattle, donkeys and camels had all caught up with his\\n    flocks and they were now in the hill country of Gilead, 400 miles from\\n    Haran. Just as Jacob thought he was safe, Laban and his band appeared.\\n    While Laban had expected to find them just 170 miles from his ranch, it\\n    probably did not take him long to learn they were a great distance ahead of\\n    him so he would have gone into a forced day and night march. Even so for\\n    Laban to cover 400 miles in seven days, his camel army would have had to\\n    cover a punishing 55 miles a day. What an amazing flight on Jacob\\'s part.\\n    What an amazing pursuit on Laban\\'s part.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Nevertheless it was not that Jacob had reached familiar ground that\\n    protected him but none other than God Himself who appeared to Laban in a\\n    dream and warned him not to harm Jacob. In the end Laban and Jacob\\n    covenanted not to cross into each other\\'s lands for harm. Laban kissed his\\n    grandchildren and daughters and returned home. Again the angels of God\\n    appeared to Jacob. (Genesis 32:1). God was doing as He had originally\\n    promised at Bethel.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <h4 id=\"esau-advances-with-400-men\">Esau Advances with 400 Men</h4>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Then Jacob learned that his twin brother Esau was coming with a small army.\\n    He sent everyone ahead and was left alone. Yet he was not alone. He\\n    wrestled all night. The struggle was both spiritual and physical.\\n    \"Wrestling\" suggests a night of fervent prayer. Yet he sustained a lifetime\\n    physical injury. In the end his opponent said \"Your name shall no longer be\\n    called Jacob, but Israel, for you have striven with God and with men, and\\n    have prevailed.\" (Genesis 32:28). The new name has the connotation of power\\n    with God. Following this Jacob said, \"I have seen God face to face and yet\\n    my life has been delivered\" (Genesis 32:30). Jacob had encountered the\\n    preincarnate Christ.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Esau and his 400 men arrived. It looked like the end. Instead, \"Esau ran to\\n    meet him and embraced him and fell on his neck, and kissed him, and they\\n    wept\" (Genesis 33:4). Of this Jacob said: \"I have seen your face, which is\\n    like seeing the face of God, and you have accepted me\" (Genesis 33:10).\\n    Each visitation from God strengthened Jacob\\'s faith.\\n</p>\\n<h4 id=\"dinahs-humiliation\">\\n    Dinah\\'s Humiliation\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\n    Instead of returning to his father in Hebron for some unexplained reason\\n    Jacob bought land and settled in Shechem for the next 12 years. Then his\\n    daughter Dinah \"went out to see the women of the land\" (Genesis 34:1).\\n    Dinah was now old enough to socialize with the village women. The text does\\n    not mention an escort. Genesis 34:2 continues: \"When Shechem the son of\\n    Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the land, saw her, he seized her and lay\\n    with her and humiliated her.\" Having eleven older brothers she was used to\\n    receiving a lot of attention from boys and undoubtedly knew how to give and\\n    take a lot of innocent playfulness. Whatever he saw attracted him like a\\n    fly to flypaper. Then he lost control.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    At the least we can observe that Dinah acted indiscreetly. \"Going out to\\n    see the women\" suggests inexperience, an enlarging of her world. In all\\n    this visiting she must have met Shechem. She was poised, self-confident, a\\n    talker and playful. Maybe Shechem misinterpreted her innocent fun for\\n    something more. We have suggested she was fifteen years old. If she were\\n    older, she would know more about men outside of her family and be more\\n    careful. If she were much younger, she would be less desired as his wife.\\n    At fifteen she was a grown woman capable of marriage and suitable as a mate\\n    for the young prince. Fifteen fits the Scriptural chronology.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Dinah had six natural older brothers while Jacob\\'s other five sons were her\\n    step-brothers. Her oldest natural brother and Jacob\\'s first was Reuben. He\\n    was nine years older than her. Her brothers were beyond indignant. Shechem\\n    loved Dinah and asked his father to get her for his wife. When Shechem\\'s\\n    father asked Jacob to let his daughter marry his son, he said the two\\n    peoples could become one. Jacob\\'s sons said the Hivites would have to be\\n    circumcised first. So, all the men of the village were circumcised. Then\\n    two of Dinah\\'s natural brothers came and murdered all the men when they\\n    were in the most pain. These brothers, Simeon and Levi, were 23 and 22,\\n    eight and seven years older than Dinah.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Thinking the sons had to be older people ask, \"How could two young men kill\\n    all the men in an entire village?\" First, they came on the third day when\\n    the men were sore. Intense pain can incapacitate. The village men had no\\n    strength to fight back. Second, this question reinforces an earlier\\n    suggestion in this paper, that Abraham had gained military training in Ur.\\n    When he left Ur, he trained every able bodied male in his household in the\\n    art of defense. When the Jordan Valley was invaded and Lot was taken\\n    prisoner, Abraham \"led forth his trained men, born in his house, 318 of\\n    them&#8230;\" and with allies, completely vanquished an experienced,\\n    professional army (Genesis 14:14). That a 23 and 22 year old could put an\\n    entire village to the sword suggests Jacob also trained his sons in the use\\n    of the sword. Today 23 and 22 year old college football players display the\\n    kind of strength and determination that Jacob\\'s sons displayed. The other\\n    side sees the need for the sons to be seven years older, but they didn\\'t\\n    need to be 30 and 29 to wreak this havoc on the village.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    While the slaughter at Shechem possibly doubled Jacob\\'s wealth, his focus\\n    was on his and his family\\'s survival. He was angry and terrified expecting\\n    revenge from the Shechemites\\' fellow Canaanites. Little did he know that\\n    God would command Israel to destroy the Canaanite population five hundred\\n    years later. Could it be that the act of Simeon and Levi was divine\\n    judgment to break the hold of paganism on its surviving residents (over\\n    half of its population) and give them the opportunity to meet the true God\\n    and receive eternal life?\\n</p>\\n<h4 id=\"returning-to-bethel\">\\n    Returning to Bethel, the \"House of God\"\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\n    Jacob was appalled at his sons\\' action. After slaughtering the adult males\\n    of an entire village, all of his sons plundered what was left and took the\\n    wives and children. He said to Simeon and Levi, \"You have brought trouble\\n    on me by making me stink to the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites and\\n    the Perizzites. My numbers are few, and if they gather themselves against\\n    me and attack me, I shall be destroyed, both I and my household\" (Genesis\\n    34:30). Jacob must have cried out to God because we next read \"God said to\\n    Jacob, \\'Arise, go up to Bethel [Hebrew: beth-house; el-God; thus \"house of\\n    God\"] and dwell there. Make an altar there to the God who appeared to you\\n    when you fled from your brother Esau\\'\" (Genesis 35:1).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Bethel would allow a time of renewal and mark another step of faith. Jacob\\n    told his household and all who were with him, \"Put away the foreign gods\\n    that are among you and purify yourselves and change your garments. Then let\\n    us arise and go up to Bethel, so that I may make there an altar to the God\\n    who answers me in the day of my distress and has been with me wherever I\\n    have gone\" (Genesis 35:2-3). With him were his household plus many new\\n    faces--all those in the plunder of Shechem for Scripture previously\\n    reported: \"They (Jacob\\'s sons) took their flocks and their herds, their\\n    donkeys, and whatever was in the city and in the field. All their wealth,\\n    all their little ones and their wives, all that was in the houses, they\\n    captured and plundered\" (34:28-29).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Everyone with him was to put away the false gods, follow rites of cleansing\\n    and change their clothes in preparation for meeting the LORD. Jacob buried\\n    these instruments of idolatry and left for Bethel (Genesis 35:4). Along the\\n    way the Canaanites did not attack them. Instead \"a terror from God fell\\n    upon the cities that were around them, so that they did not pursue the sons\\n    of Jacob\" (Genesis 35:6). At Bethel he built an altar. God confirmed the\\n    Abrahamic Covenant to him (Genesis 35:11-12). The newcomers learned that\\n    God must be approached through the blood of a sacrifice as man had done\\n    since the time of Abel. With the death of Jesus the Christ, man learned\\n    that Old Testament sacrifices offered in faith were pictures of that one\\n    vicarious sacrifice for all time. When Jacob left home bound for his\\n    mother\\'s people, God appeared in a dream to Jacob, repeated the promises of\\n    land and population made to Abraham and the certainty that Jacob would\\n    return to this very place. Now, 32 years later God repeated those promises:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>\\n        <sup>11</sup>\\n        I am God Almighty [El Shaddai]: be fruitful and multiply. A nation and\\n        a company of nations shall come from you, and kings shall come from\\n        your own body. <sup>12</sup>The land that I gave to Abraham and Isaac,\\n        I will give to you, and I will give the land to your offspring after\\n        you. Genesis 35:11-12.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    God identified Himself as \"El Shaddai,\" the all-powerful God. No less than\\n    the One who created all things in six days stood behind these promises to\\n    Abraham, Isaac and now Jacob. The women and children of Shechem had been\\n    the pitiful victims of idolatry. Here they learned about the true God.\\n    Certainly many of them believed in Him and entered His Kingdom that day.\\n</p>\\n<h4 id=\"haggling-over-the-events\">\\n    Why All the Haggling Over the Events After Jacob Left Home?\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\n    The Ussher crowd feel compelled to change the story to fit the numbers. We\\n    agree that the birth of 12 children might be viewed as consecutive and thus\\n    produce the idea of marrying Leah and Rachel at the beginning of the\\n    fourteen years. We agree that placing the reported work contract at the\\n    beginning of the final six years might be understood from Scripture. We\\n    agree that later events require the children to be as old as possible when\\n    Jacob left Haran. But we have shown those devices are ruled out by\\n    Scripture. Our scheme suggests all twelve children were born in the ten\\n    years following Jacob\\'s first seven years of labor, leaving three plus\\n    years for God to work the miracle of the flocks\\' markings (7+10+3=20). This\\n    would mean Joseph and Dinah were a little over three years old when the\\n    family left Haran and Zebulun was only 15 months older.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    This view of their ages seems to be confirmed when Esau came to meet Jacob.\\n    Esau suggested they go the rest of the way together. Jacob replied, \"The\\n    children are frail and the nursing flocks and herds are a care to me\"\\n    (Genesis 33:13). \"Frail\" is probably an exaggeration but it suggests the\\n    youngest were still little ones, not much further along in development than\\n    the recently born sheep and goats. \"Children\" suggests that more than one\\n    child fit into this category. Viewing both Joseph and Dinah to be about\\n    three years old fits this statement nicely and makes her about fifteen when\\n    she was violated. She can\\'t have been much older when she was humbled\\n    because about two years later Joseph was sold into slavery at the age of\\n    seventeen (Genesis 37:2).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Is all this bickering necessary-when Jacob got his wives, whether the\\n    children were born one after another or some at the same time, Dinah\\'s age\\n    when she was raped, etc.? After all, what\\'s a few years? First, trifling\\n    with Scripture is no small matter. Second, determining when Joseph was born\\n    provides great insight into the chronology of Jacob\\'s life. Their view\\n    makes the first four boys seven years older than the view that follows\\n    Scripture. This changing of Scripture ultimately supports their view of how\\n    to take Hebrew genealogies and the idea that Scripture reveals the age of\\n    the earth within a few years. Changing the record is a critical issue.\\n</p>\\n<h3 id=\"final-years-of-jacob\">\\n    Final Years of Jacob\\n</h3>\\n<p>\\n    Tears also were shed at Bethel. There Deborah, Rebekah\\'s nurse died and was\\n    buried under an oak. The place was named \"Allon-bacuth\" (oak of weeping;\\n    Genesis 35:8). Possibly this woman had cared for Jacob in his infancy and\\n    his mother as she aged. She was a pleasant reminder of his parent\\'s home\\n    before he fled from Esau 32 years before. During this long absence Rebekah\\n    died and her nurse came to help with all the children born to Jacob. Now\\n    just weeks before they arrived back at Hebron and rejoined his aged father,\\n    more tears.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    More tears a short distance further. Jacob\\'s beloved Rachel went into labor\\n    near Bethlehem which was called Ephrath in those days. Rachel had prayed\\n    for another son (Genesis 30:24) and now God answered. The child Benjamin\\n    lived, but his mother died in childbirth. This was Jacob\\'s twelfth and last\\n    son. Over a thousand years later Micah would prophecy that the most\\n    significant son in all human history would be born there. The second person\\n    of the godhead, God the Son, would become clothed with humanity in that\\n    very place.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    But you, O Bethlehem Ephrathah, who are too little to be among the clans of\\n    Judah, from you shall come forth for me one who is to be ruler in Israel,\\n    whose coming forth is from of old, from ancient days. Micah 5:2.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    In a single verse (Genesis 35:22) Scripture reports another heartbreak\\n    Jacob suffered. His oldest son committed fornication with his beloved\\n    wife\\'s handmaid, Bilhah. It was like violating the memory of Rachel.\\n    Scripture calls her \"his father\\'s concubine.\" Most likely, Bilhah bore some\\n    of Jacob\\'s daughters. We don\\'t hear any more of this until Jacob blesses\\n    his sons on his death bed. There he says,\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <sup>3</sup>\\n    Reuben, you are my firstborn, my might and the firstfruits of my strength,\\n    preeminent in dignity and preeminent in power. <sup>4</sup>Unstable as\\n    water, you shall not have preeminence, because you went up to your father\\'s\\n    bed; then you defiled it-he went up to my couch! Genesis 49:2-3.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Finally, Jacob arrived \"at Mamre, or Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron), where\\n    Abraham and Isaac had sojourned. Now the days of Isaac were 180 years. And\\n    Isaac breathed his last, and he died and was gathered to his people, old\\n    and full of days. And his sons Esau and Jacob buried him\" (Genesis\\n    35:27-29). Jacob had spent 20 years with Laban and another 12 in Canaan. He\\n    was 106 and his father was 166. Fourteen years later his father died and\\n    the twins buried him.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Genesis 35, what an eventful chapter-Jacob returning to Bethel, God Himself\\n    bearing the name El Shaddai restating the promises, the birth of Benjamin\\n    and those final years with his father Isaac. But they were also painful\\n    times in his life: the death of his mother\\'s nurse who related to Jacob\\n    memories of those years of his mother\\'s life he would otherwise never know\\n    since he never saw her after he fled 32 years before. It tells of the death\\n    of the joy of his life, Rachel. It tells of Reuben\\'s moral failure. He was\\n    the one who should have led the nation that God would make Abraham into.\\n    Reuben lost the family priesthood to Levi, the double portion to Joseph and\\n    the right to rule the nation to Judah.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    During Jacob\\'s 32 year absence Esau lived for a time with his parents,\\n    Isaac and Rebekah, who must have harbored a deep, quiet grief for Jacob.\\n    Esau no longer had to compete with Jacob who seemed unmatchable. As he\\n    became the sole heir of all his father had, he mellowed. Apparently, he\\n    eventually showed interest in the stories of God\\'s appearances to his\\n    grandfather and father and finally believed. After 20 years of absence, he\\n    welcomed Jacob home with tears, forgiving his brother who had purchased his\\n    birthright and stolen his father\\'s blessing. God honored Esau with an\\n    entire chapter of the Bible, a long one at that, devoted to a 500-year\\n    record of his descendants (Genesis 36).\\n</p>\\n<h3 id=\"joseph-favorite-slave-ruler\">\\n    Joseph: Favorite, Slave, Ruler\\n</h3>\\n<p>\\n    Everyone knows how Joseph told his dreams to his family-in his dreams they\\n    actually bowed down to him! Many commentators have pointed out this would\\n    not be well received. But what may be missed in the picture is that Jacob\\n    was no longer spry. He had become increasingly dependent on others. He no\\n    longer spent his time in the fields. As he watched his sons, he saw their\\n    various abilities-strength, energy, devotion, intelligence and even their\\n    management weaknesses. Of them all, Joseph had the sharpest eyes and the\\n    best ideas. Joseph saw poor shepherding practices and reported them to\\n    Jacob. Undoubtedly when Jacob tried to correct them, the brothers came to\\n    realize that Joseph was telling on them.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Jacob no longer had his precious Rachel, but he had her son who reminded\\n    him of the qualities he saw in her. He couldn\\'t hide it. Joseph was his\\n    favorite, brilliant like his father, in a class all of his own. Someone had\\n    to be Jacob\\'s go between; keep tabs on what his sons were doing. Without\\n    supervision the flocks would remain mediocre or even decrease. So Jacob\\n    dressed Joseph in that distinctive robe of many colors indicating some kind\\n    of position or authority. Lacking the humility that accompanies\\n    righteousness his brothers hated him.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Most people who are familiar with the Bible know what happened next. His\\n    father sent him to check on his brothers. Joseph was 17. His father would\\n    not see him again for another 22 years. Joseph found his brothers way up in\\n    Dothan, an area even north of Shechem. Possibly the summer was unusually\\n    dry so they had moved the flocks 60 miles north of Hebron to find suitable\\n    pasture for their sheep. The brothers saw Jacob coming, put him in a well\\n    and when Midianite traders came along sold him into slavery. They took his\\n    colored coat, dipped it in blood and showed Jacob. Jacob was convinced\\n    Joseph had been eaten by a wild animal. Scripture describes how the loss\\n    affected him:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <sup>34</sup>\\n    Then Jacob tore his garments and put sackcloth on his loins and mourned for\\n    his son many days. <sup>35</sup>All his sons and all his daughters rose up\\n    to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted and said, \"No, I shall go\\n    down to Sheol to my son, mourning.\" Thus his father wept for him. Genesis\\n    37:34-35.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The writer of sacred writ turns aside for a moment from Joseph to devote an\\n    entire chapter to another unfolding event \"at that time\" (Genesis 38:1).\\n    Sometime around when Joseph was sold into slavery at the age of 17, Judah,\\n    Jacob\\'s fourth oldest son, at about the age of 23 married a Canaanite woman\\n    with whom he fathered three sons-Er, Onan and Shelah. When the oldest\\n    arrived at a marriageable age, Judah arranged for him to marry Tamar, a\\n    Canaanite woman. In time the son acted wickedly and God slew him. Tamar was\\n    given to the second and over time he did the same. Judah told Tamar to\\n    remain a widow until his youngest son was of age. Then Judah\\'s wife died.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Grieving Judah went with his Adullamite friend Hirah to shear his sheep.\\n    Tamar heard of his plans. Realizing that the third son was not being given\\n    to her, she dressed as a prostitute and stationed herself where he would\\n    pass. Grieving Judah in a moment of weakness seized this easy opportunity\\n    and went in to her, not realizing this was his daughter-in-law. Later he\\n    learned she was pregnant and ordered her execution. Then he learned who the\\n    father was and declared she was more righteous than he. He never touched\\n    her again but she delivered twins and the line of Christ passed through\\n    one. The story had to be told or there would forever be a question about\\n    how the line of Christ could pass through Judah and his daughter-in-law.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    A byproduct of this event is insight into Hebrew genealogies. Here are the\\n    biblical numbers: Jacob spent 20 years with uncle Laban. Twelve years later\\n    Dinah was raped and the Shechemites were slaughtered. We estimate that both\\n    she and Joseph were about fifteen at the time. Joseph was sold into slavery\\n    two years later. Just 22 years after that when Judah was 45 Jacob moved his\\n    household to Egypt. Since Genesis 38 begins \"At that time\" and follows\\n    Genesis 37 which tells the story of selling Joseph into slavery, we cannot\\n    give the exact year but it had to be close to when Joseph was betrayed at\\n    the age of 17 and Judah was about 23. Just 22 years later Jacob would move\\n    his brood to Egypt.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Here is the interesting thing: in approximately 22 years Judah fathered\\n    three sons. In the next 20 years each in his turn grew to adulthood and two\\n    married. Tamar was married to the first, then the second. Then Judah\\n    unintentionally fathered twins by her as he was beguiled by her prostitute\\n    outfit and hurting from the loss of his wife. The list of those\\n    accompanying Jacob to Egypt (Genesis 46:8-27) includes, of course, Judah.\\n    He would have been about 45. It also lists his three sons but notes that\\n    two died in the land of Canaan. Since the first two reached adulthood, were\\n    married one after the other to the Canaanite woman Tamar, Judah would have\\n    been between the ages of 23 and 25 when they were born. Then he impregnated\\n    Tamar and a second set of sons was born to him, the twins Perez and Zerah.\\n    The list even includes two sons of Perez, Hezron and Hamul.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Our first lesson is that at least some of Jacob\\'s sons/grandsons were\\n    marrying early, very early, like at the age of 17 or 18 whereas those first\\n    seven named generations born after the Flood all started families between\\n    the ages of 29 and 34. We only mention this now. It will all be developed\\n    fully in later chapters. Our second lesson is that the twins were either\\n    infants or still in Tamar\\'s womb when Jacob moved his family to Egypt. This\\n    point should make us cautious about how to take the list of those Jacob\\n    took to Egypt.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Our third lesson is that two sons of Perez are also found in the list\\n    (Genesis 46:12). Clearly, they were unborn at the time of the move. Yet\\n    Scripture says \"All the persons belonging to Jacob who came into Egypt, who\\n    were his own descendants&#8230;were 66 persons in all\" (Genesis 46:26). How\\n    could they possibly go down to Egypt when they were not even alive?\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Obviously Hebrew genealogies have a different purpose than those of most\\n    peoples. Judah, his son Perez, and grandson, Hezron, established the line\\n    of Christ in Israel. Recording them overrode the obvious fact that at least\\n    Hezron was not even conceived at the time of the move. Perez would not\\n    marry for another 15 or 20 years at the soonest to father his sons\\n    mentioned among the 66 who went with Jacob to Egypt. Obviously genealogies\\n    could include sons still in the loins of their father. This is not\\n    surprising when one considers that the primary purpose of Hebrew\\n    genealogies was identity not succession. In this case the Holy Spirit was\\n    establishing the clans of Jacob at the earliest possible opportunity. What\\n    better place to begin than when Jacob moved to Egypt?\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    One other note: Benjamin was born after the slaughter of the Shechemites,\\n    about 24 years before the move to Egypt. Ten sons are credited to him yet\\n    he is just 24 years old. Some must have been grandsons and thus still in\\n    the womb at the time of the move. It is also possible that a scribal error\\n    copied several sons that a later list ascribes to one of his brothers. We\\n    will look at this also.\\n</p>\\n<h4 id=\"rise-of-joseph\">\\n    The Rise of Joseph\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\n    Now to gather lessons from Joseph. The Midianites sold him to the captain\\n    of pharaoh\\'s palace guard. We suggest that in no time the Midianites\\n    discovered this kid was pure gold. Not too many years later Potiphar\\n    discovered the same thing, entrusting his entire household to Joseph\\'s\\n    care. We all remember how Mrs. Potiphar thought he was a catch. For her\\n    indiscretion Joseph landed in the royal prison under Potiphar\\'s care. Maybe\\n    Potiphar put in some good words to the warden. Joseph came to be in charge\\n    of the crown\\'s personal prisoners.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Jacob had seen in Joseph a genius unlike any of his other sons. It is\\n    understandable that this aging man wanted his vast estate in the best\\n    possible hands. Too bad Joseph\\'s brothers lacked the necessary humility to\\n    allow this to happen. Fast forward thirteen years to the dream that drove\\n    Pharaoh crazy. Joseph not only interpreted the dream, but had an immediate\\n    plan of action for the coming famine. Pharaoh should find a wise man to\\n    collect the surplus grain during the good years. In that moment Pharaoh saw\\n    in Joseph someone who could do the job and promoted this prisoner on the\\n    spot to number two in the great empire of Egypt. Joseph was just 30 years\\n    old and nine years later would rescue his family from starvation. Jacob was\\n    right. Joseph had talent.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Like all aging fathers, Jacob became increasingly dependent on his\\n    household as the end drew near. When they moved to Egypt Jacob was 130\\n    years old. Genesis 46:5 reports \"The sons of Israel carried Jacob their\\n    father, their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons that Pharaoh had\\n    sent to carry him.\" He would die 17 years later.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Those who prefer numbers to words have reworked the scriptural account of\\n    Jacob to no avail. In this chapter we have upheld the following details in\\n    Jacob\\'s life\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    1. He served Laban seven years before he was given his wives, Leah and\\n    Rachel. Over the next approximately ten years he fathered twelve children\\n    by four women.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    2. Jacob states Laban changed his wages ten times. Five work contracts are\\n    stated or hinted at. After working fourteen years for his two wives, he\\n    served Laban six years for his flocks which he parleyed into herds, camels\\n    and donkeys as well. That work contract is not stated but is marked by the\\n    beginning of a six year period in which his pay would be in terms of\\n    livestock. About three years later Joseph was born and Laban offered the\\n    dream contract, one Jacob couldn\\'t refuse. This is the one recorded in\\n    detail (Genesis 30:25-34). About 3-3 &#189; years later Jacob returned to\\n    Canaan.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    3. Unlike his brothers, Joseph was an administrative genius. When his aged\\n    father could no longer give personal supervision, he informally designated\\n    the second youngest brother as a sort of supervisor over his ten older\\n    brothers. Their reaction was predictable. They hated him. Maybe it somewhat\\n    had to do with a seething sense of injustice in the family, the way Jacob\\n    had treated their mother Leah in the early years versus the way he treated\\n    Joseph\\'s mother during that period. They sold Joseph into slavery. Just\\n    thirteen years later Joseph became the governor of Egypt under Pharaoh.\\n    Nine years after that when Joseph is 39, the family was reunited in Egypt.\\n    Jacob was 130. This means Jacob was 91 when Joseph was born and allows the\\n    fixing of times and ages-Jacob was 74 when he moved to Haran, 81 when he\\n    got his wives, 94 when he returned to Canaan. Joseph and Dinah were then\\n    possibly just over three years old.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    4. Scripture specifically says Joseph was 17 when his brothers betrayed\\n    him. This happened shortly after Dinah was raped in Shechem, certainly no\\n    more than two years after, making her about 15 when she was humbled. Also,\\n    about the time Joseph was enslaved the sordid tale of Judah began to unfold\\n    (Genesis 38). By the time he was 45, when they moved to Egypt, his three\\n    sons had been born, and the oldest two, Er and Onan were dead. Judah had\\n    impregnated Tamar, the former wife of Onan, and she had given birth to\\n    Perez and Zerah.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    5. Conclusion: Without forcing it, the biblical timeline works. No need to\\n    rewrite the words of Scripture to harmonize with its numbers. These events\\n    give us further insights into the character of Hebrew genealogies which\\n    come in the next chapters.\\n</p>\\n<h3 id=\"early-biblical-chronology\">\\n    Early Biblical Chronology\\n</h3>\\n<p>\\n    <h4 id=\"chronology-of-jacobs-family\">Chronology of Jacob\\'s Family</h4>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Now we can calculate the critical mile markers in Jacob\\'s life within a\\n    year or so. Jacob was 130 when he was presented to Pharaoh (Genesis 47:9).\\n    Joseph was promoted by Pharaoh when he was 30 (Genesis 41:46). Seven years\\n    of plenty and two years of famine had passed before his family moved to\\n    Egypt (Genesis 45:6). This makes Joseph 39 when they arrived (30+7+2=39)\\n    and Jacob 91 when Joseph was born (130-39=91). Joseph was three years old\\n    when his family left Haran, so Jacob left Laban when he was 94 years old\\n    (91+3=94). Jacob served Laban 20 years so he left home at the age of 74\\n    (94-20=74). After serving Laban seven years he married Leah and Rachel at\\n    the age of 81 (74+7=81). Reuben was born when Jacob was 82 years old and\\n    thus Reuben was 48 years old when the family moved to Egypt (130-82=48).\\n    All these numbers are rounded and could be slightly off, but certainly not\\n    more than six to twelve months altogether. These critical events with their\\n    dates are grouped next: <strong> </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong> <u>Jacob\\'s Age</u> <u>Event or Period in Jacob\\'s Life</u></strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    0-74 Jacob, younger twin of Isaac and Rebekah, lives with parents\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    40 Jacob\\'s brother marries two Canaanite women who upset parents\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    40-74 Jacob sees their grief; chooses not to marry a Canaanite woman\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    74 Jacob leaves home (returns to Canaan 20 years later)\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    74-88 Jacob serves fourteen years for Laban\\'s two daughters\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    81 Marries Leah and Rachel after serving seven of the fourteen years\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    82 Fathers Reuben, his firstborn, by Leah\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    88-94 Jacob serves Laban six additional years for his flocks (contract not\\n    recorded)\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    91 Joseph and Dinah are born during this six-year period\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    91 Dream work contract recorded in Genesis 30:25-43\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    94 Returns to Canaan after 20 years in Haran\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    94-130 Jacob lives in Canaan thirty-six years before moving to Egypt\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    94-106 Twelve years in Succoth and Shechem\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    106 Dinah raped at the age of 15.

That basic\\n    chronology is found in Appendix Table B.1 which begins with the commonly\\n    accepted date for the start of Solomon\\'s temple, 966 BC, adds the 480 years\\n    of I Kings 6:1 for the period of the Judges, adds the 430-year sojourn in\\n    Egypt, the 215-year sojourn in Canaan and the 75 years before Abraham\\n    reached Canaan. This basic chronology then becomes the foundation to a\\n    complete biblical chronology going back to Adam. But since that one must\\n    allow for the estimated missing names in Shem\\'s and Adam\\'s lists, it will\\n    not be fully explained until chapter 7. Nevertheless, it stands as Appendix\\n    Tables B.2 and B.3 for those who want to peak ahead. Those numbers are\\n    placed in an easy to find location following the 21 arguments for\\n    abbreviated genealogies at the beginning of the Appendix.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    What an effort-nearly 40 pages to scrutinize details in the lives of\\n    Abraham and Jacob in order to overturn numerous faulty interpretations\\n    adopted to support 215-years in Egypt. With these errant interpretations\\n    corrected, we can now come to the heart of this book-the nature and\\n    function of Hebrew genealogies (chapter 5), over a dozen abbreviated\\n    genealogies (chapter 6) and the granddaddy of all abbreviated genealogies,\\n    that of Shem (chapter 7).\\n</p>\\n<br clear=\"all\"/>\\n<p>\\n    <strong> </strong>\\n</p>\\n<div>\\n    <br clear=\"all\"/>\\n    <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"/>\\n    <div id=\"ftn1\">\\n        <p>\\n            <a href=\"#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\" title=\"\">\\n                <sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup>\\n            </a>\\n            Merrill F.

Most importantly, God himself established\\n    them. In elegance they can be a long list of immediate father-son\\n    relationships or as brief as “Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of\\n    Abraham” (Matthew 1:1). Profound—they identify the fathers of post-Flood\\n    people groups that repopulated the world. Mysterious—they speak of ten sons\\n    accompanying 24-year old Benjamin to Egypt (a 24-year old with ten sons?).\\n    They also include the two unborn sons of baby Perez among the 66\\n    descendants of Jacob who went down to Egypt.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Flexible—they are not always a record of immediate father-son\\n    relationships; rather, they are elastic enough to include future\\n    descendants under the concept that all future generations are in the loins\\n    of their forefathers. In this way the record could be particularly tailored\\n    to meet the author’s purpose with remarkable efficiency.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    In purpose and function they provide identity and explanation—who am I?\\n    Where do I belong? How did it happen? With brevity they record: 1) the\\n    spread of man after the Flood; 2) Abraham’s ancestors; 3) Israel’s\\n    organization.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    A three-tier division of Jacob’s descendants (tribe/clan/household) insured\\n    brilliant organization and maximum security in the wilderness and fair\\n    division of the land in Canaan. In effect, the genealogies told each family\\n    where to pitch its tent in a camp of 2.5 million and where to settle down\\n    in the spacious Promised Land. They especially confirm that Jesus was truly\\n    human. While biblical genealogies have similarities to the genealogies of\\n    monarchial societies through the ages, they also have significant\\n    differences and must be explained in a way consistent with biblical use.\\n</p>\\n<h4 id=\\'genealogies-organized-israel\\'>\\n    Genealogies Organized Israel\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\n    Free at last; no longer slaves under the yoke of Egypt. But what would keep\\n    these former slaves from exploiting each other as they had been exploited?\\n    In a word, genealogies. The ex-slaves had to think and act like free people\\n    and stand together as a nation. To keep them from destroying each other\\n    before they learned those new ways, genealogies helped organize them so\\n    they would live together in a civilized way.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    When God delivered Israel from Egypt, He gave Moses an amazingly simple yet\\n    efficient way to organize the people. He grouped them by tribe, clan, and\\n    households that contained even smaller divisions. At the center of the camp\\n    in the wilderness was the Tabernacle surrounded by an open area large\\n    enough to assemble the nation. Beyond that the three clans of Levi camped\\n    on three sides of the Tabernacle while the families of Moses and Aaron\\n    camped beyond the assembly area in front. Beyond the Levites was an\\n    assembly area for common activities. Beyond this, possibly a mile from the\\n    Tabernacle, began the camps of the people. Three tribes camped side by side\\n    on each of the four sides, radiating out like wedges. Each tribe was\\n    divided into three to six clans, approximately 50-60 clans in all. Clans\\n    ranged from 10,000 to 50,000 members. Divisions further extended to\\n    thousands, hundreds and tens. Adult males provided the basis for population\\n    counts.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Each person living in his own unit restrained theft and promoted acceptable\\n    behavior. Everyone knew the people around them. Their neighbors were their\\n    relatives. Each witnessed the other’s actions. Due to distances, people in\\n    one tribe had little association with people in another tribe. The life of\\n    each person centered around where his genealogy put him. Those Levites over\\n    the age of 50 were spared transporting the Tabernacle and became the guards\\n    at the heart of the nation. If an unauthorized person entered that inner\\n    circle, he was to be executed—except on those occasions where individuals\\n    or the entire nation were summoned to join Moses at the Tabernacle which\\n    was also called “The Tent of Meeting.” One didn’t just wander anywhere\\n    through the camp. People were born, married and died in their own\\n    organizational unit.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    So, a person’s genealogy told him who he was, where he belonged, where he\\n    placed his tent and who his neighbors would be. Slaves could be ornery,\\n    stubborn. Sometimes it took a whip to keep them in line. Now the whip was\\n    gone. Genealogies were doing what the whip had done. Yes, the people were\\n    free from servitude in Egypt, but their freedom had limits. They didn’t\\n    have to work for others twelve hours a day and they didn’t have to spend\\n    their days confined to the work area of a slave gang, but God put an\\n    impressive amount of structure in their lives. Can we picture it?\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    When this sea of people arrived at a new location, they set up their unit\\n    in relation to the whole. Tribal and clan leaders designated areas for\\n    tents, established corridors, marked and cleared open spaces for manna,\\n    designated the special places outside the camp and set up necessary\\n    services for the function of each unit. With practice they became\\n    efficient. The Tabernacle, first assembly space, Levite tent area and\\n    second open area must have stretched a mile in every direction from the\\n    center, the Tabernacle. Then came the tribes divided into clans and clans\\n    divided into households radiating out for another three miles or so.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    To be sure, there was more desirable real estate. The tribal and clan heads\\n    pitched their tents nearest the Tabernacle. Those of lesser position tented\\n    further out in their clan’s living space. If the farthest tents were four\\n    miles from the Tabernacle, all people could collect at the Tabernacle and\\n    return to their tents the same day. This walk probably motivated families\\n    to earn the right to camp closer to the front of their tribe’s wedge. This\\n    densely packed part of the camp would cover an area of over 50 square miles\\n    (eight miles across or 4<sup>2</sup>*3.14).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Joshua 7:24 says Achan had “oxen, donkeys and sheep.” If these animals were\\n    kept in the camp their manure would foul the manna and the camp would be\\n    hopelessly spread out. More likely the herds and flocks were kept in\\n    specially designated areas outside the camp proper. Other specially\\n    designated areas would have been used for temporarily unclean individuals,\\n    for lepers, for burying the dead or disposing of waste, among others. These\\n    specially designated areas could have occupied a band three miles across\\n    outside the living area. A camp 14 miles in diameter would have an area of\\n    150 square miles, the inner 50 for living and the outer 100 for specially\\n    designated functions. This vast distance was good reason that people mostly\\n    lived and mixed within their designated areas—tribes, clans, households,\\n    etc.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <h4 id=\\'daily-life-in-the-wilderness\\'>Daily Life in the Wilderness</h4>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Picture the people rising early to gather their daily portion of manna.\\n    Their desire for manna that was still fresh before the heat of the day\\n    spoiled it would have been adequate motivation to brave the nippy early\\n    morning desert cold. Perhaps each person spent the first hour or more of\\n    daylight to gather one day’s worth. In this way God saw to it that each\\n    individual exercised daily. If one area was gathered clean, people would\\n    have to search for areas that still had a supply. Manna was a perfect food\\n    but most likely the effort required to gather it limited over eating and\\n    thus becoming overweight.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Then people would relax while they enjoyed the first meal of the day and\\n    chatted about the daily tasks needing attention. Women, of course, would be\\n    caring for young children. Waste had to be carried to designated areas and\\n    buried. Just carrying water might occupy hours of a teenaged sibling. The\\n    people gathered wood, bartered and traded services and cooked meals while\\n    the 600,000 men of the camp conducted their morning military drills. Many\\n    serviced their herds and flocks while others developed professions and\\n    specialties. Maybe all this was done before the sun was high in the sky and\\n    it was time for a long afternoon nap. There were many special days, days\\n    for instruction, days for their religious life and plenty of time to get\\n    into trouble for those so inclined. So went life for that vast multitude,\\n    thankfully protected by cloud from the burning daytime sun and by the\\n    pillar of fire during the cold desert night.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Moses had an army to train and command. Like all generals he needed to know\\n    how many troops were available for the day. Most likely it was a day for\\n    training, but it might be a day for action. He must have taken a “morning\\n    report” as military commanders generally do. How would it work? Possibly at\\n    a certain time the horns were blown at headquarters for the morning report.\\n    The horns at each tribe a mile from the Tent of Meeting would repeat the\\n    call. Those in charge of ten had already made the rounds to determine the\\n    able bodied. When the horns sounded, each sprinted off to his captain of\\n    100 with his report.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The captain of 100 made a quick tabulation and hurried to the next level,\\n    the captain of a thousand. Those reports went to the clan leaders who most\\n    likely were near the tents of the tribal leaders. The tribal leaders made\\n    their tallies and sent them with runners to the Tent of Meeting. Possibly\\n    this was all accomplished in just half an hour. The officials at the Tent\\n    of Meeting tabulated the twelve tribal reports. Moses and his staff\\n    determined the training activities for the day. The trumpets sounded a\\n    second time and the available men, usually over 600,000, did as the trumpet\\n    calls directed. Most likely, they assembled in front of their tribe, in the\\n    space between the Levites and the general body of people. There they\\n    carried out the orders of the day.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    God began this consciousness of being a nation with His original call to\\n    Abraham when He told him he would become a nation. God repeated this idea\\n    to Isaac and again to Jacob: “Do not be afraid to go down to Egypt, for\\n    there I will make you into a great nation” (Genesis 46:3). Genesis 46:8\\n    says “Now these are the names of the descendants of Israel, who came into\\n    Egypt…” and then names those descendants. Jacob’s sons became the tribes of\\n    Israel. The clans and households of Israel arose from their descendants.\\n</p>\\n<h4 id=\\'difficulties-in-following-genealogical-lists\\'>\\n    Difficulties in Following Genealogical Lists\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\n    Untangling Hebrew genealogies is challenging. The challenge begins with the\\n    person’s name. Generally, just one name is given for a particular Hebrew in\\n    any given passage. Imagine how difficult it would be to keep people\\n    straight if everyone was “David” or “Mary” or “Bill” in today’s society.\\n    One helpful device was naming certain people along with their father’s name\\n    (“Joshua the son of Nun;” “Caleb the son of Jephthunnah”). Some names were\\n    quite popular even then so various people answered to the same name. In\\n    fact, more than one person answered to many of the names found in the Old\\n    Testament and in one case twenty-three people found in Scripture bore the\\n    same name. Families gave their sons the name of a beloved grandfather or\\n    famous person. Abraham’s grandfather and brother both bear the name\\n    “Nahor.” Sometimes people were named after places special to families.\\n    Terah named Abraham’s oldest brother, Haran, after the city by that name.\\n    To further complicate matters, some Hebrews were known by several names, so\\n    various authors used different names for the same person. Relational words\\n    such as “son” could refer to an immediate descendant or a more distant one.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Perhaps writing material was scarce or expensive, so Hebrew authors\\n    practiced brevity and efficiency in listing descendants. Because relational\\n    words (father, son, daughter, brother, sister) could be used narrowly or\\n    broadly, when we read “son of,” for instance, it is often impossible to\\n    know if a particular list is condensed or complete. Thus, one cannot assume\\n    that the same name in two different places is the same individual or that a\\n    list of names is always inclusive. This is the most difficult challenge in\\n    sorting out Hebrew genealogies and the one that has led to the most\\n    distorted notions that claim to be based on the Word of God. This book\\n    would not be written if well-meaning, inerrancy-believing rank-and-file\\n    Christians had discerned that Hebrew genealogies were more often\\n    abbreviated than not.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Having seen how, on the one hand, genealogies provided identification, but\\n    on the other hand are difficult to sort out, we will now turn to their use.\\n    First, we will look at the use of basic relational terms—father, son, etc.\\n    Immediately we are in for a shock until we learn to think the way Hebrews\\n    used those words. In a moment, you will read that there was no word for\\n    “grandson” so the single word “son” covered all possibilities. Since our\\n    first reaction will be skepticism, we must offer numerous examples. Then we\\n    will proceed to more difficult (and more unbelievable) ways Hebrews\\n    rendered lists of their descendants. For instance, the total number of\\n    those going down to Egypt with Jacob includes unborn sons on the one hand\\n    and omits most of the daughters on the other hand, even though we read,\\n    “All the persons belonging to Jacob who came into Egypt, who were his own\\n    descendants, not including Jacob’s sons’ wives were sixty-six persons in\\n    all” (Genesis 46:26).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Building on this foundation, we take up case after case of abbreviated\\n    genealogies in chapter six. Won’t two or three examples do? Few are\\n    iron-clad. While this author has rendered his best judgment, some examples\\n    may be legitimately questioned. But with a preponderance of examples, the\\n    case becomes overwhelming.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The light is coming. We have been encouraged by recently printed statements\\n    in standard young earth creation periodicals like “OK, maybe Israel was in\\n    Egypt 430-years, not 215,” and “yes, perhaps, on occasion, Hebrew\\n    genealogies are abbreviated, but the Genesis 11 genealogy is\\n    comprehensive.” The thinking of young earth creationists is going in the\\n    right direction. But we believe ample evidence exists that Genesis 11,\\n    along with many other Hebrew genealogies, is condensed. Finally, with great\\n    reverence, we must realize that our Savior’s genealogy is a Hebrew\\n    genealogy and it, too, is a matter of identity, not completeness.\\n</p>\\n<h4 id=\\'simple-hebrew-vocabulary\\'>\\n    Simple Hebrew Vocabulary\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\n    Biblical Hebrew had no words for relationships like grandfather, grandson,\\n    uncle, cousin, etc. The standard relationship words were words like father,\\n    mother, son, daughter, brother and sister. So, when the word father was\\n    used, it might mean immediate father, but it also might mean grandfather or\\n    more distant ancestor. In the same way when the word son was used, it might\\n    mean immediate son, grandson or more remote descendant. The women said,\\n    “Naomi has a son,” when in fact Ruth’s baby was Naomi’s grandson (Ruth\\n    4:17). The first verse of the New Testament says “Jesus, son of David, son\\n    of Abraham,” when later verses show that Jesus lived many generations after\\n    David and David lived many generations after Abraham.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The verb “to bear/to beget” (Hebrew-YLD) was used in the same general way.\\n    The one born might be the immediate offspring or a more distant offspring\\n    or all descendants of an individual (sons of Israel). In response to our\\n    email question, “I can only find four Old Testament examples of YLD [“to\\n    beget/to bear”] referring to offspring more distant than son or daughter.\\n    How can I be sure?” Arie Uittenbogaard of Abarim Publications replied,\\n    “Common knowledge. In Hebrew father- and motherhood extend beyond the\\nprimary biological generation.”    <a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\" title=\"\">[1]</a>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    In effect this man was saying that examples are unnecessary. Among users of\\n    Hebrew, it is common knowledge that the verb “to bear/to beget” can be used\\n    for both immediate and later generations. As previously stated, the Hebrew\\n    concept is that all future generations are in the loins of the present\\n    generation and therefore the present generation produces all future\\n    generations. Thus, the Hebrews used these basic relational terms in both\\n    narrow and broad senses while more specific relationship terms are used\\n    most other languages.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Flexible/elastic. A Hebrew genealogy could (and often did) contain both\\n    immediate descendants and more distant descendants without any indication\\n    that some intermediate generations were omitted. We can conclude this\\n    because of what we have already seen as well as what we are about to see\\n    again and again. Our original example was that of Kohath-Amram-Aaron which\\n    reads like they were immediate father-son relationships. While Amram was\\n    the immediate son of Kohath, a number of unnamed sons stood between Amram\\n    and Aaron.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Moses wrote his older brother’s genealogy in Exodus six. He knew who their\\n    parents were and most likely every forefather back to Levi. But he did not\\n    name them all. There was no need. An abbreviated list adequately showed\\n    Aaron’s roots and thus where he belonged in the organization of Israel. So,\\n    Moses named their forefather who was a grandson of Levi and their\\n    foremother who was a daughter of Levi. Amram and Jochebed were highly\\n    visible ancestors among Jacob’s descendants. That connection made Moses and\\n    Aaron legitimate descendants of noted stock in Israel. Their lineage was\\n    beyond any challenge.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    No one disputes that relational words are used in the Bible in a general\\n    sense such as “the sons of Israel” where all the descendants of Jacob are\\n    called “sons.” But it is less well known that they are also used widely in\\n    a broad sense when individuals are spoken of. Such misunderstanding leads\\n    to grave misinterpretations of Scripture. Thus, there is a great need to\\n    see numerous examples of this use of relational words.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The following section provides such examples. While those familiar with the\\n    Bible will immediately understand many of the examples, explanation is\\n    given so that all may understand. First a simple example is given of each\\n    relational category used in a broad sense; then more complex examples are\\n    provided. Further insights will be developed as examples are explored.\\n</p>\\n<h3 id=\\'example-of-each-kinship-term\\'>\\n    Example of Each Kinship Term Used in a Broad Sense\\n</h3>\\n<p>\\n    <strong><u>To Beget/To Bear</u></strong>\\n    <strong>.</strong>\\nUse of the Hebrew verb <em>beget/bear</em> (YLD) in a broad sense:    <strong></strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <sup>58</sup>\\n    Kohath was the father of Amram. <sup>59</sup>Jochebed <u>bore</u> to Amram\\n    Aaron and Moses and Miriam.

Here is a second instance of bearing referring to\\n    someone other than an immediate offspring.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    While this broad use of the concept of “to bear, to beget” is unfamiliar to\\n    most, Hebrew language scholars such as noted scholar and commentator C.F.\\n    Keil acknowledged it many years ago. He wrote of the high priestly line of\\n    Aaron, “[YLD, the Hebrew word for “beget/bear] in the genealogical lists\\n    may express mediate procreation, and the grandson may be introduced as\\nbegotten by the grandfather.”    <a href=\"#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\" title=\"\">[2]</a> Keil is using the word\\n    “mediate” in contrast to “immediate” such as “the immediate offspring of.”\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong><u>To Beget/To Bear</u></strong>\\n    -other examples: Deuteronomy 4:25 and Isaiah 39:7 quoted in II Kings 20:18\\n    (speaks of sons born to Hezekiah but these sons were born generations\\n    later, not the immediate sons born to him or even his grandsons or great\\n    grandsons).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong><u>Father.</u></strong>\\n    Use of the noun <em>father</em> in a broad sense:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    You shall…[say], “A wandering Aramean was my father.

In the broad sense\\n    of the word “father,” every descendant of Jacob could call him “father.”\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    How did this happen? At the age of 74 Jacob left his home in Canaan with\\n    just a staff and journeyed some 500 miles north to live with his uncle\\n    Laban in the land of Aram. Twenty years later he made his way back to\\n    Canaan with four wives and twelve named children.

Nevertheless, David is called their father. King\\n    Hezekiah urged his subjects to turn from the wicked deeds of their fathers\\n    which included generations of departure from the feasts prescribed in the\\n    Law of Moses. Four times the term “father” refers either in part or\\n    entirely to those who were separated by at least one generation from their\\n    immediate father.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong><u>Father</u></strong>\\n    referring to the original patriarchs of the Jewish people:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    See, I have set the land before you.

These Patriarchs are\\n    called the peoples’ fathers. In the strict sense, a person can have only\\n    one father. Yet here even Abraham’s idolatrous father Terah is called their\\n    father. Clearly “father” is used in the broad sense here. As in the case of\\n    “son” referring to the entire nation, no one questions this use of “father”\\n    as it occurs so frequently. Why then should it be surprising that “father”\\n    when applied to a single “son” could also be used in a broad sense?\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong><u>Father</u></strong>\\n    used in a broad sense even for non-Jewish peoples:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>\\n    <strong>\\n        King Belshazzar…. <sup>2</sup>Nebuchadnezzar his father….

Aaron, the founder of this family,\\n    lived around 1500 BC. This example comes from the time of Nehemiah, about\\n    500 BC where the priest is called “the son of Aaron.” Obviously, the priest\\n    was a distant descendant of Aaron.

God said Israel had sinned; they had transgressed His covenant. The\\n    guilty party was to be found and executed. God gave three levels of search:\\n    tribe, clan and household. In the morning each tribe was to be presented.\\n    The tribe that was taken would come by clan. The clan that was taken would\\n    come by household. The household that was taken would come by individual\\n    soldier (Joshua 7:14-ESV).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Joshua did as God commanded. When the tribes passed, Judah was taken.

When the\\n    households of that clan passed, the household of Zabdi was taken.\\n    Eventually the soldier named Achan was taken. He confessed and was\\n    executed. Altogether the clans of Judah numbered 76,500 soldiers according\\n    to Numbers 26:22. Yet the passage calls Achan the son of Zerah even though\\n    he was just one of thousands of soldiers in that clan. The writer knew\\n    this. He did not make a mistake. He clearly gave the basic descent of\\n    Achan, beginning with his tribe, clan, and household as was the custom\\n    before skipping down to his father and him saying, “Achan, the son of\\n    Carmi, the son of Zabdi, son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken”\\n    (Joshua 7:18).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong><u>Son</u></strong>\\n    -other examples of the broad use: Exodus 12:35, 37 (“son” translated\\n    “people”); Numbers 26:5-40, 32:40, 41; Joshua 5:3, 17:6; II Samuel 9:9-10\\n    (twice); I Chronicles 6:44, 50; II Chronicles 29:12-14, 29:21, 31:19,\\n    35:14-15-3x; Ezra 2:1-14, 3:10; Nehemiah 10:39; 11:4-9, 22-24; 12:23, 47.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong><u>Daughter</u></strong>\\n    <strong>.</strong>\\n    Use of the noun <em>daughter</em> in a broad sense:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    None of the daughters of Israel shall be a cult prostitute.

The second Caleb offered Achsah, his immediate daughter as a wife\\n    to the warrior who could capture the city of Debir. So Achsah was the\\n    immediate daughter of Caleb the spy who lived at the time of the conquest\\n    of Canaan, but a distant descendant of the first Caleb, the one in I Chron.\\n    2:49, who lived early in the Egyptian captivity.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong><u>Daughter</u></strong>\\n    -further examples of the broad sense: Genesis 24:48; 29:12; Joshua 17:6.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong><u>Brother</u></strong>\\n    used in the broad sense of a close friend:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan….

Joshua 17:3-4.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Hepher had at least three sons. The one named Zelophehad had only\\n    daughters.

Moses\\n    inquired of the LORD and was told to establish a law to the effect that if\\n    a family only had daughters, for the sake of the man’s name, his\\n    inheritance would go his daughters.

Genesis 46:5-8, 12, 21, 26.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Genesis 46:7 states that Jacob “brought all his offspring with him into\\n    Egypt.” Each offspring is named and counted. Yet some were not yet born.\\n    These unborn offspring could have been born up to 40 years after the move.\\n    They were grandsons and possibly even great grandsons. The list includes\\n    not only Perez but his two sons—Hezron and Hamul (Genesis 46:20). Since\\n    Perez himself was just born or maybe not yet quite born when they moved,\\n    his two sons would not be born until Jacob’s family had been living in\\n    Egypt 20-30 years. We might think the writer was deceptive to include\\n    unborn children in the list, but that is because we are judging by the way\\n    we look at genealogies. What was important to God was to establish the\\n    forefathers of the sons of Israel in the minds of the Jewish people.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Benjamin was born after Simeon and Levi massacred the men of Shechem. God\\n    told Jacob to move his family to Bethel. From there they moved to Isaac at\\n    Mamre (Hebron) and along the way, near Bethlehem, Rachel died giving birth\\n    to Benjamin. Twenty-four years later Jacob moved his family to Egypt, and\\n    in the Genesis 46:21 list of those who moved to Egypt are ten sons for\\n    Benjamin. While some may have been a scribal error, the rest most likely\\n    were still in the loins of their father. We must conclude that some were\\n    Benjamin’s grandsons, even though they are found in that list of Jacob’s\\n    offspring that he took to Egypt.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Naming and counting unborn children seems strange to us until we realize\\n    that the primary purpose of the genealogies was to bind a nation together\\n    by blood. Genealogies identified the members of the nation and gave them a\\n    powerful glue that is the marvel of the world to this day. No other nation\\n    ceased to exist for two millennia and then came back to life as Israel did\\n    in 1948. Naming both born and unborn descendants provided a registry from\\n    which the clans of Israel developed. Apparently, it was important to have a\\n    foundation of names in the registry from the beginning of the sojourn in\\n    Egypt. Only God could devise a system that would last nearly four\\n    millennia.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong><u>Undercounting of daughters</u></strong>\\n    :\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The passage says Jacob took “his daughters” to Egypt. Yet only one\\n    immediate daughter, Dinah, is listed and counted in the offspring total of\\n    66. On the other hand, neither Jacob’s four wives nor any of his sons’\\n    wives and only one granddaughter are counted in the family total of 70 that\\n    ended up in Egypt. Stephen has been faulted for saying that “Joseph sent\\n    and summoned Jacob his father and all his kindred, seventy-five persons in\\n    all” (Acts 7:14). Since the party included his four wives, his unnamed\\n    daughters and his sons’ unnamed daughters, who is to condemn some Rabbi\\n    whose Bible study Stephen attended who counted Jacob’s party using\\n    different criteria and found the total to be 75, not the 66 number of\\n    Genesis 46:26?\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>\\n        <u>Ancestors participating in the actions of descendants:</u>\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p class=\\'verse\\'>\\n    <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>\\n    <strong>\\n        So the field of Ephron in Machpelah, which was to the east of Mamre,\\n        the field with the cave…was made over <sup>18</sup>to Abraham as a\\n        possession in the presence of the Hittites...

From the tribe of Judah is Jerahmeel’s\\n    list of twenty-three generations beginning with Perez and ending sometime\\n    in the Period of the Judges. Judah raised two successive families. The\\n    second was by his Canaanite daughter-in-law Tamar who bore him the twins,\\n    Zerah and Perez. The only noted descendant of Zerah was Achan, the trouble\\n    maker of Israel. But many famous descendants came from the other twin,\\n    Perez, including King David, Caleb the believing spy, Bezelel who was the\\n    chief artisan on the Tabernacle and the Lord Jesus Christ. Perez also had\\n    two sons, Hezron and Hamul. The famous people mentioned above all came\\n    through Hezron who fathered three sons: Jerahmeel, Ram and Chelubai\\n    (Caleb). Jerahmeel’s list records 23 consecutive generations extending from\\n    the beginning of the Egyptian sojourn until about 200 years before David.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong><u>Complete genealogy of Jerahmeel</u></strong>\\n    <strong> </strong>\\n    (23 consecutive generations-numbering in brackets):\\n</p>\\n<p class=\\'verse\\'>\\n    <sup>25</sup>\\n[Perez-1; Hezron-2] The sons of Jerahmeel [3], the firstborn of Hezron….    <sup>26</sup>Jerameel also had another wife, whose name was Atarah; she was\\n    the mother of Onam [4]. <sup>28</sup>The sons of Onam: Shammai [5] and\\n    Jada. The sons of Shammai: Nadab [6] and Abishur. <sup>30</sup>The sons of\\n    Nadab: Seled and Appaim [7]. <sup>31</sup>The son of Appaim: Ishi [8]. The\\n    son of Ishi: Sheshan [9]. The son of Sheshan: Ahlai [10-actually Ahlai is\\n    Sheshan’s daughter]. <sup>34</sup>Now Sheshan had no sons, only daughters,\\n    but Sheshan had an Egyptian slave whose name was Jarha. <sup>35</sup>So\\n    Sheshan gave his daughter in marriage to Jarha his slave, and she bore him\\n    Attai [11]. <sup>36</sup>Attai fathered Nathan [12], and Nathan fathered\\n    Zabad [13]. <sup>37</sup>Zabad fathered Ephlal [14], and Ephlal fathered\\n    Obed [15]. <sup>38</sup>Obed fathered Jehu [16], and Jehu fathered Azariah\\n    [17]. <sup>39</sup>Azariah fathered Helez [18], and Helez fathered Eleasah\\n    [19]. <sup>40</sup>Eleasah fathered Sismai [20], and Sismai fathered\\n    Shallum [21]. <sup>41</sup>Shallum fathered Jekamiah [22], and Jekamiah\\n    fathered Elishama [23]. I Chron. 2:25-26, 31, 34-37, 39-41.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Although Jerahmeel had no significant descendants, no less than seventeen\\n    verses of Scripture are devoted to them. Why? He was Hezron’s firstborn.\\n    Time and again the firstborn is featured in the Old Testament merely\\n    because he was the firstborn. Apparently be cause so many famous people\\n    came from Hezron, the historian felt obligated to give all the information\\n    he had on Hezron’s firstborn even though he had no famous descendants.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Jerahmeel’s longest string has 23 descendants, finally concluding well into\\n    the period of the Judges. By comparison, the line of Ram, Hezron’s second\\n    eldest, reaches all the way from Perez to King David with just ten names.\\n    Because Jerahmeel’s line ends somewhere in the middle of the Judges, about\\n    eight more names would need to be added to reach to David’s birth. Clearly,\\n    many individuals are left out in the Perez-Ram-David line which will be\\n    examined in the next chapter.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    About 40 names are found in Jerahmeel’s listing (I Chronicles 2:25-41).\\n    Because it takes some doing to separate out the 23 generations that appear\\n    to be continuous, the following commentary is provided. Jacob fathered\\n    Judah, his fourth son, who fathered Perez. Judah was about 45 years old\\n    when his father moved the family to Egypt (1876 BC). Perez could not have\\n    been born much before the time of this move (if he were even born before\\n    this move) since he and his twin brother Zerah were born after Judah had\\n    grown from birth in Haran to adulthood in Shechem, had fathered three sons\\n    who also grew to adulthood and two had died by the judgment of God, all in\\n    those 45 years. Thus, the birth of Tamar’s twins, Zerah and Perez, had to\\n    have occurred very close to that move to Egypt in 1876 BC and thus is a\\n    convenient way to count generations, not only the 23 of Jerahmeel’s line,\\n    but those leading to Caleb, David, Bezelel and Christ as well, all starting\\n    at 1876 BC. For convenience the 23 generations are listed below without\\n    verse notations:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    1-Perez; 2-Hezron; 3-Jerahmeel; 4-Onam; 5-Shammai; 6-Nadab; 7-Appaim;\\n    8-Ishi; 9-Sheshan who had no sons, only daughters, one of whom he gave to\\n    his Egyptian slave Jarha; 10-Ahlai, daughter of Sheshan first called his\\n    son then explained that she was really his daughter but that he had no\\n    sons; 11-Attai; 12-Nathan; 13-Zabad; 14-Ephlal; 15-Obed; 16-Jehu (whom we\\n    suggest was in the Exodus generation); 17-Azariah; 18-Helez; 19-Eleasah;\\n    20-Sismai; 21-Shallum; 22-Jekamiah; 23-Elishama. I Chronicles 2:25-41.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Most lists have difficulties and Jerahmeel’s is no exception. The greatest\\n    difficulty here is determining when it ends historically. Scripturally, the\\n    list ends with “and Jekamiah fathered Elishama” (I Chronicles 2:41) before\\n    moving on to “The sons of Caleb the younger brother of Jerahmeel…” in the\\n    next verse. Does this list extend through the Judges or even through the\\n    kings to the Captivity? The text doesn’t say.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    One observation is that the genealogies coming at the beginning of\\n    Chronicles seem to focus on Israel’s earlier history. The one strong clue\\n    is that the ninth name, Sheshan, had an Egyptian slave whom he gave to his\\n    daughter to carry on his name since he had no sons. When during the\\n    430-year Egyptian sojourn might the Israelites have been so prosperous and\\n    free as to own slaves who were Egyptian in nationality before the Hebrews\\n    themselves were reduced to slavery? It needed to be before they became so\\n    numerous as to be a threat to Egypt.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    During the years of famine Joseph managed the transfer of the land to\\n    Pharaoh, thereby greatly strengthening Pharaoh’s office. Pharaoh showed his\\n    gratitude by favoring Joseph and his family with some of Egypt’s best\\n    grazing land in the northeast of the Nile delta. Gradually Egypt declined\\n    and eventually the northern portion was overrun by the famous Hyksos\\n    people. They, like the Hebrews, were of Semitic stock. The Hyksos needed\\n    allies among the defeated Egyptians, so Israel most likely enjoyed a\\n    measure of freedom under them. Most likely it was during that period that\\n    Sheshan gave his daughter Ahlai, who is called “his son” in verse 31, to\\n    his Egyptian slave Jarha. This marriage occurs in the tenth generation of\\n    Perez through Jerahmeel. At this point in history we estimate that new\\n    generations were beginning about every 25 years so the daughter Ahlai would\\n    have been born about 250 years into the Egyptian sojourn or 180 years\\n    before the Exodus.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Sometime later stronger Pharaohs of the eighteenth dynasty arose who drove\\n    out the Hyksos. At that point the Hebrews would have been deemed a threat\\n    so they were put to servitude. Shortly thereafter Princess Hatshepsut,\\n    daughter of Thutmose I, found and adopted Moses. Hatshepsut went on to\\n    control or rule Egypt for nearly a quarter of a century, first on behalf of\\n    her sickly husband, Thutmose II, and then on behalf of his infant son,\\n    Thutmose III, by a court woman. Thutmose III is said to have been about\\n    twenty-two years old when he finally wrestled the throne from his\\n    step-mother. He proved to be a powerful Pharaoh who extended the rule of\\n    Egypt all the way to the Euphrates.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    At the age of 40 Moses had to flee when he killed the Egyptian because\\n    Thutmose III would use this crime as a way of removing his rival Moses. Dr.\\n    Merrill points out that this Pharaoh is the only one to rule Egypt for\\n    forty years until Ramses II who ruled 200 years later and therefore the\\n    only Pharaoh to fit the timeline of Moses during a considerable stretch of\\n    Egyptian history.<a href=\"#_ftn4\" name=\"_ftnref4\" title=\"\">[4]</a> God kept\\n    Moses in the wilderness forty years until the next pharaoh, Amenhotep II,\\n    succeeded Thutmose III.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Returning to our timeline, if Sheshan’s slave is correctly dated, the 15th\\n    or 16<sup>th</sup> generations of Jerahmeel would be the generation that\\n    left Egypt in the Exodus. That leaves the final seven or eight generations\\n    for the first half of the 480 period from the Exodus until Solomon’s\\n    Temple. Thus, Jarehmeel’s line falls about eight generations short of\\n    Solomon’s reign or seven of David’s. Dr. Keil generally supports this view,\\n    being of the opinion that Jerahmeel’s line ended somewhere near the end of\\n    the period of the Judges.<a href=\"#_ftn5\" name=\"_ftnref5\" title=\"\">[5]</a>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    In conclusion the line of Jerahmeel seems to indicate that about 30\\n    generations are involved in the time from the beginning of the Egyptian\\n    sojourn and the birth of Perez until the beginning of Solomon’s reign.\\n    These 30 generations cover a period of some 906 years (1876-970=906).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong><u>Complete genealogy of Heman</u></strong>\\n    <strong> </strong>\\n    (19 consecutive generations-numbering in brackets):\\n</p>\\n<p class=\\'verse\\'>\\n    <sup>31</sup>\\n    These are the men whom David put in charge of the service of song in the\\n    house of the LORD after the ark rested there. <sup>33</sup>Of the sons of\\n    the Kohathites: Heman [1] the singer the son of Joel [2], son of Samuel\\n    [3], <sup>34</sup>son of Elkanah [4], son of Jeroham [5], son of Eliel [6],\\n    son of Toah [7], <sup>35</sup>son of Zuph [8], son of Elkanah [9], son of\\n    Mahath [10], son of Amasai [11], <sup>36</sup>son of Elkanah [12], son of\\n    Joel [13], son of Azariah [14], son of Zephaniah [15], <sup>37</sup>son of\\nTahath [16], son of Assir [17], son of Ebiasaph [18], son of Korah [19],    <sup>38</sup>son of Izhar, son of Kohath, son of Levi, son of Israel. I\\n    Chron. 6:31, 33-38.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Our second example of a complete genealogy provides what the first did\\n    not—a precise ending point as well as a precise starting point. When Jacob\\n    took his family to Egypt, his third son Levi came with his three sons\\n    Gershon, Kohath and Merari. Eventually they multiplied into a large tribe.\\n    Each of the sons formed a clan. God gave the clans of Levi to assist Aaron\\n    for the ministry of the Tabernacle. Seven hundred years later Samuel and\\n    even later David organized the Levites for ministry. After bringing the Ark\\n    to Jerusalem David appointed one person from each clan to be a worship\\n    leader at the Tabernacle. In the center Heman was to lead the Kohathite\\n    singers. On his right Asaph would lead the Gershonite singers. On his left\\n    hand Ethan was to direct the Merari singers.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    To have had this heavy responsibility Heman needed to be a mature man at\\n    the time of his appointment. In fact, his own family all but filled the\\n    choir loft. I Chronicles 25:5 reports that God gave Heman fourteen sons and\\n    three daughters who were all under the direction of their father’s musical\\n    work in the house of the LORD. Yet he not only served in David’s day but\\n    lived to serve in Solomon’s day as well. David brought the Ark to Jerusalem\\n    after his first seven years of rule in Hebron which began about 1010 BC. So\\n    Heman was maybe slightly older than David; 1000 BC is certainly a ballpark\\n    ending point for Heman’s genealogy. But where did it begin? Actually it\\n    began with Jacob but what grabs our attention is the name Korah. Korah was\\n    the leader of the rebellion against the leadership of Moses and Aaron and\\n    becomes the reason the story of Heman is so touching.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The story begins shortly after that first year of law-giving in the\\n    wilderness so it could be dated to about 1444 BC. God strongly guarded both\\n    the spiritual things of Israel under Aaron and the civil authority under\\n    Moses. The severity of punishment for violating those institutions is well\\n    known. A well-meaning man steadied the Ark during transport and God struck\\n    him dead. Anyone without authorization within the tabernacle grounds was to\\n    be put to death. Levites of the clan of Kohath and sons of Reuben found 250\\n    princes of Israel to join them to challenge the authority of Moses and\\n    Aaron and God struck them all dead (Numbers 16). The camp took the side of\\n    those slain so God sent a plague that consumed thousands. Only the\\n    intercession of Moses and Aaron stopped the plague. Eighteen generations\\n    later a descendant of this wicked man Korah became worship leader of the\\n    entire nation. What a story of mercy and grace.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The dates are known: the rebellion of Korah about 1444 BC and the Ark\\n    carried to Jerusalem about 1000 BC, a time span of nearly 450 years. The\\n    number of generations identified in the Heman list for this period is 19.\\n    But Aaron and Korah were in their 80’s while David and Heman were in their\\n    40’s, so one generation must be subtracted from Heman’s list. That leaves\\n    18 names. In counting the time from one generation to the next, begin\\n    counting with the second person. That leaves 17 names or 26.5 years per\\n    generation which is well in the ballpark for generations.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Now we must return to David’s list which will be discussed in chapter\\n    seven. It is found four times in the Bible, beginning with Ruth 4:18-22.\\n    That list gives ten names starting with the move to Egypt in 1876 BC. The\\n    first three names are those who lived at the beginning of the 430-years in\\n    Egypt-Perez, Hezron and Ram. Then it skips down 300 years to the time of\\n    the Exodus with three more names: Amminadab, Nahshon and Salmon. Amminadab\\n    was the elderly patriarch of Judah. His son, Nahshon was the Prince of\\n    Judah whom Moses asked to conduct the second census for Judah. Salmon\\n    married Rahab after the fall of Jericho. From that point to David is 400\\n    years yet only four names remain in David’s genealogy—Boaz, Obed, Jesse and\\n    David. If there were no omitted generations, that list would represent 100\\n    years per generation. The Heman list not only shows us what a complete\\n    genealogy would look like from the Exodus to the time of worship in\\n    Jerusalem but it also shows that the David list is abbreviated.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Finally, the Heman list omits 8-12 generations during the Egyptian sojourn\\n    just like the Aaron list did. It begins with Jacob, then Levi, then Kohath,\\n    then Izhar, then Korah. Aaron’s list follows the same pattern:\\n    Jacob-Levi-Kohath-Amram-Aaron. The first three names in each list is the\\n    same. The difference comes with Kohath’s sons. Aaron descended from Amram,\\n    the first of Kohath’s sons while Korah descended from Izhar, the second of\\n    Kohath’s four sons. Kohath and his sons Amram and Izhar lived at the\\n    beginning of the sojourn in Egypt. Aaron and Korah were born 300 years\\n    later near the end of the Egyptian sojourn. The Heman list follows the\\n    pattern of and therefore confirms Aaron’s list by skipping 8-12 generations\\n    between Izhar and Korah just like the Aaron list skipped 8-12 generations\\n    between Amram and Aaron.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Heman’s list is ascending, moving back through time from son to father. We\\n    will reverse it to view it the usual way (descending from father to son).\\n    We have removed Heman’s three forefathers (Levi-Kohath-Izhar) which we\\n    spoke of above:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    1-Korah; 2-Ebiasaph; 3-Assir; 4-Tahath; 5-Zephaniah; 6-Azariah; 7-Joel;\\n    8-Elkanah; 9-Amasai; 10-Mahath; 11-Elkanah; 12-Zuph; 13-Toah; 14-Eliel;\\n    15-Jeroham; 16-Elkanah; 17-Samuel; 18-Joel; 19-Heman.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Defenders of the 215-year view see such numbers and are forced to devise a\\n    scheme that harmonizes the numbers, oblivious to the nature and purpose of\\n    Hebrew genealogies. For example, one book says that Judah’s first two sons\\n    had children when they were 14 or 15 years old and Judah’s twins, Zerah and\\n    Perez, likewise had sons when they were still teenagers. Then to bridge the\\n    huge time span from that son to Bezalel, it suggests that each of the next\\n    fathers, Hezron, Caleb and Hur had their firstborns when they were in their\\n    sixties. Then to bridge the next brief time span, with a straight face this\\n    interpreter says the next generations had their sons when they were 20\\n    years old. The Korah-Heman list assures us that the Hebrew generations\\n    during those centuries were within the range of reason, in this case\\n    averaging 26 years per generation.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Along the line of developing a story to fit misinterpreted numbers, another\\n    writer explained how four generations produced the six hundred thousand men\\n    found in the first census after the Exodus. The writer said it was simple.\\n    Each father had many sons, an average of like six sons per father per\\n    generation. In contrast with this speculation the record tells a different\\n    story. For every male that had six or more sons there was one that died\\n    early or didn’t even marry or didn’t have children or had just one or two\\n    sons.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The other two lines of temple musicians are listed in I Chronicles 6 as\\n    well. However, they do not provide the same measure of certainty as the\\n    line of Heman. His line parallels Aaron’s line for both his and Aaron’s\\n    line give the first three generations living in Egypt, then skip down to\\n    the individual in their line who was an older adult at the time of the\\n    Exodus—Aaron and Korah. But in the case of Asaph and Ethan, we cannot\\n    identify the individual in their line who was contemporary with Aaron and\\n    Korah and thus their lines have no clear starting point. Both Ethan’s and\\n    Asaph’s lines become suspect to abbreviation.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>\\n        <u>\\n            In summary this chapter uncovered the following characteristics of\\n            Hebrew lines:\\n        </u>\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    1. The biblical genealogies are elegant, profound, mysterious, practical,\\n    personal and flexible in nature.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    2. Genealogies told the Hebrew who he was and where he belonged. They were\\n    a major element in organizing Israel both in the wilderness camp and in\\n    settling Canaan.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    3. The simplicity of Hebrew names requires great care in tracing lists. For\\n    the most part only a single name is given for an individual though several\\n    different names might be used for the same individual in different places.\\n    Some names were very popular so many people were known by the same name.\\n    People were given the names of famous ancestors. (In the English it is\\n    sometimes even hard to tell if a name is male or female.)\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    4. Biblical Hebrew contains only basic relational terms such as father,\\n    son, daughter, brother and beget. The same word could be used for immediate\\n    connections such as a father and his immediate son or more distant\\n    connections from ancestor to descendant or from descendant to ancestor.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    5. When the biblical text is read these elements appear in all their\\n    complexity. The company of people who moved to Egypt included the names of\\n    unborn sons. A daughter is even called a son. In the same verse a man is\\n    called the son of both his father and grandfather. I Chronicles 4:1 speaks\\n    of the sons of Judah then gives five names—one was a son, one was a\\n    grandson, two were great grandsons and one was a descendant who lived 400\\n    years later.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    6. Scripture provides two apparently complete and lengthy lists—those of\\n    Jerahmeel and Heman. When David’s list is compared with those lists, it is\\n    found to be greatly abbreviated. For instance, during the same time frame\\n    that Jerahmeel’s list contains twenty-three names and Heman’s list contains\\n    19 names, David’s list contains six names. These comparisons help us to see\\n    that David’s genealogy is greatly condensed. Our next chapter will present\\n    14 examples of abbreviated genealogies including several already\\n    introduced. The chapter after that will address the most contentious of all\\n    genealogies, that of Shem.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    7. All these examples were correct uses of the Hebrew in the day they were\\n    recorded. They all reflect the inerrancy and infallibility of Scripture.\\n    However, they require that the student of Scripture be sensitive to the\\n    language in which they were written and understand these lists in terms of\\n    the language of that day, not the language of our day.\\n    <br clear=\"all\"/>\\n</p>\\n<div>\\n    <br clear=\"all\"/>\\n    <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"/>\\n    <div id=\"ftn1\">\\n        <p>\\n            <a href=\"#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\" title=\"\">[1]</a>\\n            Abarim Publications online Biblical Hebrew Dictionary.

At first this idea is unsettling, but as we\\n    set aside the typical idea of how genealogical lists work and allow our\\n    minds to interact with the Scriptures themselves, we will conclude that,\\n    indeed, Hebrew genealogies often left out unnecessary or unknown names.\\n    Several benefits are immediately apparent. Abbreviating genealogies made\\nthem more efficient and decidedly less tedious. Many examples follow.    <a name=\\\"__DdeLink__5772_1878803623\\\"></a>See the Appendix for a table to\\n    illustrate each example (6.01-6.16).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    All Hebrews descended from one of Jacob's twelve sons. The name of each son\\n    became a tribe so all descendants were members of one of the tribes. Each\\n    tribe received a portion of the Promised Land with one exception. But a\\n    slight complication solved it. Jacob adopted Joseph's two sons so when\\n    Joseph is removed from his 11 brothers and his two sons replace him, Israel\\n    had 13 tribes, not 12. But God assigned the tribe of Levi to minister to\\n    the spiritual needs of Israel. That tribe did not fight in the army and it\\n    did not have its own portion of the land. Rather it was scattered\\n    throughout the other twelve tribes. As a result, one might think of Israel\\n    as having twelve normal tribes and one special tribe.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Each of the 13 \\\"tribes\\\" was further broken down into \\\"clans\\\" as the tribe's\\n    population grew. In time each \\\"clan\\\" was further broken down into\\n    \\\"households.\\\" Population counts usually involved only adult males. Tribes\\n    numbered from 25,000-75,000 adult males; clans numbered from thousands to\\n    tens of thousands; households numbered from hundreds to thousands. The\\n    genealogies of those who descended from Jacob usually began with those\\n    three levels of division-tribe, clan and household. If the individual was\\n    well known, the fourth name would be that of the individual to whom the\\n    genealogy belonged.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    This chapter comes in two versions. First it will skirt the sometimes\\n    overwhelming detail and summarize each example. Then it will present the\\n    list of examples with all their details which include important stories.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Example 1-Aaron </strong>\\n    . Since Aaron was well known just four names expressed his genealogy:\\n    Levi-Kohath-Amram-Aaron (Exodus 6:16-20). Levi was his tribal ancestor;\\n    Kohath was his clan ancestor and Amram was his household ancestor. In this\\n    way his genealogy names three immediate individuals that began his line and\\n    lived at the beginning of the 430-year sojourn in Egypt then skips down\\n    about 300 years or 8-12 generations to him. Thus, the four names represent\\n    12-16 successive fathers.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>\\n        Examples 2-7-Korah, Dathan, Abiram, On, Achan and Zelophehad's\\n        daughters.\\n    </strong>\\n    Each follows the pattern of Aaron's line with minor exceptions when needed.\\n    Korah, Dathan and Abiram were well known their list follows the pattern of\\n    Aaron's list: tribe, clan, household and individual. On was apparently less\\n    important among the rebels so only his tribe, clan and name are given.\\n    Achan was not widely known so his father, Carmi, is added. The daughters of\\n    Zelophehad were also not widely known, so their grandfather as well as\\n    their father were added.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    When stories are included we can see that genealogies are far more than\\n    lists of names. They are historical references to key events and\\n    individuals in the life of the nation divided by timelines and\\n    circumstances. We learn of its struggles, heroes and villains. We learn how\\n    God worked through His people in relationship to their calling as a nation\\n    with its tribes, clans and households. He blessed them; but held them\\n    responsible for their disobedience.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Examples 8-9 </strong>\\n    (I Chronicles 7:20-27) are among the most complicated lists. These verses\\n    commemorate the lives of two outstanding individuals in the tribe that\\n    otherwise was notorious for dividing Israel, the tribe of Ephraim. The\\n    problem is that a descendant was named after the tribal father so only one\\n    continuous line is seen in this list when it actually contains two lines.\\n    The first list contains nine names beginning with Ephraim who was born\\n    shortly before 1876 BC and ends with the daughter of the second Ephraim.\\n    She was famous for founding or developing two major towns in Ephraim\\n    possibly 500 years later. In verse 25 the writer goes back to pick up\\n    another son of the Ephraim, grandson of Joseph and goes down to Joshua. It\\n    also contains nine generations. While listing nine generations, each of\\n    these lists still omits many generations.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Example 10</strong>\\n    features Caleb, the believing spy. He was so famous that Scripture does not\\n    give his genealogy so some may object that the Bible does not abbreviate\\n    his list. The objection is sound, but research gives so many names in his\\n    line that much of it can be reconstructed. However, because it still omits\\n    names it stands abbreviated as it is given piecemeal in the Pentateuch and\\n    Joshua.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Example 11-David</strong>\\n    . This is almost like presenting four examples because David's line is\\n    found four times in the Old and New Testaments. It is first found at the\\n    end of Ruth when she bears a son to Boaz. It begins with Perez who was one\\n    of the twins born to Judah about the time Jacob moved his tribe to Egypt\\n    (1876 BC) and concludes with David who died about 970 BC. If this list were\\n    complete each son would be born when his father was 90. Fortunately the\\n    names are familiar. In looking at it the first three lived early in the\\n    Egyptian sojourn. The next three lived over 300 years later at the time of\\n    the Exodus and conquest of Canaan. Then the list moves down to the end of\\n    the Judges to name three immediate forefathers of David and finally David\\n    himself.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Example 12</strong>\\n    -The Priesthood of Israel is different from other lists because it was\\n    oriented more to deaths than births. For instance, Eli, the high priest in\\n    the time of Samuel's youth held the office for 40 years when death removed\\n    him. As a result, in a way, while these are supposedly comprehensive lists,\\n    they are not genealogies. This example will give opportunity to explore\\n    this kind of list.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Example 13-Ezra the Priest</strong>\\n    . Ezra (7:1-5) omits six consecutive generations in his list when compared\\n    to the official list of priests in Chronicles. He had his reasons and they\\n    probably were not associated with efficiency or avoiding tediousness, but\\n    his list clearly omits six names and shows that skipping names in a\\n    genealogy was a common practice.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Examples 14 and 15--Temple Singers</strong>\\n    . David appointed Heman as senior choir director. Of course Heman was a\\n    descendant of Levi. He had both outstanding and shady ancestors. His\\n    grandfather was the prophet and judge, Samuel, but the infamous Korah was\\n    also in Heman's line. His line contains 19 names and is complete from Korah\\n    to himself. It spans the years from Korah who led the rebellion against\\n    Aaron and Moses in 1444 BC to his appointment by David about 1000 BC). In\\n    contrast to his complete list of 19 names, the genealogies of the two other\\n    choirmasters, Asaph and Ethan, are examples of incomplete lists. Asaph's\\n    line contains 12 names and Ethan's line contains 10.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Final Example-Example 16</strong>\\n    . Heman.\\n</p>\\n<h3 id='details-to-the-above-examples'>\\n    Details to the Above Examples: 1876-1406 BC\\n</h3>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Example 1 Details--Aaron</strong>\\n    .\\n</p>\\n<p class='verse'>\\n    <sup>57</sup>\\n    This was the list of the Levites according to their clans:&#8230; of\\n    Kohath, the clan of the Kohathites;&#8230; <sup>58</sup>And Kohath was the\\n    father of Amram. <sup>59</sup>The name of Amram's wife was Jochebed the\\n    daughter of Levi, who was born to Levi in Egypt. And she bore to Amram\\n    Aaron and Moses and Miriam their sister. Numbers 26:57-59.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Chapter one demonstrated beyond doubt that the Levi-Aaron genealogy of\\n    Exodus six and Numbers 26 is an abbreviated or condensed genealogy. It\\n    lists only Levi, his son Kohath and his grandson Amram before skipping down\\n    to Aaron. The list appears four times (Exodus 6:16-20; Numbers 26:57-59; I\\n    Chronicles 6:1-3; I Chronicles 23:6, 12-13), always with the same fathers\\n    and sons-Levi-Kohath-Amram-Aaron. Levi was the immediate father of Kohath,\\n    so Kohath was the immediate son of Levi; Kohath was the immediate father of\\n    Amram, so Amram was the immediate son of Kohath; however, Amram was not the\\n    immediate father of Aaron and Aaron was not the immediate son of Amram. Up\\n    to twelve generations are omitted between Amram and Aaron.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The text also adds numerous details about individuals in the list. Among\\n    them, the Exodus passage relates that Amram married a woman called Jochebed\\n    and that this woman was his father's sister and she bore him Moses as well\\n    as Aaron. The Numbers passage adds that she was the daughter of Levi born\\n    in Egypt and she bore him Miriam as well as Aaron and Moses. Since Amram\\n    was born in Egypt, he married an aunt who was about his age. His\\n    descendants, Aaron, Moses and Mariam would become central figures in the\\n    wilderness wanderings some four hundred years later. Lesson: many details\\n    can be added to an apparent immediate father-son listing even though\\n    numerous intermediate generations are skipped. The details relate to the\\n    first unborn son, not the named son/offspring.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    From the text alone the reader would never guess that Aaron, Moses and\\n    Miriam were separated from Amram and Jochebed by many generations. Moses,\\n    the writer, had no intention of deceiving his audience. People of that day\\n    knew their national history, so they knew he skipped generations. Moses\\n    correctly used Hebrew genealogies because their purpose was to knit a\\n    nation together. These three descendants of Levi had to be tightly bound to\\n    Jacob's lineage.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Examples 2-5 Details Summarized-Korah, Dathan, Abiram, On</strong>\\n    . Nearly half of all the Old Testament verses containing genealogies relate\\n    to the tribes of Levi and Judah. This makes sense since God chose the tribe\\n    of Levi to minister to Israel's spiritual life and the tribe of Judah to\\n    supply its rulers and the Savior. In Example #1 (Levi-Aaron) three\\n    generations were used to establish a line from the tribal founder, Levi, to\\n    the individual under consideration, Aaron. The organizational plan Moses\\n    followed was: first level, the tribe of Levi; second level, the clan of\\n    Kohath (Levi's son); third level, the household level of Amram (Levi's\\n    grandson).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    As an aside, level two, the clan level, is identified by several different\\n    titles in various parts of the Old Testament. Consequently, some modern\\n    authors refer to it as the division level. Scripture also uses several\\n    terms interchangeably for the third level so some authors call this third\\n    level the clan level. For sake of clarity, we will call the first level the\\n    tribe level, the second level the clan level and the third level the\\n    household level.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    A refinement that might be overlooked involves counting generations. In a\\n    list each person represents a generation. But when determining changes\\n    between generations, it takes two generations to produce a change. Thus,\\n    one must count from the birth of the first to the birth of the second as\\n    one generation. When working with averages, the average number of years in\\na generation must be determined. Because the length of generations varied,    <em>Hidden Beauty</em> visits this subject multiple times.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Also, one cannot presume that the firstborn is always the chosen successor.\\n    Judah was the fourth born of Jacob yet the royal line of Israel was\\n    established through him, not Reuben, Jacob's firstborn. Aaron's third born,\\n    Eleazar, carried on the line of the high priesthood. Even further, one's\\n    firstborn might be a female as in the case of Mariam being the oldest child\\n    of the unnamed parents of Mariam, Aaron and Moses. In counting Aaron's\\n    children only four males are named. The law of averages would suggest he\\n    had daughters as well. If he had four daughters and four sons and they\\n    alternated-female, male-his designated heir, Eleazar, would have been his\\n    fifth child. Thus, we estimate Aaron's age as 30 when Eleazar was born\\n    rather than 25 when he would have begun fathering children.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    As to the length of a generation, 25 is used for an average during this\\n    period. It began when Jacob's sons started to have children. Chapter seven\\n    explains that human longevity declined 2-8 years per generation from the\\n    Flood to the death of Moses. Paralleling this decline, the start of new\\n    generations declined. In the list of Genesis 11 new generations began every\\n    29-35 years. By the time Jacob's sons began having families, new\\n    generations were starting every 19-28 years. Unusual circumstances, such as\\n    Joseph's imprisonment resulting in his first son arriving when he was about\\n    36, are noted but not considered average.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Numbers 16:1-2 contains four examples of abbreviated genealogies-Korah,\\n    Dathan, Abiram and On. Korah was of the tribe of Levi while Dathan, Abiram\\n    and On were of the tribe of Reuben. The lists of Korah and of Dathan and\\n    Abiram will be examined next. The writer gave the tribe, clan and household\\n    identities of the first three, but omitted the household to which On\\n    belonged. In this way the On listing is the shortest list on record.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Example 2 Details-Korah</strong>\\n    .\\n</p>\\n<p class='verse'>\\n    <sup>1</sup>\\n    Now Korah the son of Izhar, son of Kohath, son of Levi, and Dathan and\\n    Abiram the sons of Eliab, and On the son of Peleth [Pallu], sons of Reuben,\\n    took men. <sup>2</sup>And they rose up before Moses, with a number of the\\n    people of Israel, 250 chiefs of the congregation, chosen from the assembly,\\n    well-known men. Numbers 16:1-2.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The genealogy of Korah follows the basic pattern of tribe, clan and\\n    household. Numbers 16:1 tells that Korah, like Aaron, was a descendant of\\n    Levi. Further, like Aaron he was from the Levite clan of Kohath. But\\n    whereas Aaron traced his line through Kohath's oldest son Amram, Korah\\n    traced his line through Kohath's second son Izhar. However, merely\\n    discussing names without faces and actions doesn't grasp the mind like\\n    associating names with specific events. So here is the background.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Korah got others to join him in challenging the leadership of Aaron and\\n    Moses. He envied the honor and privileges of Aaron's position as high\\n    priest. He found sons of Reuben who were equally envious of Moses (tribe of\\n    Levi) who exercised supreme authority in civil affairs. After all, Reuben\\n    was the oldest son of Jacob, not Levi. Traditionally, family leadership was\\n    the right of the firstborn. Two brothers controlling the entire nation had\\n    to be changed. They found 250 princes of Israel to join their uprising.\\n    This delegation marched on the Tent of Meeting to confront Aaron and Moses,\\n    undoubtedly accompanied by an unruly mob of supporters.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    With indignation this horde threw down their challenge: \\\"Why do you exalt\\n    yourselves above the assembly of the LORD?\\\" (Numbers 16:3). What they\\n    forgot was that God had chosen the nation's leaders. In the end God opened\\n    up the earth to swallow the rebel instigators and fire consumed the 250\\n    princes. Those 250 princes ranked among the celebrities of the nation. The\\n    next day the entire congregation grumbled against Aaron and Moses, blaming\\n    them for getting their princes killed. God sent a plague. Only the quick\\n    intervention of Aaron and Moses prevented the loss of the entire nation. As\\n    it was, the plague took the lives of 14,700 people in just hours. The\\n    divinely sent plague abruptly ended the rebellion.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Numbers 16:1 abbreviates Korah's genealogy. It lists the first three\\n    generations of the Patriarch Jacob's third son-Levi, Kohath and Izhar-and\\n    then skips down 300 years to Korah. When Jacob moved his family to Egypt\\n    (1876 BC), Levi was about 46 years old while his son Kohath's was an\\n    estimated 20. Thus, Kohath's sons, Amram and Izhar, belonged to the first\\n    generation born in Egypt. Like Aaron and Moses, Korah was born over 300\\n    years and up to 12 generations later.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Examples 3-5 Details-Dathan, Abiram, On.</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p class='verse'>\\n    <sup>5</sup>\\n    Reuben, the firstborn of Israel; the sons of Reuben: of Hanoch, the clan of\\n    the Hanochites; of Pallu, the clan of the Palluites; <sup>6</sup>of Hezron,\\nthe clan of the Hezronites; of Carmi, the clan of the Carmites.    <sup>7</sup>These are the clans of the Reubenites, and those listed were\\n    43,730. <sup>8</sup>And the sons of Pallu: Eliab. <sup>9</sup>The sons of\\n    Eliab: Nemuel, Dathan, and Abiram.

These men were born in the\\n    tribe of Reuben, Jacob's firstborn. Due to their role of leaders in the\\n    notorious attack on Moses they are also singled out in the second census of\\n    Israel found in Numbers 26 (above). Whereas the Numbers 26 census mostly\\n    lists tribes and clans, in the case of the tribe of Reuben, the census\\n    includes four verses on one household of the Pallu clan, the household of\\n    Elias (verses 8-11). Then the census tells that Dathan and Abiram were sons\\n    of Elias, ie, were descendants of the household of Elias. Without the\\n    identification of their household, we would only know their tribe and clan.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Reuben was about 48 when they moved to Egypt. Pallu would have been about\\n    20 since he is listed second among Reuben's four sons. Elias is not listed\\n    among those who went down to Egypt, so he would have been the first of his\\n    line born in Egypt. Dathan and Abiram were born over 350 years after the\\n    birth of Elias. This notice follows the pattern of listing three\\n    consecutive generations then skipping down to the individual under\\n    discussion. In doing so it passes over up to 13 generations in the same way\\n    the genealogies of Aaron and Korah passed over up to 12 generations.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    On is only named in Numbers 16 which records this dangerous rebellion\\n    against Aaron and Moses. Like Dathan and Abiram, he was a member of the\\n    tribe of Reuben. His line is similar to theirs with one exception. Even his\\n    household is not given. This is probably due to the other two playing a\\n    greater role in attacking the leadership of Moses. The remaining names are\\n    simply Reuben (tribe)-Peleth/Pallau (clan)-On (individual). His list is\\n    abbreviated indeed.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Before tackling more complicated condensed or abbreviated genealogies,\\n    Scripture gives four other genealogies that occur during this period-those\\n    of Achan, the daughters of Zelophehad, Joshua and Caleb. Each generally\\n    follows the pattern established above: tribe, clan and household. But\\n    further names are added to those who were unknown.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Example 6 Details--Achan</strong>\\n    .\\n</p>\\n<p class='verse'>\\n    But the people of Israel broke faith in regard to the devoted things for\\n    Achan the son of Carmi, son of Zabdi, son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah,\\n    took some of the devoted things. And the anger of the LORD burned against\\n    the people of Israel. Joshua 7:1.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Achan descended from Judah who raised twins after his first three sons were\\n    grown. Their names were well known; they formed two large clans in Israel.\\n    The more prominent twin, Perez, became the forefather of Caleb the spy,\\n    David and Jesus Christ. We will learn much of Perez's descendants. The\\n    lesser known twin was Zerah and from this son of Judah Achan descended. One\\n    of Zerah's sons was named Zabdi. He represents level three, the household\\n    level, in the organization of Israel.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The twins (Zerah and Perez) were born about the time Jacob moved his large\\n    family to Egypt so Zabdi would have been born 25-30 years later, say about\\n    1850 BC. Achan served with over 600,000 other sons of Israel in Joshua's\\n    army that destroyed Jericho. Thus, Achan would have been military age\\n    (between the ages of 20 and 50) at the time of Jericho's fall in 1406 BC.\\n    Because he had considerable livestock and a considerable family, he was\\n    more likely nearer 50 than 20, so he would have been born about 1450 BC or\\n    400 years after Zabdi was born (1850-1450=400).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Achan possessed oxen, donkeys and sheep as well as sons and daughters\\n    (Joshua 7:24). Possibly his lack of honesty had infected his entire\\n    household and had contributed to his prosperity. While the sons of Israel\\n    did not have first and last names, their father's name was sometimes given\\n    to help identify them. Since Achan was an obscure thief his immediate\\n    father, Carmi, was named. Carmi did not pass before Joshua and the priest,\\n    so most likely he belonged to the generation that died in the wilderness.\\n    If typical he would have been born 25-30 years (1480-1475 BC) before Achan.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    To summarize, three generations are used to locate Achan's place in Israel.\\n    They are immediate father-son generations (Judah-Zerah-Zabdi). Judah\\n    fathered Zerah who fathered Zabdi. Judah was the tribal father; Zerah\\n    formed one of the clans of Judah; Zabdi formed one of the households of\\n    Zerah. So Achan belonged to the tribe of Judah, the clan of Zerah and the\\n    household of Zabdi. About 400 years after the birth of Zabdi, Achan was\\n    born. Obviously, many generations came between Zabdi and Achan. We suggest\\n    12-16. Only one is mentioned, that of Carmi, Achan's immediate father. Due\\n    to the efficiency of Hebrew genealogies Achan's list is shortened by about\\n    two-thirds.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    It might be helpful at this point to make some observations about Old\\n    Testament names. Two men named Carmi are found during this period of\\n    Israel's history. The first was Reuben's fourth son, Carmi, who formed one\\n    of the four clans of the tribe that Dathan and Abiram belonged to. The\\n    second Carmi was Achan's father who lived four hundred years after the\\n    first Carmi and belonged to a different tribe. He is the Carmi in Joshua\\n    7:1 and is otherwise unknown.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Names were used over and over in Israel and are easy to confuse. The two\\n    famous Calebs in the line of Judah are a well-known example. There are\\n    three Elkinah's in the line of Heman. Fathers named sons after an admired\\n    brother or ancestor. Abraham's brother Nahor was named after their\\n    grandfather Nahor. Unger's Bible Dictionary lists 23 different Azariah's in\\n    the Old Testament.<a href=\\\"#_ftn1\\\" name=\\\"_ftnref1\\\" title=\\\"\\\">[1]</a>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Adding to the challenge of matching the right person with the right name,\\n    some people were known by two or even three different names and sometimes\\n    the spelling is rendered several different ways. (The same is true of place\\n    names which are commonly rendered by different spellings.) Sometimes it is\\n    impossible to tell if the same name found in different places is the same\\n    individual or a different individual. The careful student will keep all\\n    this in mind as he identifies the people in the OT, distinguishing between\\n    tentative and positive identifications.\\n</p>\\n<p class='verse'>\\n    <strong>Example 7 Details-The Daughters of Zelophehad.</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Then drew near the daughters of Zelophehad the son of Hepher, son of\\n    Gilead, son of Machir, son of Manasseh, from the clans of Manasseh the son\\n    of Joseph. Numbers 27:1 (cf. Numbers 26:28-33.)\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Zelophehad had five daughters but no sons. His daughters came to Moses\\n    asking for the inheritance of their father so that his name would continue\\n    in Israel. The LORD said that if a man had no sons, his daughters could\\n    preserve his name by receiving his portion of land. Their father belonged\\n    to the family of Hepher the son of Gilead, the son of Machir of the tribe\\n    of Manasseh. Their recorded line is\\n    Manasseh-Machir-Gilead-Hepher-Zelophehad-his five daughters-seven\\n    generations. This follows the pattern we have seen-tribe, Manasseh;\\n    clan-Machir; household-Gilead-the typical three level identification\\n    telling an Israelite who he was and with whom he belonged. An additional\\n    level is included in the daughters of Zelophehad, the family of Hepher.\\n    This event as we shall see set a precedent.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Now, what are the times involved? Manassah was born shortly before 1876 BC\\n    while the daughters brought their request to Moses just before his death at\\n    the end of the 40 years in the wilderness. Most likely they had a range of\\n    ages from 25 to 40 so they were born shortly after the Exodus. Thus the\\n    time span is approximately 430-years. At the rate of 25 years per\\n    generation their list should contain 17 names. It only contains 6. It skips\\n    about 11. We must conclude that the genealogy of these daughters follows\\n    the standard practice of naming tribe-clan-household and then skipping down\\n    to their father, adding only the family of Hepher and that up to 11\\n    generations are omitted.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>\\n        Examples 8 and 9 Overview-Sheerah and Joshua, I Chronicles 7:20-27.\\n    </strong>\\n    Interpreters are all over the map in their explanations of these verses due\\n    to duplication of names, the brevity of the list and the grammatical\\n    construction. We examine them because they reinforce principles previously\\n    pointed out regarding Hebrew genealogies-the naming of descendants after\\n    forefathers and the compactness of lists.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    There is yet another reason for including this passage: failure to do so\\n    allows it to be used to argue against our position. We do not claim to have\\n    the final answer, but the following interpretation makes far better sense\\n    than any other we have seen.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    First, we must suggest why the Sheerah and Joshua lists are found in\\n    Chronicles. Two reasons stand out: first, nine chapters record genealogical\\n    records that established Israel as a nation and second, to list the notable\\n    achievers in each tribe. Whereas half of the verses in the nine chapters\\n    are devoted to just two tribes, those of Judah and Levi, only ten verses\\n    (7:20-29) are devoted to the tribe of Ephraim, one of the smallest but most\\n    troublesome of all the tribes of Israel. So we have the famous and the\\n    infamous.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    While Ephraim would later divide the nation and later yet adopt idolatry\\n    wholesale, in the early days it had its proud moments. Sheerah, for\\n    instance, was a famous Ephraimite woman who lived after the conquest of\\n    Canaan when Israel was beginning to build a nation. She established\\n    significant Ephraimite settlements and is listed in vv20-24. Joshua is much\\n    better known. He succeeded Moses to command the victorious forces of Israel\\n    in subduing the Canaanites and is featured in vv 25-27.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Example 8 Details-Sheerah, I Chronicles 7:20-24. </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p class='verse'>\\n    <sup>20</sup>\\n    The sons of Ephraim: Shuthelah, and Bered his son, Tahath his son, Eleadah\\n    his son, Tahath his son, <sup>21</sup>Zabad his son, Shuthelah his son, and\\n    Ezer and Elead, whom the men of Gath who were born in the land killed,\\n    because they came down to raid their livestock. <sup>22</sup>And Ephraim\\ntheir father mourned many days, and his brothers came to comfort him.    <sup>23</sup>And Ephraim went in to his wife, and she conceived and bore a\\n    son. And he called his name Beriah, because disaster had befallen his\\n    house. <sup>24</sup>His daughter was Sheerah, who built both Lower and\\n    Upper Beth-horon, and Uzzen-sheerah. I Chron. 7:20-24.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Scripture frankly states that Sheerah's two brothers were killed stealing\\n    Philistine cattle. Israel lived in the hills; the Philistines lived on the\\n    coastal plain. The brothers, Ezer and Elead, showed stealth and initiative\\n    but they violated the territory of Gath, one of the five Philistine\\n    city-states adjacent to the Mediterranean Sea. This theft and their\\n    resulting deaths could only have happened after Israel had invaded Canaan\\n    and captured the land God had promised. Israel began the campaign for\\n    Canaan with the destruction of Jericho in 1406 BC. The campaign for the\\n    land took the next ten or twenty years.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    What confuses the reader is that Sheerah's father was named Ephraim after\\n    the founder of the tribe of Ephraim who lived 500 years before. This second\\n    Ephraim was crushed. He had great plans for the land he received in Canaan\\n    and his sons were obviously very motivated. Now his plans were shattered\\n    because he had lost them. Only a daughter remained. His brothers tried to\\n    comfort him but his mourning lasted many days. Maybe he was already an old\\n    man with little hope for having another son. Sometime later he saw\\n    possibilities in his daughter and made her his heir. Such an action had not\\n    been possible until the daughters of Zelophehad came to Moses just before\\n    his death about 1406 BC and God revealed that if a man had no sons, only\\n    daughters, he could designate a daughter as his heir. This act also\\n    requires that the brothers tried to steal the Philistine's cattle happened\\n    after Israel's settlement of Canaan.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The error of interpretation comes when commentators confuse Ephraim, the\\n    tribal chief who was Jacob's grandson, with a distant descendant by the\\n    same name who came along 500 years later but is essential to this story.\\n    They see a long list of names in verses twenty through twenty-seven which\\n    ends with Joshua and craft a story about how sons of Ephraim, the tribal\\n    chief, went up from Goshen to loot cattle at Gath early in the Egyptian\\n    sojourn and eventually Joshua ends this long list of descendants. They\\n    entirely overlook the fact that Scripture says the two brothers went down,\\n    not up to steal the cattle.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Instead they conclude that here is a complete list from the beginning of\\n    the Egyptian sojourn until the conquest of Canaan 500 years later-up to\\n    eighteen generations (depending on how they are counted). They conclude\\n    that Scripture does not abbreviate genealogies; families simply had\\n    traditions of marrying early or late and this accounts for the wide\\n    variation in the number of people in different lines. Their explanation\\n    overlooks the entire point of the list-that this second Ephraim's daughter\\n    pioneered two well-known settlements in Canaan after the Exodus and\\n    Israel's conquest of Canaan.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The standard interpretation is based on a poor understanding of these eight\\n    verses. Hebrew scholar C. F. Keil states that seeing but one Ephraim in the\\npassage makes it incomprehensible    <a href=\\\"#_ftn2\\\" name=\\\"_ftnref2\\\" title=\\\"\\\">[2]</a>. But even two lists, one\\n    ending with Sheerah and a second ending with Joshua, though abbreviated,\\n    offer far more names than just the two names between Levi and Aaron. These\\n    two lists provide two more arguments that the Levi-Aaron list is extremely\\n    condensed and at the same time are themselves examples of abbreviated\\n    genealogies.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The portion of Sheerah's line recorded here is: Ephraim-Shuthelah or\\n    Bered-Tahath-Eleadah-Tahath-Zabad-Shuthelah-Ephraim and his children-Ezer,\\n    Elead, Sheerah and Beriah (three brothers and a sister), nine generations.\\n    Where the text reads, \\\"Shuthelah and Bered his son,\\\" because it does not\\n    say \\\"Shuthelah his son, Bered his son,\\\" it is commonly understood that\\n    Shuthelah and Bered were brothers, so these two names represent one\\n    generation, not two. The text does not identify the brother through whom\\n    the line passed.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Most amazing of all, the list is not connected to the second Ephraim. You\\n    read correctly. The list concludes, \\\"Zabad his son, Shuthelah his son, and\\n    Ezer and Elead, whom the men of Gath&#8230;killed.\\\" The last name in this\\n    unbroken line is Shuthelah, the son of Zabad. Apparently the story of the\\n    brothers being killed while attempting to take Philistine cattle was well\\n    known, but the biographer did not have the remaining names in the list to\\n    link the second Shuthelah with the second Ephraim and his family. How many\\n    generations are missing? Our standard of 25 years per generation suggests\\n    eleven generations are omitted.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    If all the biographer knew was that this second Ephraim was a distant\\n    descendant of the tribal chief named Ephraim, why mention this list at all?\\n    It seems that it is introduced to help the reader place the deaths of the\\n    second Ephraim's sons in the time of the settlement of Canaan. The point is\\n    to get to his daughter who did the notable deed of building those famous\\n    Ephraimite settlements. She could only become the heiress if his only sons\\n    were dead and God was yet to give him another son.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    We suggest that with the death of her two brothers, her father mourned.\\n    Losing both sons was a great loss. Eventually he made his daughter his heir\\n    after the pattern of the daughters of Zelophehad. Sometime later God gave\\n    him another son of whom nothing more is said. But the daughter made a name\\n    for her father. She was a firebrand in the building of those two Ephraimite\\n    settlements and thus became a legend in the tribe of Ephraim.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    While an unknown number of generations are missing between Shuthelah #2 and\\n    the second Ephraim (we suggest eleven), the writer does give us seven\\n    generations between Ephraim and Sheerah, which is 3.5 times as many\\n    generations as the two between Levi and Aaron. This genealogy testifies to\\n    the Levi-Aaron line being extremely abbreviated, but illustrates another\\n    reason for abbreviating a line-the writer did not have the names that tied\\n    the second Shuthelah to the second Ephraim.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Example 9 Details-Joshua. </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p class='verse'>\\n    <sup>25</sup>\\n    Rephah was his son, Resheph his son [\\\"his son\\\" not found in the Hebrew],\\n    Telah his son, Tahan his son, <sup>26</sup>Ladan his son, Amminhud his son,\\n    Elishama his son, <sup>27</sup>Nun his son, Joshua his son. 1 Chronicles\\n    7:25-27.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Continuing to unravel the complex record of the tribe of Ephraim, \\\"Rephah\\n    was his son\\\" (verse 25) has no connection with verses 23-24 which talks\\n    about a man named Ephraim who lost two sons. Rather, it resumes listing\\n    further lines from those first introduced in verse twenty. It lists many\\n    generations and concludes with Joshua who lived in the generation of the\\n    man who lost his sons. Thus, \\\"Rephah was his son\\\" is not a continuation of\\n    verse twenty-four but is starting over from verse twenty.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Verse 25 reads, \\\"Rephah was his son, Resheph his son\\\" in the English text.\\n    \\\"His son\\\" is missing after \\\"Resheph,\\\" in the Hebrew text. C. F. Keil notes\\nthat such a construction usually indicates the two were brothers.    <a href=\\\"#_ftn3\\\" name=\\\"_ftnref3\\\" title=\\\"\\\">[3]</a> The Hebrews frequently\\n    named children with pleasant rhyming sounds. \\\"Rephah\\\" and \\\"Resheph\\\" answer\\n    to that practice which further strengthens the idea that they were\\n    brothers. The historian is starting over with a new line from Ephraim in\\n    verse 20 to show Joshua's lineage. Neither Rephah or Resheph are listed in\\n    Numbers 26 as clans of Ephraim; but, in this list is Tahan and a Tahan is\\n    listed in Numbers 26 as the head of an Ephramite clan. Therefore, the\\n    second Tahan is most likely named after his clan's founder and identifies\\n    Joshua's clan. This list then is as follows: Joseph-Ephraim-Tahan-either\\n    Rephah or Resheph-Telah-Tahan-Ladan-Ammihud-Elishma-Nun-Joshua, eleven\\n    generations in all.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Let us compare the generations in Joshua's line to those in Aaron's line.\\n    Levi is about seven years older than his brother Joseph. Levi began the\\n    Aaron line while Joseph-Ephraim began the Joshua line. Aaron was 83 at the\\n    time of the Exodus while Joshua was about 40; so, Joshua's father, Nun,\\n    would be about Aaron's age. Only two names come between Levi and Aaron\\n    while eight names come between Joseph and Nun. Each name represents a new\\n    generation. By this measure 3/4ths of the names are omitted between Levi\\n    and Aaron.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Now an estimate of missing generations in Joshua's line can be made.\\n    Ephraim was born about 1878 BC while Joshua was born about 1470 BC or 408\\n    years later. At the rate of 25 years per generation, Joshua was born about\\n    16 generations after Joseph. Since only eight generations are named, eight\\n    are omitted.\\n</p>\\n<h4 id='working-wth-hebrew-names'>\\n    Working with Hebrew Names\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\n    The Hebrews often named sons after famous forefathers or beloved relatives.\\n    In Sheerah's list are three such examples: a first and second Ephraim, a\\n    first and second Shuthelah and a first and second Tahath. Joshua's list\\n    does not list his clan, but down a ways is the name \\\"Tahan.\\\" In Numbers\\n    \\\"Tahan\\\" is the name of a clan of Ephraim. We suggest that the nation was\\n    well aware that Joshua belonged to the clan of Tahan so the historian did\\n    not think it necessary to include it. Further down in Joshua's list someone\\n    named a son after the famous clan leader, providing another example of\\n    naming sons after famous forefathers.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Concerning the integrity of Joshua's list, while Scripture does not tell\\n    his clan, it repeatedly identifies him as the son of Nun. We also know\\n    beyond doubt that at the time of the Exodus the chief of Joshua's tribe,\\n    the tribe of Ephraim, was Elishama and five times in the book of Numbers he\\n    is said to be the son of Ammihud. The only time these two sets of names\\n    (Nun-Joshua and Amminhud-Elishama) come together is in the passage before\\n    us, thus adding further certainty to the names in Joshua's line.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Example 10 Details-Caleb. </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p class='verse'>\\n    <sup>6</sup>\\n    Then the people of Judah came to Joshua at Gilgal. And Caleb the son of\\n    Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him, \\\"You know what the LORD said to Moses\\n    the man of God in Kadesh-barnea concerning you and me. <sup>7</sup>I was\\n    forty years old [Joshua was 39] when Moses the servant of the LORD sent me\\n    from Kadesh-barnea to spy out the land&#8230; <sup>9</sup>And Moses swore\\n    on that day, saying, 'Surely the land on which your foot has trodden shall\\n    be an inheritance for you and your children forever, because you have\\n    wholly followed the LORD my God.'\\\" <sup>13</sup>Then Joshua blessed him,\\nand he gave Hebron to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for an inheritance.    <sup>14</sup>Therefore Hebron became the inheritance of Caleb the son of\\n    Jephunneh the Kenizzite to this day, because he wholly followed the LORD,\\n    the God of Israel. Joshua 14:6-7, 9, 13-14.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    After God gave Israel the Law at Mount Sinai, Israel moved to the edge of\\n    the Promised Land where Moses sent twelve men to spy out Canaan.

Ten said the land flowed with\\n    milk and honey; but, it was occupied by giants. In comparison, the Hebrews\\n    seemed like grasshoppers. They concluded, \\\"We are not able to go up against\\n    the people, for they are stronger than we are\\\" (Numbers 13:31). Two,\\n    disagreed saying, \\\"Let us go up at once and occupy it, for we are well able\\n    to overcome it\\\" (Numbers 13:30).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The congregation raised a loud cry and wept that night, saying \\\"Would that\\n    we had died in the land of Egypt...Why is the LORD bringing us into this\\n    land, to fall by the sword?...Would it not be better for us to go back to\\n    Egypt...Let us choose a leader and go back to Egypt\\\" (Numbers 14:1-4). The\\n    two spies with the favorable report, Joshua representing the tribe of\\n    Ephraim and Caleb representing the tribe of Judah, said, \\\"If the LORD\\n    delights in us, he will bring us into this land and give it to us...only do\\n    not rebel against the LORD and do not fear the people of the land, for they\\n    are bread for us...their protection is removed from them, and the LORD is\\n    with us, do not fear them\\\" (Numbers 14:8-9).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    With that the congregation prepared to stone Moses, Aaron, Joshua and\\n    Caleb. Then the glory of the LORD appeared at the tent of meeting, saying,\\n</p>\\n<p class='verse'>\\n    How long will this people despise me? And how long will they not believe in\\n    me, in spite of all the signs that I have done among them? <sup>12</sup>I\\n    will strike them with the pestilence and disinherit them, and I will make\\n    of you a nation greater and mightier than they. Numbers 14:11-12.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    In the face of impending doom Moses pleaded with God, arguing that \\\"If you\\n    kill this people as one man, then the nations who have heard your fame will\\n    say, <sup>16</sup>'It is because the LORD was not able to bring this people\\n    into the land that he swore to give to them, that he has killed them in the\\n    wilderness'\\\" (Numbers 14:15-16). Moses prevailed. God relented on\\n    destroying the nation but pronounced judgment: none of the men who saw the\\n    signs in Egypt would see the Promised Land, except for the faithful spies.\\n    The congregation would spend one year in the wilderness for each day the\\n    spies saw the goodness of the Promised Land. Then God sent a plague that\\n    took the lives of the ten unbelieving spies.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    We have examined the genealogy of Joshua, the spy who represented the tribe\\n    of Ephraim. Now we tackle the genealogy of the spy who represented the\\n    tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh. But alas, Caleb's genealogy is\\n    nowhere to be found! He was so famous in his day that apparently no one\\n    needed his genealogy. So, in a way, we can't really speak of it being\\n    abbreviated. Yet, we can partially piece it together. The pieces in\\n    themselves are fascinating when it comes to unscrambling Hebrew\\n    genealogies.\\n</p>\\n<h4>\\n    Name Duplication Confuses Generational Considerations\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\n    To begin with, there is confusion over the repetition of names. Two famous\\n    Calebs appear in Israel's early history. The first was a grandson of Perez;\\n    the second is our Caleb, the faith-filled spy, who lived 400 years later\\n    and descended from the first Caleb.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    At this point we must recall the importance of Perez. Perez represented the\\n    powerful impact of the tribe of Judah on Israel's history. Perez is made\\n    famous by his son Hezron who fathered Jerahmeel, Ram and Caleb. Their lines\\n    are the subject of I Chronicles 2. The chapter lists 23 generations of\\n    Hezron's firstborn Jerahmeel (Table 5. 1). It gives the genealogy of Ram\\n    his second son all the way down to David. Other lists continue that line to\\n    Christ. Of particular interest to us is Hezron's third son Caleb (also\\n    called Chelubai).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Again, Perez was born about the time God directed Jacob to relocate in\\n    (1876 BC). Hezron would have been born about 25 years later and Caleb, as\\n    Hezron's third son, would have been born about 30 years after his father's\\n    birth. The key that seems to unlock the door to there being two Calebs is\\n    the concluding statement in the extensive genealogical information about\\n    the first Caleb in 1 Chronicles 2. Verse 49 says, \\\"And the daughter of\\n    Caleb was Achsah.\\\"\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Achsah is a name given to just one person in the Old Testament and her\\n    story is most unusual. The second Caleb was 85 when Canaan was conquered\\n    and Joshua was parceling it out to the tribes. This Caleb was promised\\n    Hebron because he followed the Lord fully. Now he was requesting his\\n    inheritance and Joshua granted his request. Caleb drove out the giants in\\n    one area of Hebron, but those in nearby Debir were too strong for him. He\\n    promised his daughter's hand in marriage to the warrior that conquered\\n    Debir. His cousin Othneil was successful and received Achsah.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    When 1 Chronicles 2:49 says \\\"the daughter of Caleb [Caleb #1] was Achsah,\\\"\\n    it is using the word \\\"daughter\\\" in the broad sense of a distant\\n    granddaughter. Since she was in the first Caleb's line, her immediate\\n    father, the second Caleb, would obviously also be in this line. The second\\n    Caleb was named after his famous ancestor, the first Caleb. So his line\\n    begins: Judah-Perez-Hezron-Caleb and ends with Jephunneh-Caleb-Achsah. Thus\\n    we have seven names in a period that encompasses about 20 generations.\\n    Perez was a part of Judah's second family, born after Judah's three sons\\n    had grown up and two had married. We must count these as two successive\\n    generations, not one. Now we have identified eight generations in the line\\n    of Caleb the spy.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Numbers 32:12 and Joshua 14:6 speak of \\\"Caleb the son of Jephunneh the\\n    Kenizzite.\\\" The Kenazzites were an extended family in the tribe of Judah.\\n    \\\"Son of Kenaz\\\" means a descendant of the father of this household, not\\n    particularly an immediate son. All of this suggests a number of additional\\n    generations, anywhere from one to six or even more. Now we are up to nine\\n    to fourteen generations in the family of Caleb of the tribe of Judah.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    But we are not done. This first Caleb had a son named Mareshah who named a\\n    son Hebron (I Chronicles 2:42). The town of Hebron was extremely important\\n    in Jewish history, being Abraham's home after he and Lot separated. It\\n    remains to this day the site where he, Isaac, Jacob and their wives were\\n    buried. There Abraham enjoyed great favor with God. Apparently Mareshah\\n    told the story of Abraham's years at Hebron so many times that he ended up\\n    naming a son after that place of great blessing.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    This line of Judah retold the story again and again. When the spy\\n    assignments were given out, Caleb who was raised on those stories,\\n    requested the assignment of spying out Hebron. After he gave the good\\n    report the LORD promised that his inheritance would be everywhere he walked\\n    in the Hebron area. When Joshua divided up the land he upheld God's promise\\n    by assigning Hebron to Caleb. If our conjecture is correct, we can add the\\n    names of Mareshah and Hebron to his line: 1-Judah; 2-Judah's first family;\\n    3-Perez, part of Judah's second family; 4-Hezron; 5-the first Caleb;\\n    6-Mareshah; 7-Hebron plus Kenaz and five to nine generations surrounding\\n    him and finally, Jephunneh-Caleb-Achsah, a minimum of eleven generations\\n    and up to twenty generations.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    This list shows us how to take Aaron's list. Between Levi and Aaron are\\n    just two names, Kohath and Amram. Here, between Judah, who was born one\\n    year after Levi, and Caleb's father, who was the same age as Aaron, are\\n    seven known generations and an undetermined number of generations before\\n    and after Kenaz. If we assume just five generations are unnamed, we have\\n    twelve versus the two in Aaron's line. Aaron's line seems to be condensed\\n    by at least 5/6<sup>ths</sup> when compared to Caleb's line.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Imagine the strain in viewing but one Caleb to uphold a 215-year Egyptian\\n    sojourn. Somehow the first Caleb is the only Caleb. He is both the son of\\n    Hezron and the son of Jephunneh. He lived early in the Egyptian sojourn and\\n    he lived after the Exodus, the 40 years in the desert and the conquest of\\n    Canaan. What a difficult position! But a 430-year Egyptian sojourn fully\\n    accommodates the spy's line.\\n</p>\\n<h3 id='david-and-remaining-examples'>\\n    David, the Bridge (1876-1000 BC), and <br/>\\n    Remaining Examples (1446-1000 BC)\\n</h3>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Example 11 Details-David. </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p class='verse'>\\n    <sup>18</sup>\\nNow these are the generations of Perez: Perez fathered Hezron,<sup>19</sup>Hezron fathered <u>Ram</u>, Ram fathered <u>Amminadab</u>,<sup>20</sup>Amminadab fathered <u>Nahshon</u>, Nahshon fathered<u>Salmon</u>, <sup>21</sup>Salmon fathered <u>Boaz</u>, Boaz fathered<u>Obed</u>, <sup>22</sup>Obed fathered <u>Jesse</u>, and Jesse fathered    <u>David</u>.

Our\\n    final four examples following David focus on the line of Aaron and\\n    Levitical service in the tabernacle that covered the period of the Judges.\\n    Because of the familiarity of certain names in David's ancestry, Hebrew\\n    practice could reduce it to just a handful. Of all the names in this list,\\n    the most familiar was that of David himself, Israel's most famous and\\n    beloved king, born about 1040 BC. Another was Nahshon, Prince of Judah, at\\n    the time of the Exodus. Yet another was Boaz, the kinsman-redeemer, who\\n    brought the Moabitess Ruth into the line of Christ, a story celebrated in\\n    the book bearing her name. Perez, the first in David's list, was founder of\\n    the most illustrious clan of Judah. He was born about the time Israel moved\\n    to Egypt-1876 BC.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    These are four of the ten names in David's line. The ten span an astounding\\n    836 years. At the rate of four generations per century a complete list\\n    might contain as many as 33 names! Due to adjustments for known\\n    circumstances, we reduce this number to 30 names in all, of which 20 are\\n    omitted. This list of exactly ten names is found in Ruth chapter four. It\\n    can be followed within the longer list of I Chronicles two. The names in\\n    these two lists leading to David are identical and in the same order,\\n    starting with Perez and concluding with David. They are repeated without\\n    change in the lists of Matthew and Luke. This highly abbreviated list was\\n    efficient. It produced a pleasing effect and it made the story flow. It was\\n    characteristically Hebrew.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Before looking at the details, a word about the rest of this chapter: still\\n    to come are four more examples of abbreviated genealogies- the priesthood,\\n    Ezra and the temple singers-15 examples in all. To further develop the\\n    subject, three additional lines and five side-by-side tables are\\n    introduced. To avoid confusion, the same numbers assigned in the Appendix\\n    are used here. So, 15 of the 22 tables are separate examples of condensed\\n    genealogies. The first side-by-side table contains the lists of David and\\n    Jerahmeel. Starting with Perez David's list has six names while Jerahmeel\\n    has 23 for the same time frame. The side-by-side tables both visualize\\n    omitted generations and provide double checking.\\n</p>\\n<h4 id='three-groups-separated-by-hundreds-of-years'>\\n    Three Groups Separated by Hundreds of Years\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\n    Upon examining David's list more carefully it is grouped around three\\n    periods of Hebrew history-three names at the beginning of the Egyptian\\n    sojourn, three names at the time of the Exodus 430-years later, and four\\n    names concluding with David's day 400 years after that. Those three groups\\n    of names were commonly known to be in a single line of descent, so there\\n    was no need to include all the omitted names since the purpose of Hebrew\\n    genealogies was identifying ancestry, not proving it.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The first group should have started with Judah, and the longer lists do\\n    include him. But in Ruth the list starts with Perez. The name \\\"Perez\\\",\\n    Judah's fourth son, was almost synonymous with the name \\\"Judah.\\\" From Perez\\n    came not only the bulk of the tribe's population but its kings, Bezelel the\\n    chief Temple artist, Caleb the spy and, most importantly, the promised\\n    Messiah. By beginning with Perez, the list in Ruth presents exactly ten\\n    names, a deliberate design which further indicates that it was abbreviated.\\n    From Perez the line of David went through his son Hezron and Hezron's\\n    second son Ram. Hezron was Perez's oldest son, so if typical he would have\\n    been born 25 years after his father. Thus, Hezron's second son, Ram would\\n    have been born about 29 years after his father (boy, girl, boy, girl;\\n    spaced two years apart). This places the births of Hezron and Ram at about\\n    1851 BC and 1822 BC.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The second group (Amminadab-Nahshon-Salmon) centers around Nahshon, the\\n    famous Prince of Judah who supervised the census for his tribe at the time\\n    of the Exodus (Numbers 1). Aaron married a sister of Nahshon. The father of\\n    these important people, Amminadab, was a household name in Israel. Aaron\\n    was 84 at the time of the census so his wife was possibly 10-15 years\\n    younger or 67-74. Most likely she was an older sister of Nahshon. This\\n    would make Amminadab 95-100 years at the time of the census, placing his\\n    birth somewhere around 1540 BC. Since about 280 years passed between the\\n    birth of Ram, the last person in the first group, and the birth of\\n    Amminadab, the first person in the second group (1822-1540=282), Ram is the\\n    only person available to span these nearly three centuries. On the basis of\\n    four generations per century, eleven generations are missing between Ram\\n    and Amminadab.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    This second set of three names concludes with Salmon. Matthew identifies\\n    Salmon as a member of this group when he states \\\"Salmon the father of Boaz\\n    by Rahab...\\\" (Matthew 1:5). Scriptures covering that period do not speak of\\n    Salmon's marriage or even Salmon, so apart from Matthew his place in the\\n    time frame between Nahshon and Boaz would be unknown. But the clue is found\\n    in Matthew's reference to Rahab, the famous resident of Jericho at the time\\n    of the Hebrew invasion in 1406 BC who hid the two spies. As a reward they\\n    promised that her family would be spared in the coming Hebrew conquest. A\\n    son of Nahshon by the name of Salmon married her, continuing the line of\\n    Perez to David. Many commentators conclude Salmon was one of the two\\n    unnamed spies.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    How do the numbers work out? Salmon would have been under military age at\\n    the time when the ten spies brought back the bad report and God sentenced\\n    Israel to a year in the wilderness for every day the spies searched Canaan.\\n    With Amminadab at an estimated 95 and Nahshon at 65 this would place Salmon\\n    at the age of 40 when Israel captured and destroyed Jericho. That military\\n    victory was in 1406 BC, 40 years after the Exodus. The events somewhat\\n    dictate the ages of those three men.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The 1446 BC Exodus date affords an ideal point to estimate the ages of the\\n    principals in this second group. Ten of the 12 spies shortly after the\\n    Exodus returned a bad report. They were around the age of 40. Apparently\\n    Joshua decided to send more mature spies in 1406 BC-those around 50 or 55.\\n    This would place Salmon's birth about 1456-1461 BC, ten or fifteen years\\n    before the Exodus. As stated above Amminadab was about 90 then. Aaron was\\n    83 (Exodus 7:7). His wife (Nahshon's older sister-Elisheba) would have been\\n    around 65. This would make Nahshon about 60 and further confirm Salmon's\\n    age at about 10 or 15.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    As to Rahab's age when she hid the spies, she had a considerable reputation\\n    and an extensive family as well; so she also must have been older, possibly\\n    even in her forties, about ten years younger than Salmon. Since Boaz lived\\n    hundreds of years later, when Scripture says Salmon fathered Boaz, it is\\n    using the term \\\"fathered\\\" in the broad sense of being the forefather of\\n    Boaz. Two hundred eighty-two years passed between the birth of the last\\n    father in the first group and the first father in the second group. Now we\\n    find a second large gap between the second and third group of fathers. Next\\n    we will determine how many years elapsed between Salmon who was born about\\n    1456 BC and Boaz who lived near the time of David.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The final group in this list contains four generations\\n    (Boaz-Obed-Jesse-David). These are immediate father-son relationships.\\n</p>\\n<p class='verse'>\\n    The women of the neighborhood gave him [the child of Boaz and Ruth] a name,\\n    saying, 'A son has been born to Naomi.' They named him Obed. He was the\\n    father of Jesse, the father of David. Ruth 4:17.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    David was born about 1040 BC. Since he was the youngest of eight sons, his\\n    father would have been born about 1080 BC. The birth of Obed would have\\n    been c. 25 years earlier, about 1105 BC. Boaz was older when he married\\n    Ruth, possibly 60, so c. 1165 B.C. would mark his birth. Salmon, the last\\n    father in the previous group, was born about 1461-1456 BC; so, 300 years\\n    passed between the births of Salmon and Boaz. Our standard rate for new\\n    generations suggests twelve generations should have occurred during this\\n    period. Adjusting for the late start of families can account for several of\\n    these generations, but at least nine are omitted. Added to the eleven\\n    generations omitted between the first and second group, about 20\\n    generations are omitted in this list from Perez to David. Each of the ten\\n    names in the list had an important place in Hebrew history. Most likely the\\n    other 20 were relatively unknown. This is classic Hebrew genealogy. It\\n    appears without alteration in Matthew and Luke.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Since some may suggest that Scripture gives many examples of starting\\n    generations late, we would be the first to acknowledge such examples.\\n    However, they are exceptions, not the rule. As soon as the difficulty was\\n    removed, the normal pattern took over. Jacob delayed taking a wife when he\\n    saw the distress of his parents over Esau's two Canaanite wives. He was 81\\n    when God gave him a wife, and in the next ten years he had twelve children\\n    (by four wives). On the other hand Arphachshad, the first named person\\n    after the Flood, and the next six generations each started having sons\\n    between the ages of twenty-nine and thirty-five. That was normal then.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Abraham's father began his family at the age of 70, but we know the\\n    reason-infertility. Infertility was an intermittent problem in Terah's\\n    line. His daughter, Sarah, was infertile, having a child by the direct\\n    intervention of God at the age of ninety. Rebekah, granddaughter of Terah,\\n    was infertile and had twins by the direct intervention of God when Isaac\\n    was sixty. All of this was abnormal. When Jacob moved his family to Egypt,\\n    his twelve sons were between the ages of 48 and 24. All of them had sons.\\n    Some even appear to have had grandsons. Joseph, who died at the age of 110,\\n    saw his descendants to the fourth generation (Genesis 50:23). Starting\\n    families between the ages of 18 and early thirties was typical of Hebrew\\n    culture after Jacob.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Example 12 Details-The Priesthood of Israel. </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Because every generation of God's chosen people was dependent upon the\\n    priesthood, it is unlikely that its genealogical list would be considerably\\n    condensed.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Of all the genealogies in Israel, the Priesthood upheld the heart of the\\n    nation - its relationship with the God of the universe who called it to a\\n    unique and formidable mission. The priesthood was unique in its structure,\\n    because it taught the nation God's holiness, the essence and acts of sin\\n    and sin's necessary absolution through sacrifice. It was formidable, in\\n    that relationship to God depended upon adherence to His laws. However,\\n    built into that relationship were important promises within a covenant\\n    which were repeated and enhanced, some unconditional because they depended\\n    upon God's love and grace alone.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    God chose this special line when the Hebrews numbered several million and\\n    the adult males among them numbered seven or eight hundred thousand. From\\n    them God chose just one man, Aaron, and his four sons to become the\\n    officials to keep the nation true to God. His two oldest sons taught, by\\n    bad example, that to violate God's instructions for worship could be lethal\\n    when they offered strange fire and God slew them. The two remaining sons,\\n    Eleazar and Ithamar and their descendants alone would be the nation's\\n    priests.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Numbers 18:7 cites the divine authorization for this hereditary priesthood.\\n    To Aaron God said: \\\"You and your sons with you shall guard your priesthood\\n    for all that concerns the altar and that is within the veil; and you shall\\n    serve. I give your priesthood as a gift, and any outsider who comes near\\n    shall be put to death.\\\" The priesthood particularly involved \\\"the altar and\\n    what was within the veil.\\\" To assist Aaron in all the work associated with\\n    the exacting demands of the Tabernacle operations, all the rest of the\\n    tribe of Levi, some 22,000 males, was a gift to him \\\"to do the service of\\n    the tent of meeting\\\" (Numbers 18:6). In the beginning the priesthood of\\n    Israel was indeed selective.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Levi's three sons-Gershon, Kohath and Merari-gave the tribe its three\\n    clans. They camped on three sides of the Tabernacle while Moses and Aaron\\n    tented on the entrance side which faced east. Levites of retirement age\\n    were to guard the Tabernacle, forbidding unauthorized access and putting to\\n    death any who violated its sacredness. (Whether they ever executed anyone\\n    or not, their very presence assured a proper respect for the Tabernacle.)\\n    This institution (priest, Tabernacle, sacrifice and Ark) represented God in\\n    the midst of Israel. He was the very reason for Israel's existence. To\\n    weaken this institution was like making war with God who uniquely\\n    established the nation. Therefore, trifling with the Tabernacle would be a\\n    most capital offense.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Numbers 3:4 relates that \\\"Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests in the\\n    lifetime of Aaron their father.\\\" At the time of Aaron's death God told\\n    Moses, <sup>25</sup>\\\"Take Aaron and Eleazar his son and bring them up to\\n    Mount Hor. <sup>26</sup>And strip Aaron of his garments and put them on\\n    Eleazar his son. <sup>27</sup>And Aaron shall be gathered to his people and\\n    shall die there\\\" (Numbers 20:25-27). All the descendants of Aaron who met\\n    the qualifications could serve as priests but only one would wear the\\n    special garment of high priest.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    A short time later Israel began whoring with the daughters of Moab (Numbers\\n    25:1). God said to hang the chiefs of the people to stop the plague He had\\n    sent. Moses ordered the judges to slay the guilty under them. Phinehas,\\n    grandson of Aaron and son of Eleazar, took a spear and plunged it through a\\n    prominent Israelite man and noted Moabite woman in the man's bedchamber.\\n    God said the zeal of Phinehas had turned back His anger from consuming the\\n    nation even though the plague took 24,000. As a reward God said:\\n</p>\\n<p class='verse'>\\n    <sup>12</sup>\\n    Behold, I give to him [Phinehas] my covenant of peace, <sup>13</sup>and it\\n    shall be to him and to his descendants after him the covenant of a\\n    perpetual priesthood, because he was jealous for his God and made atonement\\n    for the people of Israel. Numbers 25:12-13.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    This event apparently established the official line of high priests in\\n    Israel. While all of Aaron's descendants qualified genealogically as\\n    priests, God appointed Aaron's older surviving son Eleazar to be Aaron's\\n    successor; and, this verse arranged that the position of chief priest would\\n    be given to Eleazar's son Phinehas and his line. The next half dozen chief\\n    priests were all direct descendants of Phinehas.\\n</p>\\n<h4 id='switching-from-the-line-of-eleazar'>\\n    Switching from the Line of Eleazar to the Line of Ithamar: Meet the High\\n    Priest Eli\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\n    Then for some unexplained reason the work of high priest switched from a\\n    descendant of Aaron's older son Eleazar to a descendant of his younger son\\n    Ithamar. How strange, in view of this covenant given to Phinehas. Since\\n    service at the Tabernacle was essential for the accomplishment of God's\\n    purpose with Israel, commentators have surmised that some unusual\\n    circumstance led to the necessity of calling on Ithamar's line, such as the\\n    existing chief priest becoming incapacitated, or the next in line being\\n    just an infant, or the demands of being both a chief priest and judge being\\n    too great for the next priest in line at that time.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Whatever circumstance led to calling on the line of Ithamar, the elders of\\n    Israel must have sought the LORD, and He designated Eli. Almost unanimously\\n    commentators agree that Eli was the legitimate acting chief priest.\\n    However, the official record of I Chronicles six does not mention him. As\\n    far as can be determined it only lists direct descendants of Eleazar\\n    through Phinehas. The equivalent of five generations from the line of Eli\\n    served as high priests for well over a century. After that the position\\n    reverted to the descendants of Aaron's older son Eleazar. While this switch\\n    was strange, the overriding principle was that God needed faithful priests.\\n    In His sovereign choice, He raised up the line of Eli who filled that need\\n    for a time. Although his two sons were worthless men, without question,\\n    Eli, his grandson Ahitub, then Abimelech and finally Abiathar were godly\\n    men and faithful priests.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Saul wiped out 84 priests of Eli's descendants wearing the ephod at Nob (I\\n    Samuel 22:6-23). One alone, Abiathar, escaped to David and served under him\\n    as David continued to elude Saul. Abiathar came with an ephod (I Samuel\\n    23:6) which allowed David to inquire of the LORD. Through Abiathar and his\\n    ephod the LORD gave specific instructions concerning David's efforts to\\n    avoid being killed by Saul (I Samuel 23:2, 4, 9-12). With all but one of\\n    the priests who descended from Eli dead and that sole surviving priest\\n    being with the fugitive David, Israel had no functioning priesthood.\\n    Scripture does not tell how, but descendants of Eleazar again began serving\\n    as priests for the rest of the nation. So, for a period, two high priests\\n    served, one with David from the family of Ithamar and one with the nation\\n    at Gibeon from the family of Eleazar.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Near the end of David's life, the priest with David (Abiathar of the\\n    Ithamar line) supported Adonijah, David's son who was born next after\\n    Absalom and unwisely declared himself as David's successor when David was\\n    bedridden. By that time Zadok of the line of Eleazar was backing David.\\n    After David made Solomon king, Solomon retired Abiathar; but his son\\n    Jonathan, and later grandson Ahimelech served as head of the eight courses\\n    of priests made up from the Ithamar line.\\n</p>\\n<h4 id='why-didnt-samuel-succeed-eli-as-high-priest'>\\n    Why Didn't Samuel Succeed Eli as High Priest?\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\n    If the case of Eli was unusual, the case of Samuel was doubly so. Most\\n    Bible students know that Eli's sons were wicked, even fornicating with\\n    female servants at the Tabernacle. Scripture calls them worthless and said\\n    they blasphemed the sacrifices of the LORD. Their debauchery was a national\\n    scandal. Samuel's mother, who was barren, saw the need for a faithful\\n    priest at Shiloh and vowed that if the LORD gave her a son, she would\\n    dedicate him to serve God all his life. Hannah and her husband Elkanah were\\n    descendants of Levi, serving the tribe of Ephraim and thus called\\n    \\\"Ephrathites\\\" (I Samuel 1:1). As Levites they were very concerned for the\\n    spiritual welfare of Israel. But Elkanah was not a descendant of Aaron so\\n    he was not a priest. God gave Hannah the son she prayed for; and, once he\\n    was weaned she left him with Eli. Her prayer of praise in I Samuel 2\\n    contains images of her expectations that God would triumph over evil\\n    through righteous servants.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Through the years Eli found Samuel to be all that his sons were not and\\n    trained Samuel to perform the duties of a priest. Meanwhile God began to\\n    give visions to Samuel so that in time all Israel knew that God spoke\\n    through him. Then came the day when Eli's sons carried the ark into battle\\n    against the Philistines who defeated the Israelites, captured the ark and\\n    killed Eli's two sons. When the news reached Eli he fell over backwards and\\n    died of a broken neck. He was 98 years old. His two wicked sons were most\\n    likely in their sixties and his oldest grandchildren could have been over\\n    30. One was actually born that day.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    We might expect Samuel, who by this time was about 30, to step into the\\n    role of chief priest but he did not. In fact, he did not call himself a\\n    priest and Scripture never calls him a priest. This is amazing since he\\n    wore the ephod, the priests' garment, and Scripture says repeatedly that he\\n    \\\"ministered unto the LORD under Eli.\\\" How can this be explained? The answer\\n    is twofold-first his genealogy but second God's purposes. Samuel was not a\\n    descendant of Aaron. While he was a Levite, he could never be the high\\n    priest or even hold the office of priest because he was not a son of Aaron.\\n    As a Levite he could assist Eli in any way Eli asked, but on his own\\n    authority, he could not offer sacrifice at the Tabernacle. He knew his\\n    genealogy and honored God by somehow avoiding the designation of priest. In\\n    fact he must have made this clear to his contemporaries because the title\\n    \\\"priest\\\" is never given to him in Scripture. This remarkable dedication in\\n    itself is an evidence of the inerrancy of Scripture.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    But secondly, a man of God came to Eli even before Samuel's call when he\\n    was still very young. After rehearsing the wickedness of Eli's sons, he\\n    said, <sup>30</sup>\\\"The God of Israel declares 'I promised that your house\\n    and the house of your father should go in and out before me forever,' but\\n    now the LORD declares: 'Far be it from me, for those who honor me I will\\n    honor, and those who despise me shall be lightly esteemed. <sup>31</sup>\\n    Behold, the days are coming when I will cut off your strength and the\\n    strength of your father's house, so that there will not be an old man in\\n    your house\\\" (I Samuel 2:31-32). Then comes the principle basic to any\\n    blessing from God: \\\"I will raise up for myself a faithful priest, who shall\\n    do according to what is in my heart and in my mind\\\" (I Samuel 2:35).\\n    Implicit in enjoying any promised blessing of God is a heart submitted to\\n    His will.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    This explains how Samuel could \\\"minister unto the LORD\\\" yet not officially\\n    be a priest. Above all, God honors and receives the service of faithful\\n    servants. But the story is not done. I Chronicles 9:22 gives Samuel credit\\n    along with David for organizing activities at the Tabernacle. Apparently\\n    when Eli and his sons died on the same day, the fear of the LORD gripped\\n    Eli's remaining descendants and, if not before, they became very humble and\\n    teachable. Samuel began a training program for Eli's grandsons and over the\\n    years both organized and standardized the priestly services at the\\n    Tabernacle so that Eli's next three generations all served faithfully as\\n    priests. Possibly Samuel did this through his office as the last judge of\\n    Israel. Regardless, the intent of his mother's prayer, that righteousness\\n    would prevail, was answered.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    We know Samuel's genealogy because David appointed his grandson, Heman, to\\n    be the chief choirmaster at the Tabernacle. His apparently complete\\n    genealogy beginning with Korah (Table 5.2) is given in the Chronicles\\n    chapter (I Chronicles 6) devoted to Levi's descendants. Genealogies were an\\n    essential feature to the success of Israel in accomplishing God's purposes\\n    with the nation. Godly Israelites such as Samuel held the genealogies as\\n    the very word and will of God.\\n</p>\\n<h4 id='other-characteristics-of-israels-high-priests'>\\n    Other Characteristics of Israel's High Priests\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\n    The succession of high priests is not a reliable way to measure the passing\\n    of time. Whereas generations were measured from the birth of the father to\\n    the birth of his first son, the office of high priest was just the\\n    opposite. When the high priest died or became extremely disabled, his son\\n    assumed the office. (The same was true for Israel's kings.) So in the case\\n    of the chief priest, time would be measured from the death of one to the\\n    death of the next.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    While on first glance this seams reliable; in fact, it is not. In the case\\n    of Eli, when he died at the age of 98 he was blind (I Samuel 4:15). His\\n    sons (and Samuel) had been doing the work of the high priest but neither of\\n    them held the office. Eli's sons actually died before their father died and\\n    Eli's grandson succeeded Eli as the next chief priest. In the case of\\n    Israel's first high priest, Aaron, it seems that his sons, Eleazar and\\n    Ithamar, were doing most of the work in Aaron's later years. In the next\\n    generation Phinehas was very active while his father Eleazar was still\\n    alive and held the office.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The practice of calling their sons by famous names was commonly practiced\\n    by Israel's later high priests. In the list of 23 names of I Chronicles 6,\\n    there are three duplicates (Amariah, Ahitub and Zadak) and one triplicate\\n    (Azariah). Eli also followed this practice by naming his second son after\\n    Aaron's famous grandson Phinehas. His line also first used the name Ahitub\\n    which the official line would later use twice. The Chronicles list also\\n    begins with Jacob, Levi, Kohath and Amram before naming Aaron, Israel's\\n    first high priest. That mentioning is an example of condensing because\\n    there are up to twelve unnamed generations between Amram and Aaron.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    As to the completeness of the Chronicles list, Dr. Keil writes: \\\"We find\\n    too few names for the time from the death of Aaron to the death of Uzzi\\n    (Ozi), when Eli became high priest-a period of 299 years [by the\\n    Keil/Delitzsche chronology]&#8230;. Five high priests-Eleazar, Phinehas,\\n    Abishua, Bukki and Uzzi-are too few; for in that case each one of them must\\n    have discharged the office for 60 years, and have begotten the son who\\n    succeeded him in the office only in his 60<sup>th</sup> year, or the\\n    grandson must have regularly succeeded the grandfather in the office-all of\\n    which suppositions appear somewhat incredible. Clearly, therefore,\\n    intermediate names must have been omitted in our register.\\\"\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Dr. Keil finds the second and third periods (Eli-Solomon and Solomon to the\\n    Captivity) to have about the right number of names, serving an average of\\n    25-35 years. He adds that notable names such as Jehoiada and Urijah \\\"who\\n    was certainly high priest (2 Kings 16:10 ff)\\\" are omitted, but that some\\n    like Jehoiada might have been known by another name in the Chronicles list\\nand that Urijah was too unimportant to be included.    <a href=\\\"#_ftn4\\\" name=\\\"_ftnref4\\\" title=\\\"\\\">[4]</a>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Remarkably, in the days of King Joash, Jehoiada was the only priest\\n    mentioned from the time he and his wife hid baby Joash until his death late\\n    in Joash's reign. Jehoiada died at the remarkable age of 130 (2 Chronicles\\n    24:15). His career was so distinguished that he was buried among the kings\\n    of Israel. The period from the birth of Joash until the death of Johoiada\\n    late in the king's career suggests he was about 90 years old when he is\\n    first mentioned in Scripture. Certainly his outstanding service to the LORD\\n    had gone on for many years before Joash. He was the face of the priesthood\\n    for 50-60 years, yet his name is not found in either the I Chronicles 6 or\\n    Ezra lists. Either his name was dropped from the list by scribal error or\\n    he was such an effective priest that even if one or more chief priests in\\n    the list ruled during his years of stellar service, they let him represent\\n    them.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The abbreviation of genealogies during the period following David is beyond\\n    the scope of this study. This survey of the high priestly line is for the\\n    purpose of exploring the possibility of omitted chief priests while guiding\\n    readers away from unfounded interpretations. On the other hand, Table 6.14\\n    shows a definite gap in the line of Ezra the priest when placed side by\\n    side with the Chronicles list of high priests. The observations of Dr. Keil\\n    together with our comments on Jehoiada seem to establish a reasonable\\n    possibility that even the line of high priests followed the principle of\\n    selectivity in the records when it could. On the basis of 30 year tenures\\n    we have entered five successive omissions in the first period as well as\\n    several individuals during the second period. But, most importantly, the\\n    high priestly office was a matter of heredity; so, where the correct name\\n    was essential there would be no condensing.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    In addition, many other commentators feel names have been lost from the\\n    list in the process of transmission. I Chronicles records scraps of\\n    information from much earlier sources which a true scribe could not\\n    neglect. So these bits and pieces were recorded for future generations to\\n    unscramble. Inerrancy involves the original writings; transmission is the\\n    process of passing Scripture from generation to generation and does not\\n    provide the same level of protection given by the doctrine of inerrancy. At\\n    present these records are mysteries and, therefore, we need to defer our\\n    judgment to God; for someday He will show us His purposes in such records.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Example 13 Details-Ezra the Priest. </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p class='verse'>\\n    <sup>1</sup>\\n    Now after this in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Ezra the son of\\n    Seraiah, the son of Azariah, son of Hilkiah, <sup>2</sup>son of Shallum,\\n    son of Zadok, son of Ahitub, <sup>3</sup>son of Amariah, son of Azariah, [I\\n    Chronicles 6:9-7 adds \\\"Johanah, Azariah, Ahimaaz, Zadok, Ahitub and\\n    Amariah\\\"], son of Meraioth, <sup>4</sup>son of Zerahiah, son of Uzzi, son\\n    of Bukki, <sup>5</sup>son of Abishua, son of Phinehas, son of Eleazar, son\\n    of Aaron the chief priest&#8230;. Ezra 7:1-5.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Spanning from Aaron to the post-Exile period, Ezra's genealogy, like\\n    David's, is clearly abbreviated. It omits six consecutive chief priests\\n    that are found in the primary record of Aaron's line (I Chronicles 6:1-15).\\n    The omission occurred around the transition from the Judges to the\\n    monarchy. Many think Ezra compiled I Chronicles. Whether or not he did the\\n    fact that he is closely identified with I Chronicles shows he was very\\n    familiar with that record so his omission was clearly intentional.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    In Ezra 7:1-5 Ezra listed his descent all the way back to Aaron, Israel's\\n    first chief priest. He began, \\\"Ezra the son of Seraiah\\\" and used the same\\n    phrase \\\"the son of\\\" or \\\"son of\\\" with each head priest until he reached\\n    Aaron. From Seraiah to Aaron he listed 16 forefathers. One has no clue that\\n    his genealogy is condensed except that in I Chronicles 6:1-15 the same list\\n    is given in the opposite order and contains 22 names from Aaron to Seraiah.\\n    The six names Ezra omits are not an occasional omission here and there,\\n    which might then be the result of scribal error, but are the six\\n    consecutive high priests that are named between Azariah and Meraioth. The\\n    six omitted priests working back from Azariah are 1-Johannan, 2-Azariah, 3-\\n    Ahimaaz, 4-Zadok, 5-Ahitub and 6-Amariah. After passing over those six\\n    consecutive high priests, Ezra continued with \\\"son of Meraioth, son of\\n    Zerahiah\\\" etc. (See both lists side by side in Table 6.13.)\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Viewing the list of high priests found in I Chronicles 6:1-15 in descending\\norder (beginning with Aaron), the six missing priests are the 9    <sup>th</sup> through the 14<sup>th</sup>\\n    (Amariah-Ahitub-Zadok-Ahimaaz-Azariah-Johanan). Ezra may have abbreviated\\n    the list of 22 into 16 for sake of brevity, but then again, there may have\\n    been a deeper reason for omitting the six names.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    If Ezra were uncertain about who was really the chief priest during that\\n    time of two chief priests, perhaps he bypassed the problem by condensing\\n    his genealogy to avoid stating chief priests who functioned as chief\\n    priests but did not officially hold the office of chief priest. Then when\\n    the list in Chronicles was put together, the author(s) decided on recording\\n    a clear line from Eleazar. While this explanation is tentative and does not\\n    explain why those omitted extended beyond the end of Eli's line, whatever\\n    was the reason for omitting six consecutive priests, it is clear that Ezra\\n    did omit them and that this instance adds to the many examples showing that\\n    abbreviating lists was acceptable in Hebrew thinking.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Ezra also omitted up to four generations before his. Nebuchadnezzar slew\\n    his elderly forefather Seraiah. Seraiah's successor, Jehozadak, was the\\n    high priest during the captivity and presumably Seraiah's oldest son.\\n    Jehozadak's son Jeshua was the first high priest when Cyrus the Great\\n    decreed that captives could return to their land. Scripture names six\\n    succeeding high priests. Ezra was not the oldest son and thus successor of\\n    Seraiah so he did not descend from those post-captivity high priests. All\\n    he needed to do was show that he descended from Aaron which qualified him\\n    as a priest so he omits the obscure names between Seraiah and himself.\\n    Table 13a shows Ezra's list side by side with both Aaron's and Eli's.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Examples 14-15 Details-The Temple Singers. </strong>\\n    King David appointed a descendant from each Levite clan to lead\\n    worship-Heman from the clan of Kohath but not a son of Amram (I Chronicles\\n    6:33 with 6:38), Asaph from the clan of Gershom (I Chronicles 6:39, 43) and\\n    Ethan from the clan of Merari (I Chronicles 6:44). None of these men were\\n    descendants of Aaron so none qualified for the office of priest. But all\\n    the descendants of Levi were given to Aaron to assist him in leading Israel\\n    in worship and all three were Levites. Samuel's grandson Heman, the chief\\n    choirmaster, descended from Izhar through Korah the rebel (Table 5.1,\\n    6.16).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Nineteen generations are found beginning with Korah and ending with Heman.\\n    In the same time period the line of Aaron, contemporary with Korah, names\\n    but eleven. We suggest about 26 years per generation in Heman's line, but\\n    35 years per generation in Aaron's line and include five omissions to make\\n    the dates work for Aaron. Heman had 14 sons in his choir (maybe sons and\\n    grandsons) so he was most likely older than David. Like Aaron's line\\n    Asaph's line is also condensed. It has twelve names, skipping about seven.\\n    Ethan's line is even more condensed, containing just ten, thus skipping\\n    about nine generations.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    These three lines span the very important years of Israel's early history,\\n    about 500 years from Aaron to David. To picture the distribution of these\\n    generations Table 6.11b shows them side by side with David and Table 6.15a\\n    shows them side by side with Aaron.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>\\n        Final example of abbreviated genealogies, example 16 Details-Heman\\n    </strong>\\n    . David appointed this grandson of Samuel to the position of chief\\n    Tabernacle choir master. His list is recorded in the chapter on Levite\\n    genealogies, I Chronicles 6. It begins with him in verse 33 and goes all\\n    the way back to the Patriarch Israel in verse 39. In a way it follows the\\n    pattern of the first seven examples, giving tribe, clan, household and\\n    individual, adding only the name Israel. The individual following an\\n    approximately 12 generation gap is Korah (Table 6.02). But from Korah to\\n    Heman are 19 names. That calculates to 26+ year generations so that part of\\n    the list is most likely complete.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The remarkable genealogy of Samuel (Table 6.17) concludes this series of\\n    lists. Words fail to describe the ministry of this godly man in the\\n    spiritual life of Israel. Following his genealogy is a supporting\\n    chronology (Table 6.17a) while Table 17b places his list side by side with\\n    that of Aaron and Eli. Because of so many ties with other lists, his list\\n    is a delightful conclusion to this very detailed chapter on lists. While\\n    many of the date assignments are estimates, they must be close to the true\\n    dates because of so many complementary lists.\\n</p>\\n<h4 id='summary-on-condensed-genealogies'>\\n    Summary on Condensed Genealogies\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\n    This chapter has presented a case for the condensing of numerous\\n    genealogies-those of Aaron, Korah, Dathan, Abiram, On, Achan, the daughters\\n    of Zelophehad, Sheerah, Joshua, Caleb the spy, David, the priesthood of\\n    Israel, Ezra, two Temple singers and Heman. Among the most obvious are\\n    Aaron (Table 6.01), Ezra (Table 6.14) and David (Table 6.11). The case of\\n    Ezra is both straight forward and simple because when comparing his list\\n    with the official list in Chronicles, he omits six consecutive names. Since\\n    it is understood that Ezra the Scribe was heavily involved in editing books\\n    of the Old Testament and he wrote the book of Ezra, he was at the least\\n    very familiar with I Chronicles. This seems to be another iron-clad example\\n    of an abbreviated genealogy.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The case of Aaron is the iron-clad example we used to unlock this subject\\n    in chapter one; however, it requires far more detail to establish than the\\n    block of omissions in Ezra's line. But numerous other examples have been\\n    presented. While a few may legitimately be dismissed through alternative\\n    interpretations, most will remain. Consequently, those of faith have two\\n    duties-both to receive the text of Scripture as the very word of God and to\\n    understand it in the light of how words were used when the text was\\n    written. The great encouragement section of Isaiah begins with a reminder\\n    that while all flesh is grass, \\\"the word of our God will stand forever\\\"\\n    (Isaiah 40:6, 8). Our poor minds must defer to that which stands throughout\\n    eternity.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    While recognizing that the above abbreviated genealogies, at most, make\\n    only a difference of 215-years in the date of creation, they do establish a\\n    precedent for Hebrew genealogies commonly being condensed. If the\\n    genealogies of Genesis 5 and/or 11 bear evidence of condensing, they could\\n    change the date of the Flood by much more than 215-years. They will be\\n    looked at in the next chapter.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <h4 id='confirmation-on-biblical-use-of-genealogies'>Confirmation of the biblical use of genealogies</h4>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    In the summer of 2021 I stumbled across an article on the Internet that\\n    contained the same information I had discovered from Scripture over the\\n    preceding decade and have written in this chapter and the last.

Abraham left Ur and entered Canaan at exactly the\\n    only time when Southern Persia briefly dominated Mesopotamia until 1500\\n    years later. At the other end of this stretch of history Moses lived\\n    precisely when Egyptian history could allow it even though all traces of\\n    Israel's time in Egypt have been erased.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The Pharaoh of Joseph's day gave Jacob's family choice land in the Nile\\n    Delta. Later, Hyksos invaders overcame weak pharaohs and gained control of\\n    parts of Lower Egypt. This allowed the Hebrews considerable freedom since\\n    both peoples were semitic. Some Egyptologist go so far as to say that the\\n    Hebrews were allies of the Hyksos. Scripture doesn't speak of the Hyksos\\n    but does report that Jacob's descendants multiplied until \\\"the land was\\n    filled with them\\\" (Exodus 1:7). Verse eleven reports that a pharaoh set\\n    task masters over them to afflict them \\\"lest they join our\\n    enemies&#8230;and escape from the land\\\".\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Even slavery did not stop Hebrew population growth. So a new policy was\\n    issued: the Hebrew midwives were instructed to kill Hebrew boy babies. When\\n    that didn't work Pharaoh gave the order to cast Hebrew boy babies into the\\n    Nile River. Moses was born at this time. His mother hid him as long as she\\n    could (three months; Exodus 2:2), then cleverly prepared a floating basket,\\n    put her baby inside and placed the basket where Pharaoh's daughter bathed\\n    each day. Pharaoh's daughter spotted the basket, looked inside and saw a\\n    baby boy crying. Scripture says she took pity on him even though she\\n    recognized immediately that the baby was a Hebrew.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The baby's sister had been stationed to watch. She offered to get a Hebrew\\n    nurse. Pharaoh's daughter agreed, the baby's mother came and Pharaoh's\\n    daughter said \\\"Take this child away and nurse him for me, and I will give\\n    you your wages\\\" (Exodus 2:9). When the child grew older, his mother brought\\n    him to Pharaoh's daughter. Because of this remarkable window of\\n    opportunity, one can only imagine how intensely his family worked to\\n    prepare him to live as one of their own in Pharaoh's palace. Also of\\n    importance, Thutmose I would have had to give his daughter permission to\\n    adopt a Hebrew as her own son so he had reasons for giving this permission\\n    and they are open to no end of speculation.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAs to Egyptian history, Amenhotep I was the first pharaoh of the 18    <sup>th</sup> Dynasty and is credited with driving out the Hyksos so he\\n    would have been the pharaoh who enslaved the Hebrews. The next Pharaoh,\\n    Thutmose I, followed the policies of his predecessor, oppressing the\\n    Hebrews. He also expanded the empire into Nubia and penetrated deep into\\n    Syria. He fathered a daughter named Hatshepsut by his royal wife and later\\n    a son, Thutmose II, by a secondary wife. Thutmose II married his older\\n    half-sister and they had one child, a daughter named Neferure. Thutmose II\\n    also fathered a son, Thutmose III, by a lesser wife. Then he died, leaving\\n    Egypt with a two-year-old pharaoh.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Historians use an astronomical event to date the years of Thutmose III. But\\n    it has a major problem. Where it was observed was unrecorded, so it varies\\n    by 20 years depending on whether it was observed from the Delta or up the\\n    Nile at Thebes. Instead of Thutmose III ruling Egypt through an appointed\\n    stand in, Hatshepsut, his aunt, governed the country on her own. Thutmose\\n    III did not take the reins of power until Hatshepsut died 20 years later.\\n    History has concluded he hated her and, in his resentment, did all in his\\n    power to erase her name once he was in charge. In the last few years\\n    Egyptologist have changed this view. They have enough reasons to write a\\n    book but we only have a page to pass on their thinking.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Amenhotep II, the Pharaoh of the Exodus, not his father Thutmose III, was\\n    the Pharaoh who took credit for some of Hatshepsut's accomplishments. It is\\n    speculated that he did this to strengthen his claim to the throne. This\\n    indicates that he was a weak pharaoh. He was the Pharaoh of the Exodus.\\n    Thutmose III actually built his tomb adjacent to that of Hatshepsut who\\n    ruled for him until he was 22. Most likely, she did all she could to\\n    prepare him for a successful life as Pharaoh when he was ready. He\\n    certainly moved forward, building on her prosperous reign, not complaining\\n    about the past once he was in charge.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    History regards Thutmose II as an insignificant pharaoh. Only a small\\n    number of documents exist for his reign. Relief scenes during his reign\\n    depict both him with his wife and his wife alone. Only one major monument\\n    is credited to Thutmose II and that one was completed by his son. Unique\\n    scarab seals were used by each Pharaoh on official documents and other\\n    important works. Because they were extremely small, they were hard to\\n    alter. The number for each Pharaoh is considered indicative of that\\n    Pharaoh's importance. Archaeologists have found 241 for Thutmose I, 65 for\\n    Thutmose II and 463 for Hatshepsut.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Hatshepsut was a prolific builder, commissioning hundreds of construction\\n    projects including the Twin Obelisks, the tallest in the world at the time.\\n    She employed the world-famous architect, Ineni. She produced prodigious\\n    amounts of statuary. She worked on increasing trade and generally conducted\\n    a peaceful rule. Egypt became prosperous under her hand. Whether it was a\\n    baby boy or a nation, her instinct was to nurture, to give the best care\\n    possible.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    For years scholars debated whether she regarded herself as Pharaoh. Now\\n    they are certain she did, making her the 2<sup>nd</sup> confirmed female\\n    pharaoh in Egyptian history. In fact, she claimed her father intended that\\n    she should succeed him. It is thought that she even acted as her father's\\n    regent in his final years, was the power behind her husband's entire rule\\n    as well as those first 20 years of Thutmose III's rule. These ideas are\\n    backed by a consistent domestic and foreign policies. When she did die, due\\n    to the prosperity she left, Thutmose III could begin the first of 16\\n    military campaigns that over 20 years would extend Egypt's power all the\\n    way to the Euphrates. He is considered a military genius and was one of the\\n    most militaristic of all the Pharaohs. One historian called him the\\n    Napoleon of Egypt.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Where is Moses in all this? Moses wrote in Exodus 2:10 that when the Hebrew\\n    nurse brought the child to \\\"Pharaoh's daughter&#8230;he became her son. She\\n    named him Moses, 'Because,' she said, 'I drew him out of the water.'\\\" Thus,\\n    Moses himself claimed that he was both named and adopted by Pharaoh's\\n    daughter. Stephen agrees, saying \\\"Pharaoh's daughter adopted him and\\n    brought him up as her own son (Acts 7:21). Then Stephen adds, \\\"And Moses\\n    was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and he was mighty in his\\n    words and deeds\\\" (Acts 7:22).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Moses had the best education available in one of the greatest dynasties\\n    ever to rule Egypt. His mind was filled with construction and statuary. He\\n    was trained as a military leader by a nation skilled in warfare. For most\\n    of 40 years he had seen his royal mother, Pharaoh Hatshepsut care for\\n    Egypt. He could appreciate freedom within limits, knowing that his people\\n    lived their own lives in a sense while also being used positively for\\n    Egypt's construction projects. But he had no idea how miserable they were,\\n    how mistreated they were. Then, for some unexplained reason, he visited his\\n    people when he was not expected and saw an Egyptian taskmaster unmercifully\\n    mistreating a Hebrew slave. In a fit of anger, he struck down the Egyptian\\n    and buried his body in the sand. When Pharaoh learned of this, he sought to\\n    kill Moses (Exodus 2:15). Moses fled.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The experiences in Egypt would prepare him for the human and natural\\n    challenges to leadership during the 40-years Israel was in the wilderness\\n    and God was unfolding an earth-shaking plan for the Hebrew people. But he\\n    would need other training as well. The next 40 years were spent in the\\n    family of a true servant of the living God coping with the harsh climate of\\n    the wilderness and caring for sheep. Until Moses completed this new\\n    education, he would not be ready to shepherd God's flock.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    As to specific dates, Moses was born in 1526 BC. Most likely Pharaoh's\\n    daughter was younger rather than older at this time, maybe 15 years old.\\n    Possibly ten or fifteen years later she married her half-brother. Moses was\\n    40 in 1486 BC when he slew the Egyptian and fled for his life from Pharaoh\\n    Thutmose III who was in his twenties. It is noteworthy that Moses\\n    successfully fled and covered so much distance as to arrive in Midian.\\n    Egyptologists maintain a range of dates for the 18<sup>th</sup> Dynasty.\\n    They call the most recent dates the Low Chronology while the oldest dates\\n    are called the High Chronology. The biblical dates fall somewhere in the\\n    middle. Wikipedia includes an interesting caution regarding these dates:\\n    \\\"These dates, just as all of the dates of the Eighteenth Dynasty, are open\\n    to dispute&#8230;\\\"<a href=\\\"#_ftn5\\\" name=\\\"_ftnref5\\\" title=\\\"\\\">[5]</a>\\n</p>\\n<br clear=\\\"all\\\"/>\\n<div>\\n    <br clear=\\\"all\\\"/>\\n    <hr align=\\\"left\\\" size=\\\"1\\\" width=\\\"33%\\\"/>\\n    <div id=\\\"ftn1\\\">\\n        <p>\\n            <a href=\\\"#_ftnref1\\\" name=\\\"_ftn1\\\" title=\\\"\\\">\\n                <sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup>\\n            </a>\\n            Unger, <em>Dictionary</em>, 110.\\n        </p>\\n    </div>\\n    <div id=\\\"ftn2\\\">\\n        <p>\\n            <a href=\\\"#_ftnref2\\\" name=\\\"_ftn2\\\" title=\\\"\\\">\\n                <sup><sup>[2]</sup></sup>\\n            </a>\\n            Keil, <em>Chronicles</em>, 141.\\n        </p>\\n    </div>\\n    <div id=\\\"ftn3\\\">\\n        <p>\\n            <a href=\\\"#_ftnref3\\\" name=\\\"_ftn3\\\" title=\\\"\\\">\\n                <sup><sup>[3]</sup></sup>\\n            </a>\\n            Keil, <em>Chronicles</em>, 142.\\n        </p>\\n    </div>\\n    <div id=\\\"ftn4\\\">\\n        <p>\\n            <a href=\\\"#_ftnref4\\\" name=\\\"_ftn4\\\" title=\\\"\\\">\\n                <sup><sup>[4]</sup></sup>\\n            </a>\\n            Keil, <em>Chronicles</em>, 115-116.\\n        </p>\\n    </div>\\n    <div id=\\\"ftn5\\\">\\n        <p>\\n            <a href=\\\"#_ftnref5\\\" name=\\\"_ftn5\\\" title=\\\"\\\">[5]</a>\\n            En.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thutmose III.\\n        </p>\\n    </div>\\n</div>\\n\"},ze={html:\"\\n    <h2>PART III - THE ABBREVIATION OF SHEM'S GENEALOGY</h2>\\n\\n<h2 class=\\\"chapter\\\">\\n    Chapter Seven\\n</h2>\\n<h3 class=\\\"the-ultimate-example-of-condensing\\\">\\n    Shem's List: The Ultimate Example of Condensing\\n</h3>\\n<p>\\n    This chapter will show beyond reasonable doubt that Shem's genealogy listed\\n    in Genesis 11:10-26 consisted of about 45-65 generations, but was condensed\\n    to ten by Moses the biblical author. Thus, it is not a chronology. New\\n    calculations date the Flood 1300-1900 years earlier than Ussher's date. Yet\\n    enormous obstacles hide this fact. For instance, unrecognized are two\\n    unmistakable kinds of change to human longevity following the Flood-the\\n    immediate and gradual declines of lifespans. These distinct kinds of\\n    longevity decline are further obscured by confusing those born before the\\n    Flood with those born after it. Maybe worst of all are the larger age\\n    numbers in the Septuagint which will take the entire next chapter to\\n    address.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Simple words, easy to understand, present ten fathers from Shem to Abraham\\n    in Shem's Genesis 11 genealogy. After explaining that two years after the\\n    Flood Shem was 100 years old when he fathered Arpachshad, the passage\\n    continues the following pattern through Nahor without deviation:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <sup>12</sup>\\n    When Arpachshad had lived 35 years, he fathered Shelah. <sup>13</sup>And\\n    Arpachshad lived after he fathered Shelah 403 years and had ot her sons and\\ndaughters. <sup>14</sup>When Shelah had lived 30 years, he fathered Eber.    <sup>15</sup>And Shelah lived after he fathered Eber 403 years and had\\n    other sons and daughters. Genesis 11:12-15.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The biblical doctrine of inerrancy requires that all Scripture be taken\\n    literally according to its literary type. The literary type here is simple\\n    historical narrative. Thus, we must understand that Arpachshad was a real\\n    person, that at the age of 35 he fathered a son and that his remaining\\n    years were 403. Exact numbers are given for the names that follow as\\n    well-the father's age when he fathered his son and the number of years he\\n    lived afterwards. These numbers are not fiction. They are facts and each\\n    fact is true. However, the verb \\\"to father, to beget\\\" can be understood\\n    narrowly meaning immediate son or broadly meaning someone down the line.\\n    Literally, Shelah can be Arpachshad's immediate offspring or a descendant.\\n    The same is true for any of the other sons in the list. If \\\"to father\\\" is\\n    used anywhere in this list for a descendant down the line rather than an\\n    immediate son, adding the age when he fathered his son to the other numbers\\n    would give an incorrect date for the Flood.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Scripture gives no reason to suspect that a substantial gap exists between\\n    any of these people except between Eber and Peleg. But before getting into\\n    the subject we must strongly affirm that God intended that all down through\\n    history after the writing of Genesis, whenever someone would read the\\n    creation account, whether in the time of David, Jesus or Luther, he would\\n    sense that he was not far from when God created the heavens and the earth\\n    and thus not far from God Himself. In the light of eternity past, creation\\n    was just yesterday. The genealogies of Genesis five and eleven do not allow\\n    a sense of viewing God as acting so far in the past as to be irrelevant or\\n    merely a foggy memory. These two genealogies, rather, show God to be\\n    almighty and loving and that He is unfolding a plan to share Himself with\\n    whoever wants that relationship for all eternity. Any other reading of\\n    these genealogies misses their intent.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    To place this chapter in context, here is the thread of our argument so\\n    far. Chapter one demonstrated that the Levi-Aaron genealogy is abbreviated\\n    unless Israel sojourned in Egypt just 215-years. Chapters two through four\\n    assemble conclusive evidence that Israel sojourned 430-years in Egypt.\\n    Therefore, the Levi-Aaron record is condensed. Chapter five discussed the\\n    convenient flexibility of Hebrew relational terms such as father and son.\\n    Chapter five concluded by recognizing the purpose of Hebrew genealogies:\\n    they connect people with their descendants and ancestors, but generally see\\n    no need for comprehensive lists of names as the secular world does. Chapter\\n    six gave fourteen examples of lineages that are abbreviated.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    With this frame of reference, we can now look at the most obviously\\n    abbreviated genealogy of all, the line of Shem. The evidence is\\n    overwhelming, but is like the proverbial elephant in the room that nobody\\n    seems to notice. Poorly reasoned arguments explain this gap away. Some even\\n    elevate the idea that Shem's line is complete to the level of a doctrinal\\n    statement and make it a test of doctrinal correctness. Nevertheless, the\\n    facts point to Shem's line being shrunk by about four-fifths.\\n</p>\\n<p align=\\\"center\\\">\\n    <strong>Unpacking the Confusion Surrounding Shem's List</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The recorded decline of 225 years in life spans between Eber and Peleg is a\\n    clear sign that Shem's line is abbreviated. Since Hebrew genealogies (apart\\n    from certain lists of kings and priests) are about identifying ancestors\\n    with their descendants and visa-versa, not proving succession, Moses gave\\n    only ten critical names: the Patriarch Shem, the first three generations\\n    born immediately after the Flood, the three names following the large gap\\n    of omitted names and the three names involving Abraham-his grandfather, his\\n    father and him. This efficiency saved Moses the trouble of recording the\\n    omitted 35-55 names.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    By observing the recorded decline per generation just before and after the\\n    Eber-Peleg entry, the approximate number of missing generations can be\\n    estimated. While this approach is simple and straight-forward, much\\n    disinformation must be identified and answered. Before this chapter ends,\\n    we will also address unusual cases of shorter and longer lives as well as\\n    those of Noah and Shem who lived both before and after the Flood.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Recognizing Two Enormous Changes in Human Longevity</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The first three generations born after the Flood-Arpachshad, Shelah and\\n    Eber-all lived about the same number of years (438, 433 and 464). This is\\n    remarkable in that all eight individuals who lived and died before the\\n    Flood each lived twice that long, about 900 years (Adam-930; Seth-912;\\n    Enosh-905; Kenan-910; Mahalalel-895; Jared-962; Methuselah-969; Lamech-777.\\n    Genesis 5:3-31). Then, immediately after the Flood human longevity changed\\n    drastically. It was reduced by half. This is a colossal change, from 900 to\\n    450 years.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    But the record gets even more remarkable because after three generations of\\n    living to the age of 450, man's years appear to decrease by half a second\\n    time. Eber lived 464 years while his son Peleg lived 239 years. The fifth\\n    name, Peleg's son, also lived 239 years while the sixth name, Peleg's\\n    grandson, lived 230 years. The first decrease in lifespans happened\\n    immediately after the greatest disaster ever to strike the earth since\\n    Creation, the Global Flood of Noah's day. But Scripture records no event\\n    whatsoever associated with this second halving. And this second halving is\\n    clear; it is not stated in obscure language; all can read it. The three\\n    named generations following Eber (Peleg-Reu-Serug) lived 239, 239 and 230\\n    years. So, are these two halvings of longevity truly the biblical record?\\n    Yes, the Adam group lived 930, 912, 905, 910, 895, 962, 969, and 777 years\\n    while the Arpachshad group lived just half of that-438, 433 and 464\\n    years-and the Peleg group lived just 1/4<sup>th</sup> of the pre-Flood\\n    group-239, 239, 230 years.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    How could there be such consistency in the midst of such change (900 to 450\\n    to 236)? What could possibly have happened to cause such drastic and\\n    immediate changes in the midst of such similar lifespans? This certainly is\\n    the greatest question in the entire history of human longevity. Such a\\n    great mystery demands a solution. No end of explanations has been offered.\\n    The most common is that the numbers are wrong. Such an answer, however,\\n    raises the issue of the integrity of Scripture and is both unacceptable and\\n    unnecessary. A variation of this is that the numbers in the Masoretic Text\\n    are wrong. One must consult the Septuagint for the correct numbers. Yet\\n    even the LXX shows a 33% drop between them. The entire next chapter will be\\n    devoted to discussing the LXX numbers but in this chapter, we are using the\\n    Masoretic Text numbers.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    So, two sudden drops in human longevity actually happened. Imagine seeing\\n    no problem with eight fathers living to the age of 900, the first three\\n    born after the Flood living only half that long and the next three living\\n    only one-quarter that long when there was no second event to rival the\\n    violence of the Flood. The nature and function of Hebrew genealogies in the\\n    context of the violence of the Flood supplies the answer.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Immediate and Long-Term Changes to Human Longevity</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    In order to solve the mystery of two halvings of human longevity in such a\\n    brief period one must understand that human longevity changed in two ways\\n    due to the Flood. First, it was immediately reset to half of what it was\\n    for those who lived and died before the Flood. In terms of numbers this\\n    reset was from 900 to 450 years. This was an immediate and drastic change\\n    in human longevity. The second change was gradual. Human longevity began to\\n    decrease after the Flood from generation to generation. It continued to\\n    decrease for over two millennia. By way of contrast, no such continual\\n    decrease is found before the Flood. This longevity reset was a new\\n    phenomenon that began with the Flood.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    What was the cause of these two changes and more specifically, how did this\\n    author come to recognize them? As I listened to Creation scientists\\n    beginning in about 1996, I became more and more aware of the severity of\\n    the Flood. At some point this question surfaced: \\\"What did such violence do\\n    to those on the Ark; do I find any hint in Scripture.\\\" Eventually I\\n    realized I must look at longevity charts in terms of those who lived and\\n    died before the Flood versus those born after. Noah and Shem had to be\\n    separated out. They were in a category by themselves. This was a new\\n    approach to charting longevity. It showed that two kinds of changes to\\n    human longevity followed the Flood.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The immediate change to human longevity is clear. At the time of the Flood,\\n    human longevity was reset to half that before the Flood. The genes of those\\n    who boarded the Ark could produce offspring to live 900 years. But when\\n    they got off the ark a year later, their genes could only produce offspring\\n    to live 450 years, not 900. And those are the genes they gave to their\\n    offspring, 450-year genes, not 900-year genes.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    We repeat: to recognize this change in the genes of mankind, one must\\n    compare those who lived and died before the Flood with those born after it.\\n    Eleven generations in the line leading to Christ began before the Flood.\\nEnoch was translated directly to heaven so he did not see death. The 10    <sup>th</sup> and 11<sup>th</sup>, Noah and Shem lived both before and\\n    after the Flood so they must be treated separately. The remaining eight all\\n    died before the Flood and lived about the same number of years-900 years.\\n    Since they died before the Flood, their reproductive genes could not have\\n    been affected by the Flood. For them, whatever the Flood did to those on\\n    the Ark had no impact on their genetic makeup so they gave their offspring\\n    genes to live 900 years.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The very first generation born after the Flood lived only half as long. The\\n    same was true for the second and third generations that followed. They also\\n    lived only half as long as the pre-Flood individuals. There were no\\n    children on the Ark, only eight adults-Noah and his wife, their three sons\\n    and their sons' wives. Before the Flood the people who lived to 900 reached\\n    adulthood at about the age of 100, so that is when they started their\\n    families. Noah's three sons were all under the age of 100 although each had\\n    taken a wife. Each of Noah's sons began his recorded family after the\\n    Flood. Of Noah's three sons Scripture only gives the years for the line of\\n    one, Shem, but the Table of Nations (Genesis 10) indicates a similar and\\n    even parallel pattern of reproduction in the lines of his two brothers.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Shem begat Arpachshad, his first named son, two years after the Flood.\\n    Arpachshad lived 438 years. He begat Shelah who lived 433 years. Shelah\\n    fathered Eber who lived 464 years. In short, before the Flood people lived\\n    about 900 years; those born right after the Flood, about 450 years. For\\n    some reason not explained by Scripture man's new lifespan after the Flood\\n    was just half of what it was before. The Giver of Life no longer enabled\\n    anyone born after the Flood to live to the age of 900. Further, it wasn't\\n    just the first generation born after the Flood that lived only half as\\n    long. It was the first three consecutive generations. The first three\\n    generations in a row born after the Flood lived only half as long as the\\n    entire biblical history of those who lived and died before the Flood. This\\n    cutting of lifespans in half happened at the very time of the Flood.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    But the Flood marked a second way that human longevity changed. This second\\n    change was an on-going change to human lifespans. It was primarily\\n    physical, something about genetic entrophy, but environmental as well, such\\n    as the seasons being more harsh, etc. The causes for this second kind of\\n    change remain to be explored, but their effect is clear. These changes,\\n    whatever they were, slowly drained away much of man's vitality. This second\\n    impact could have taken some time to get started, but it continued to the\\n    end of Moses' days. It resulted in a gradual decline of longevity. It is\\n    reflected in many verses of Scripture which establish an undeniable\\n    pattern. The longest recorded lifespan of any born after the Flood was Eber\\n    who was a third generation post-Flood individual. He lived 464 years. Yet\\n    near the end of Moses' life (about 1410 BC), a man's typical full lifespan\\n    was 70 years (Psalm 90:10). While that decline from Eber (464 years) to\\n    Moses (70 years) was a huge decline, 369 years, it was nevertheless\\n    gradual, happening over the better part of three millennia.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Now we can see why there is such a drastic difference in the lifespans of\\n    Eber and Peleg. Their lifespans are simply the typical lifespans of those\\n    who lived before and after an omission of 35-55 consecutive generations.\\n    While Eber truly lived 464 years, his descendants may have lived more or\\n    fewer than 464 years but slowly their lifespans decreased so that 35-55\\n    generations later people were only living to the age of 239. So, on one\\n    side of this enormous omission of generations Eber truly lived 464 years\\n    while on the other side of this huge gap Peleg truly lived 239 years. In\\n    reality, it was not a halving at all, but it can be mistaken for a halving.\\n    By recording the lifespans of Eber (464 years) and Peleg (239), Moses was\\n    telling his audience that he was skipping the names of 35-55 generations\\n    worth of decline. Peleg was not Eber's immediate son. He was the son born\\n    in that line following all those missing names. Eber truly lived 464 years\\n    and Peleg truly lived 239 years. But that 225 year decline between them was\\n    spread over 35-55 omitted generations.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>\\n        Understanding the Immediate and Long-Term Impacts of the Flood\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The immediate and long-term impacts of the Flood are not difficult\\n    concepts. But they are new, even radical. As I reviewed the thinking of\\n    inerrancy folks on the numbers in Shem's list, I found three general\\n    positions. For instance, after reading my Executive Summary a woman at\\n    church said her high school/college age kids accepted the numbers as\\n    accurate, but were uncertain how to understand them--were they\\n    generalizations or precise; were they complete or not? Her young people\\n    probably represent the average inerrancy believer who does not understand\\n    that sometimes Hebrew genealogies intentionally omit generations.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    At the opposite end of the scale Hebrew scholar Dr. Merrill F. Unger, a\\n    champion of inerrancy, did not hesitate to write clearly and adamantly that\\n    Shem's list omits names although he did not suggest where or how many. In\\n    between these poles is the word I received from Dr. William Barrick,\\n    religion editor for Creation Research Journal. He said that he does not\\n    hear the 2348 or 4004 BC dates in the creation meetings he attends in the\\n    Los Angeles area but on the other hand those speakers don't give earlier\\n    dates either. They simply avoid talking about the subject.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    So, the general thinking among inerrancy believers ranges from uncertainty,\\n    to avoiding the subject, to certainty that the list is incomplete. Barrick,\\n    himself, like Unger feels Shem's list is incomplete. In my own research I\\n    have concluded that not one of the world's 100 leading evangelical,\\n    inerrancy, OT scholars believes Shem's list is complete. The question that\\n    kept troubling me as I began working on this subject eleven years ago was\\n    why none of these scholars had published a satisfactory scheme to account\\n    for the missing time.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    In circulating this idea of an immediate and long-term impact of the Flood,\\n    I have found that about 90-95% of those who understand Scripture to be\\n    inerrant (the foundation of this book) say it makes sense. But the 5-10% of\\n    those who have spent years teaching the Ussher dates for the Flood and\\n    Creation find my ideas difficult to accept. Rather than giving them careful\\n    consideration, they typically go on the offensive. They repeat their\\n    arguments even though this book has systematically shown their arguments to\\n    be defective. In their zeal they don't even seem to understand the answers\\n    this book provides.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The situation is grave. Apart from accepting a biblical solution that\\n    reveals an earlier date for the Flood, the Ussher thinking creation\\n    scientists will continue to discredit the creation science they so\\n    self-sacrificially pursue, in effect, shooting themselves in the foot. I\\n    have been asked how they discredit the very science they use to dismiss\\n    evolution and recognize a Creator. Actually, it should be obvious. By\\n    giving a Flood date that is clearly too late, their critics leap for joy,\\n    announcing to all who will hear that since they are obviously wrong on the\\n    date of the Flood, their creation science surely must be equally flawed.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Credit to Creation Scientists</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Maybe the following line of thinking will help creation scientists to\\n    understand how important their work has been in recognizing the gap in the\\n    Shem genealogy. It is not unreasonable to conclude that only because of\\n    their work could this solution be discovered. Creationists for some 50\\n    years have been plumbing the violence of the Flood. Creation geologists\\n    have pointed to vast formations laid down quickly until they are blue in\\n    the face. Those formations give overwhelming evidence for immediate,\\n    continuous deposition, not over long periods of time. The entire earth\\n    bears a consistent testimony to these formations being deposited rapidly,\\n    suddenly, indicating a steadily rising sea level as Genesis 7: 17-18 says.\\n    Now with this new information revealing the incredible violence of the\\n    Flood, Christians could make sense of these declines in human longevity.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Adding to the work of creation scientists, historical errors that obscured\\n    Shem's line are now corrected (see chapter 13). The recent clarification of\\n    Exodus 12:40 eliminated the 215-year Egyptian sojourn error. In addition,\\n    scholars have discovered how to translate millions of recently discovered\\n    documents written in cuneiform and hieroglyphics. And most recently, the\\n    Dead Sea Scrolls which show the care of copying Scripture and the various\\n    Hebrew textual families that existed between about 50 BC and 70 AD were\\n    discovered and their secrets learned. (See chapter 8.) These findings have\\n    helped correct dozens of misinterpretations in the lives of Abraham and\\n    Jacob. (See chapter 14.) None of this information was available to\\n    Josephus, the church fathers or Ussher.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Those changes to human longevity may have been a direct act of God, a side\\n    effect of the Flood or a combination of the two. Whatever the cause it is\\n    worth pondering the forces the Flood released on the world. First, the\\n    Flood released 500 million years' worth of nuclear decay according to RATE\\n    findings published in 2005. It also released radon and chemicals which are\\n    harmful genetically. In addition, it caused rapid polar reverses. What did\\n    they do to the Ark passengers? With thought many harmful forces could be\\n    listed.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    But one thing is certain. When Shem and his wife got off the Ark and\\n    parented their first son, they gave him genes that only enabled him to live\\n    about 450 years, not 900. When that son, Arpachshad and his wife\\n    procreated, they passed on the only genes they had, those they received\\n    from their parents who lived just 450 years. When Shelah and his wife\\n    procreated, they likewise passed on the same reproductive genes that were\\n    somehow reset at the time of the Flood. That resetting now led to a new\\n    longevity for mankind-450 years instead of 900 years. The first halving of\\n    longevity began with the first generation born after the Flood.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    While the immediate and long-term effects of the Flood were very different,\\n    a big stumbling block to distinguishing between them is the common practice\\n    of including the years of Noah and Shem on a continuous chart of lifespans.\\n    That practice is one of the causes of this 2000-year-old error and will\\n    always hide the correct answer. Noah and Shem must be viewed as special\\n    cases and treated separately. For this a careful explanation is coming up\\n    that will provide the reasons for keeping Noah and Shem from either Adam's\\n    or Shem's chart when viewed for the purpose of declining longevity.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>More Considerations of the Long-Term Impacts of the Flood</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Now for a more careful look at the second impact of the Flood which we call\\n    \\\"The Long-Term Impact of the Flood.\\\" The second halving of human longevity\\n    could also have been a direct act of God or a long-term result of the\\n    violence of the Flood or a combination of the two. But Genesis 8:22\\n    introduces a new possibility: \\\"seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer\\n    and winter, day and night.\\\" While God promised not to send another global\\n    Flood and He promised to continue providing an earth that would sustain\\n    life, it seems that this verse is stating that making a living would take\\n    more effort and planning, and be more precarious. It seems to indicate some\\n    kind of change in the annual processes of nature. However, some\\n    commentators understand this to be a promise that, just as before, there\\n    would continue to be seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and\\n    winter, day and night.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Still, creation scientists favor the view that pre-Flood man lived in a\\n    more predictable, semi-tropical climate unthreatened by natural disasters\\n    and very possibly shielded from solar radiation. Now he would experience\\n    crop failure, four definite seasons, powerful earthquakes, volcanic\\n    activity, violent weather and the Ice Age. Formerly food grew year around,\\n    now there would be seedtime and harvest. Whereas before a more uniform\\n    climate extended from pole to pole year around, now there would be cold and\\n    heat. Near the equator and in desert regions man would learn to survive\\n    during times of intense heat and unpredictable precipitation while near the\\n    poles he would learn to survive in times of intense cold.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Heat and cold would produce deadly storms and killing drought. Even more\\n    ominous, heat in the oceans (estimated as high as 86<sup>o</sup> in some\\n    areas) would produce an ice age while tectonic plate movement would produce\\n    earthquakes and lift mountain ranges into the clouds. Additionally, the\\n    human gene pool would acquire mutations that reduced fitness and thus\\n    longevity. While the above view may be somewhat modified over the years by\\n    creation scientists, there currently is much to commend it.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    These changes placed unique stresses on mankind. Scripture says the Ark\\n    landed in the mountains of Ararat, but that name was given after the\\n    mountains formed. Many of those mountains are volcanoes. Mount Ararat\\n    itself would eventually grow to 17,000 feet above sea level and the entire\\n    region would rise to become a plateau nearly 3000 feet high, much of it\\n    volcanic rock. Rising mountains and volcanism were happening worldwide.\\n    These volcanoes released ash that blanketed the earth for centuries and\\n    lowered summer surface temperatures significantly. Migration to Lower\\n    Mesopotamia and on to Arabia and the southern Mediterranean brought some\\n    relief from the volcanic activity and the growing cold.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    If this view is correct the new world certainly contributed to the second\\n    effect of the Flood, although it may not have been the primary cause of\\n    this second effect. It seems that this second effect gradually wore away\\n    the vitality of mankind, producing a continuous decline of longevity.\\n    Because the decline was gradual and continued from the Flood until Moses,\\n    Shem's list must reflect it. The first records of decline between\\n    generations were five and 4.5 years. Such a small decline is only about a\\n    1% difference in lifespans between generations. We are dealing with\\n    averages, but averages are made up of different numbers and each individual\\n    is different. So, in the midst of such small changes, one might not think\\n    of occasional variations of, say 25 (5%) or even 50 (10%) years as unusual\\n    and that is true. But the decline between Eber and Peleg was not the\\n    standard 4.5 or five years or even 25 or 50 years. It was an enormous 225\\n    year decline, 61% of the entire decline from the Flood until Moses. To\\n    visualize all the average generations needed to produce a 225-year decline,\\n    the next paragraph explores such calculations.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The first six names in Shem's list provide differences over five\\n    generations. The difference between the first and second names, Arpachshad\\n    and Shelah, was just five years. The difference between the second and\\n    third names was 31 years but these 31 years were an increase in lifespans,\\n    not a decrease. But the increase was not 450 years (a 100% increase) so as\\n    to give Eber a lifespan like that of pre-Flood people, but simply an\\n    increase of 6.5% over that of his father and grandfather. The difference\\n    between the fourth and sixth names was nine years or an average of 4.5\\n    years per generation. On this basis of 4.5-5 years of decline per\\n    generation, if one generation was omitted, on average the grandson would\\n    live nine or ten fewer years and this would be reflected in his reported\\n    lifespan. The son following an omission of four generations would live\\n    18-20 fewer years. The son following an omission of eight generations would\\n    live 36-40 fewer years. The son following an omission of 16 generations\\n    would live 72-80 fewer years. The son following an omission of 32\\n    generations would live 144-160 fewer years. Now we get to the actual number\\n    given in Scripture, the 225 year decrease between Eber and Peleg: on the\\n    basis of a 4.5-5 year average generational decline, that son would follow\\n    the omission of 45-50 generations.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The first thought that comes to mind is that Peleg was an exception. But\\n    this cannot be, because his son Reu also lived to the same age. If Peleg\\n    died due to an accident or sickness, Reu would have lived 8-10 years fewer\\n    than Eber, but he also lived 225 fewer years than Eber. Even if both Peleg\\n    and Reu were exceptions, one would expect Reu's son Serug to have lived\\n    simply 13.5-15 fewer years than Eber, but he lived 234 fewer years than\\n    Eber. Peleg was not an exception. He lived a normal lifetime and no one\\n    born after him is recorded to have lived longer than he lived. His lifespan\\n    testifies to being born many generations after Eber. Thus, beget is used in\\n    the broad sense of Peleg being the son of Eber through many intermediate\\n    fathers. Modern terminology would call Peleg a descendant of Eber. Next, we\\n    must carefully document the gradual but continual decline of longevity\\n    between the Flood and Moses.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Specific Records of Longevity Decline</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    We previously saw that there was no decline of longevity over the\\n    generations that lived and died before the Flood. To repeat: on average\\n    each person in Adam's list (Genesis 5) who lived and died before the Flood\\n    lived about 900 years. Now we are ready to examine the post-Flood record\\n    which reflects a gradual but continuing decline of longevity in contrast to\\n    the pre-Flood record of no longevity decline at all. The decline from the\\n    first generation (Arpachshad-438 years) to second generation (Shelah-433\\n    years) of those born after the Flood was five years. Shelah's son Eber\\n    lived longer than his father or grandfather and is an exception that we\\n    will deal with later.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The next three names in Shem's list are the fourth, fifth and six names.\\n    They come immediately after the gap between Eber and Peleg. Both Peleg and\\n    his son Reu lived 239 years while Reu's son Serug lived to the age of 230.\\n    Thus, there was no decline between the fourth and fifth names, but the\\n    sixth named person, Serug lived nine fewer years than either his father or\\n    grandfather. This nine year decline produces an average decline of 4.5\\n    years per generation. Thus, the two periods record declines of five years\\n    from the first to the second names and nine years from the fourth to the\\n    sixth names. Apart from the 31 year increase from Shelah to Eber, these are\\n    the first specific records of lifespans after the Flood and they are nearly\\n    identical. Five to 4.5 years per generation is a change of a mere half year\\n    per generation in 35 to 55 generations.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Our third set of specific lifespans comes from Jacob's record which jumps\\n    down to the time in Canaan and Egypt, about 600 years after the second\\n    measure and two millennia after the first measure. Jacob lived to the age\\n    of 147. His son Levi lived to the age of 137. Levi's son Kohath lived to\\n    the age of 133 and Kohath's son Amram lived to the age of 137. A casual\\n    look finds the total decline from Jacob to Amram (four fathers or three\\n    generations) was 10 years (147-137=10) or 3.3 years per generation. A more\\n    careful look at this apparent decline will be offered later. At least on\\n    the surface we have a specific recorded decline of five years per\\n    generation immediately after the Flood, a specific recorded decline of 4.5\\n    years per generation for two generations between one and two millennia\\n    later and a possible recorded decline of 3.3 years per generation over\\n    three generations half a millennium after that.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Now we jump down to a clear final decline of man's longevity, from Amram to\\n    Moses. They also were in the line of Levi. While the final notice of\\n    decline was Psalm 90:10 in which Moses wrote that man's lifespan would be\\n    70 or 80, these lifespans reflected the judgment of God on Israel's\\n    unbelief and the resulting death of an entire generation in the wilderness.\\n    In contrast Moses lived to the age of 120. Since Israel completed their 40\\n    years in the desert in 1406 BC, Moses was born in 1526 BC. While the exact\\n    date of his forefather Amram is not known, Scripture says Amram was born in\\n    Egypt, married a daughter of Levi and his father was apparently an adult,\\n    so we place his birth shortly after the beginning of the Egyptian sojourn,\\n    say about 1870 BC. Thus we are measuring from birth to birth rather from\\n    death to death since these are the firmer numbers. Amram lived 137 years\\n    and Moses 120 years, so the decrease in longevity was 17 years. The years\\n    that passed are as follows: 1870 &amp; 1527 or 244 years. The generations\\n    involved are: 244/25=10. Thus declining longevity was 1.7 years per\\n    generation in this final measure.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    So, Scripture provides four rough measures of lifespans over about 2500\\n    years. Immediately after the Flood man's lifespan 450 years. Then, 1500\\n    years later it was 236 years. Five hundred years after that it was down to\\n    140 and yet 500 years still later it stood at 120. Would anyone question\\n    that Scripture charts a continual decline of longevity from the Flood to\\n    the birth of Moses 2.5 millennia later. It would seem this gradual decline\\n    adequately explains the halving between Eber and Peleg. Most definitely God\\n    had given Abraham's line unusual strength and longevity. Many of the\\n    biblical numbers are at the high end of human longevity. This is especially\\n    seen in Levi's line concluding with Moses and his two siblings who all\\n    reached the age of 120 or more at the point where the average lifespan was\\n    70. But even working with numbers that are at the high end of longevity\\n    there was still a clear and continuous decline from the Flood to the birth\\n    of Moses.\\n</p>\\n<h3>\\n    Two Standards for Starting New Generations\\n</h3>\\n<p>\\n    Knowing the number of missing generations is one of two numbers needed to\\n    determine the time of the Flood. The years represented by each generation\\n    must also be known. Then the number of missing generations will be\\n    multiplied by the years in a generation to determine how many years are\\n    missing between Eber and Peleg. The years in a generation will also be used\\n    when the total number of years is known but the number of generations is\\n    not known as in the case of the Egyptian sojourn.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    As the records are studied it is apparent that as longevity decreased, the\\n    years to adulthood and thus producing offspring also decreased. While one\\n    might suspect this to be true, the record clearly shows it did happen.\\n    Those who lived about 900 years started families when they were about 100.\\n    While this does not help us find any missing generations before the Flood,\\n    it strongly establishes the concept of declining years to adulthood being a\\n    function of declining longevity. For our specific task we use 32 years to\\n    represent adulthood between Arpachshad and Jacob and 20 years in the period\\n    after Jacob, a total of 12 years decline in reaching adulthood after the\\n    Flood.\\n</p>\\n<h4>\\n    1. Standard Number One: 32 years\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\n    In the first grouping following the Flood (Arpachshad-Shelah-Eber),\\n    families began when fathers were 35, 30 and 34 or an average age of 33. In\\n    the second grouping (Peleg-Reu-Serug-Nahor), families began when the\\n    fathers were 30, 32, 30 and 29 or an average age of 30.25. To average all\\n    seven, we sum them (35+30+34+30+32+30+20=220) and divide by seven\\n    (220/7=31.43). To remain conservative and for sake of ease we rounded this\\n    number up to 32. Thirty-two then becomes the average number of years in\\n    each generation missing between Eber and Peleg. By way of example if ten\\n    generations were missing between Eber and Peleg, 320 years would need to be\\n    added to the Shem line total to determine the time of the Flood (32 x 10 =\\n    320).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Following the first seven fathers named above, the next four fathers\\n    started families very late due to unusual circumstances: Terah at age 70,\\n    Abraham at age 86, Isaac at age 60 and Jacob at age 82. Each was an\\n    extraordinary situation. Infertility was the difficulty in the first three\\n    occasions, each of which involved Terah's line. For some reason he did not\\n    father Abraham until he was 130. Scripture specifically states that Sarah,\\n    Abraham's wife and an offspring of Terah, was barren. By divine\\n    intervention she and Abraham had their first and only son when Abraham was\\n    100. Abraham's son Isaac was also married to a descendant of Terah and did\\n    not father an offspring by his wife Rebekah until God answered his prayer\\n    for offspring twenty years after they were married (Genesis 25:21). By that\\n    time Isaac was 60.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Jacob's situation is more unusual yet. Since Abraham arranged a marriage\\n    for Isaac when Isaac was 40, Jacob and his twin brother Esau likely\\n    expected that their father would arrange a marriage for them when they\\n    turned 40. Unfortunately, Isaac did not. When Isaac did not act Esau took\\n    not one but two Canaanite wives. They so distressed his mother that Jacob,\\n    being sensitive to his mother's feelings, decided to wait. It would be\\n    another 42 years before Jacob was married and his first child was born.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Determining the beginning of new generations on the basis of Terah,\\n    Abraham, Isaac and Jacob would miss the average by a country mile. Yet,\\n    their ages are frequently used as the measure of a generation and this is\\n    one of the reasons our declining longevity argument has been so well\\n    hidden. Since they are unusual cases, we will use the standard of 32 years\\n    derived from Arpachshad through Nahor in determining generations from the\\n    Flood down to the time of Jacob. In this way Terah being 130 when he begat\\n    Abraham represents four normal generations while Abraham fathering Isaac at\\n    the age of 100 represents three typical generations.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    In the same way Isaac fathering the twins at the age of 60 represents two\\n    generations and Jacob beginning his family at the age of 82 represents\\n    nearly three generations. So while one might protest about a 5-4.5 year\\n    decline of longevity per generation and point to the 30 year decline\\n    between Terah and Abraham, that decline must be viewed in terms of four\\n    generations. This concept is further strengthened when one considers the 25\\n    year decline from Terah to Isaac. It happened over the equivalent of seven\\n    generations. When viewed that way, the 5-4.5 year decline is in the ball\\n    park (25/7 = 3.5 year decline per generation). On the other hand, Abraham\\n    and Jacob lived more stressful lives than Isaac.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Another confirmation of this general principle is that as longevity\\n    decreased so did the potential start of each new generation. Eber and Peleg\\n    started their families at 34 and 30. But those after Jacob started their\\n    families even before the age of 20. Thus the age for reaching adulthood\\n    gradually declined to about 20 by the period following Jacob.\\n</p>\\n<h4>\\n    2. Standard Number Two: 25 years\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\n    Above we stated that the age of adulthood after Jacob was around 20. That\\n    is the record. But in the following discussion we will show that reaching\\n    adulthood and starting a family did not coincide as it did in the\\n    generations after the Flood when God's command to repopulate the earth was\\n    paramount. So we have decided on age 25 for starting new generations in\\n    this second time span.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Again Scripture provides us with much useful data-in this case, Jacob's\\n    extended family that accompanied him to Egypt (Genesis 46:8-27). While\\n    Jacob started his family in his 80's and even his twin brother waited until\\n    he was 40, Jacob's sons began having families in their twenties and even\\n    before they were twenty. Case in point: we know the most about Judah's\\n    fathering in the years before the relocation to Egypt when Judah was 45. In\\n    those 45 years Judah grew up, married and fathered three sons. Furthermore,\\n    his three sons grew up, two married and the third reached the age of\\n    marriage all in the same 45 years. Then Judah committed incest with the\\n    widow of his second son, thereby starting a third generation family. His\\n    second group of sons (twins by his daughter-in-law) should have been\\n    grandsons. This works out to starting the next generation when he was 23\\n    and the third when he was 45-two generations in 45 years or 22.5 years per\\n    generation.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Some will protest that this was an unusual circumstance and requires an\\n    adjustment. Having sons through his daughter-in-law certainly was unusual.\\n    What should have happened is that when his first son was married at the age\\n    of 20, that son should have fathered a child instead of spilling his seed\\n    on the ground so that the LORD slew him. Then these two successive\\n    generations would have started when the fathers were 23 and 21 or an\\n    average of 22 years per father.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    But that is not all. The second family Judah fathered consisted of\\n    twins-Zerah and Perez. The twins were born just before or just after the\\n    move to Egypt. But those named who moved to Egypt include two sons of Perez\\n    even though they were still in the womb and would not be born for another\\n    20 or 25 years (Genesis 46:12). If this were not the case, a fourth\\n    generation would have been added to Judah's line by the time he was 45.\\n    This would amount to new generations starting when each father was 15 years\\n    old which is highly unlikely. Since Hebrew genealogies are flexible, the\\n    writer of this part of Genesis chose to provide a fuller record of Jacob's\\n    lineage in Egypt, so he included sons still in the womb who would be born\\n    in Egypt.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The record of Benjamin tops them all, further illustrating the idea of sons\\n    born to a very young father and even including unborn sons in this\\n    extensive list of Jacob's heirs that accompanied him to Egypt. Benjamin was\\n    24 when they moved to Egypt in 1876 BC. Genesis 46:21 lists ten sons for\\n    him! If they were all alive at the time of the move Benjamin would have had\\n    to have multiple wives and start having sons in his teens. Most likely some\\n    were grandsons or even great grandsons. Further, several are attributed to\\n    another of Jacob's sons in another passage, so apparently a scribal error\\n    contributes to the confusion, but a few must have been alive at the time of\\n    the move meaning he was in his late teens or early twenties when he started\\n    his family.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Three sons are listed for Levi (Exodus 6:16) who was 46 at the time of the\\n    move. Since no sons are listed for Kohath at the time of the move, Kohath's\\n    son Amram was born after the move to Egypt. Consequently, Kohath could have\\n    been an adult at the time of the move. Amram married a daughter Levi\\n    fathered after the move (Numbers 26:59). So unless she was born when Levi\\n    was elderly, the two male generations, Kohath and Amram, must have been\\n    born when their fathers were in their mid-twenties.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    At the time of the move Jacob's sons ranged from age 48 for Reuben to age\\n    39 for Joseph plus Benjamin who came along later and was 24. Each of\\n    Jacob's sons had at least one named son at the time of the move\\n    demonstrating the vigor of his line. It seems that some of his fifty plus\\n    grandsons were well beyond infancy. All of this points to the sons of Jacob\\n    starting families in their teens and twenties.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    By the time of the Exodus 430-years later all able-bodied males aged 20-50\\n    served in Moses' citizen army to defend their infant nation. Presumably, if\\n    a 20 year old was considered old enough to risk his life in defense of his\\n    country, he was also old enough to marry and start a family. So the decline\\n    of longevity to the age of 70 was accompanied the decline in reaching\\n    adulthood at the age of 20. As stated above this would be a decline in\\n    reaching maturity of 12 years.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    However, those early generations needed to repopulate the earth so they\\n    started families as soon as they were able. As we have seen, Jacob's sons\\n    were commonly starting families by the age of 20. Thus the potential age\\n    for starting families shrunk from 32 to 20. Nevertheless, for our purposes\\n    we need averages, not potential. By the time Israel was in Egypt and after,\\n    even though young men could potentially start families at 20, they had the\\n    leisure of starting them later and many examples are found of those who\\n    started families later, even Joseph the step-father of Jesus. As a result\\n    we suggest using the age of 25 for determining generations during this\\n    period. Using 25 rather than 20 decreases the number of generations in\\n    Egypt by 20%.\\n</p>\\n<h3>\\n    Estimates of Omitted Generations and Year of the Flood\\n</h3>\\n<p align=\\\"center\\\">\\n    (See also Appendix Table 7.4)\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Now we can estimate when the Flood happened, but this estimate is only a\\n    broad range of years, not a specific year. Following that will be an\\n    explanation of how these numbers were reached and the many variables. By\\n    recognizing omitted generations between Eber and Peleg the Flood dates\\n    between 4300 and 3600 BC. These dates are particularly encouraging to those\\n    who accept the Bible as divinely inspired because they encompass the\\n    earliest well-established post-Flood civilizations of mankind revealed by\\n    overwhelming secular evidence. In fact, Scripture indicates that those who\\n    got off the Ark quickly established an advanced civilization. Further,\\n    these numbers provide more years than the LXX which some creationists are\\n    resorting to.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The maximum date for the Flood is found by recognizing a 225 year decline\\n    between Eber and Peleg, an average decline of 4.5 years per generation and\\n    a 200 year quiet period immediately following the Flood to restart life. By\\n    dividing the total decline (225 years) by the decline per generation (4.5\\n    years), 50 generations are found to be missing (225/4.5=50). The 200 quiet\\n    years give another 6.25 generations for a total of 56.25 generations. Since\\n    generations started every 32 years, by these considerations 1800 years are\\n    missing between Eber and Peleg (32x56.25=1800).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Before the gap is a period of 101 years-the two years until the birth of\\n    Arpachshad, the 35 until he fathered Shelah, the 30 until Shelah fathered\\n    Eber and the 34 until Eber fathered the first unrecorded generation\\n    (2+35+30+34=101). By including the years until the birth of the first\\n    unknown generation (101) and the years from the birth of Peleg to Christ\\n    (2417), the maximum date of the Flood would be 4318 BC or 4300 BC for a\\n    round number (1800+101+2417=4318).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The minimum date for the Flood is found by assuming that Eber had\\n    extraordinary vigor and that if he had been average, he would have lived\\n    five fewer years than his father Shelah. Using 189 years of total decline\\n    between Eber and Peleg and five years for the average decline sets the\\n    number of missing generations at 37.8. Assuming also that during the most\\n    severe part of the Ice Age longevity decreased more rapidly, we round those\\n    generations down to 35. Multiplying 35 by the exact number of years per\\n    generation (31.43) calculates to 1100 years missing from the record\\n    (31.43x35=1100). Adding the years in the gap to those before and after\\n    gives the minimum time of the Flood as 3618 BC (1100+101+2417=3618).\\n    Rounding 3618 to the nearest 100 gives a round figure range of 3600-4300\\n    BC.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    A friend saw these estimates of the missing generations between Eber and\\n    Peleg and took strong exception. He said four calendars from different\\n    parts of the world (China, India, Europe and the Americas) all point to\\nabout 4000 BC as the beginning of the earth. He said to read    <em>After the Flood</em> by Bill Cooper. Amazingly, Cooper cited three\\n    calendars that he felt were free of major internal contradictions. All\\n    three placed creation at 4700 BC or earlier. Of the three he considered the\\n    Parker Chronicle to be the most reliable. It is Anglo-Saxon and places\\n    creation at 5200 BC.<a href=\\\"#_ftn1\\\" name=\\\"_ftnref1\\\" title=\\\"\\\">[1]</a> By\\n    adding the biblical years before the Flood (1656) to our range of Flood\\n    dates (4300-3600 BC), creation falls in the range of 5956-5256 BC which is\\n    not that much greater than the Parker Chronicle and our dates come solely\\n    from studying God's Word.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>\\n        Calculating Peleg's Year of Birth (See also Appendix Table 7.1)\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    This paper tags 2417 BC as the year of Peleg's birth. The trail to that\\n    date begins with Jacob's move to Egypt in 1876 BC, the standard date\\n    preferred by Evangelicals. When he came to Egypt, Pharaoh asked his age.\\n    Jacob replied that he was 130 years old (Genesis 47:9). By adding 130 to\\n    the 1876 BC date, we find Jacob was born in 2006 BC (1876+130=2006). Isaac\\n    was 60 when Jacob was born (2006+60=2066). Abraham was 100 when Isaac was\\n    born (2066+100=2166). By adding the numbers for the years of five previous\\n    fathers (Terah-130; Nahor-29; Serug-30; Reu-32; Peleg-30 = 251), we find\\n    Peleg was born about 2417 BC (2166 + 251 = 2417).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The year Levi was born is determined as follows. Joseph was elevated at the\\n    age of 30 (Genesis 41:46). Seven years of plenty and two years of famine\\n    had passed so Joseph was 39 when Pharaoh asked his father's age and Jacob\\n    replied that he was 130. Thus Joseph was born when his father was 91\\n    (130-39=91) which would place Joseph's birth at 1915 BC (2006-91=1915).\\n    Joseph was the youngest of the eleven sons born to Jacob in Haran in just\\n    nine years so his oldest brother Reuben would have been born in 1924 BC\\n    (1915+9=1924) and the third oldest, Levi would have been born in 1922 BC\\n    (1924-2=1922).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Individuals not fitting the pattern</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Averages must be protected from exceptions and unusual circumstances. Both\\n    unusually vigorous people and people with lifespans considerably less than\\n    the average must be treated with care and when justified appropriate\\n    adjustments must be made. Possibly such a case is Eber, the third\\n    generation descendant of Shem who lived 464 years which is 31 years longer\\n    than his father Shelah (433 years). With Eber longevity increased rather\\n    than decreased. This is contrary to the general trend so he was likely\\n    unusually vigorous, but just how vigorous? His father and he could be\\n    treated like Peleg and Reu who both lived to the age of 239 immediately\\n    after the gap. With that adjustment Eber would be considered as living 433\\n    years like his father. Or apart from unusual vitality again for sake of\\n    averages, he could be counted as living five fewer years than his father\\n    just as his father lived five fewer years than his grandfather. That would\\n    establish his lifespan at 428 years for the sake of averages and produce a\\n    longevity decline of 189 years (428-239=189). This would calculate to 38\\n    missing generations (189/5=38) or 1216 years (32x38=1216) and place the\\n    Flood at 3734 BC (2517+101+1216=3734 BC). More on Eber later.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Following Serug was Nahor who lived a short 148 years. He does not fit the\\n    pattern. Maybe he was sickly but more likely he died from violence or in\\n    some kind of accident. (Similarly, we suspect Lamech died from violence.)\\n    So his years do not contribute to our search for the average decline per\\n    generation. But a minor skipping of generations may have occurred between\\n    Serug and Nahor. In David's line were three groups of three consecutive\\n    individuals with a relatively equal number of omissions between each group\\n    of three. If Moses were skipping two groups of names, the second gap would\\n    fall between Serug and Nahor. However, the decline between Serug and\\n    Nahor's son is only 25 years. At most 25 years only represents five or six\\n    generations and such a small number (25 years) is not beyond the deviation\\n    from averages.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    We have already mentioned his son, Terah, who also does not fit the pattern\\n    already established. While his grandfather Serug lived 230 years, Terah\\n    lived 205 years, a 25 year decrease over two generations. Further he bore\\n    his first son at the age of 70 while all the preceding fathers born after\\n    the Flood fathered their first sons between the ages of 29 and 35. For\\n    these reasons we feel that the records of Nahor and Terah do not fit the\\n    clear pattern of the three born before the gap and the three born after the\\n    gap, so we are not using them in our search for the average years of\\n    longevity decline after the Flood.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Another exception could be Jacob's years. He describes how Laban exploited\\n    him for 20 years (Genesis 31:38-42). He was like a slave to Laban. After\\n    returning to Canaan he appointed Joseph to supervise his older brothers. He\\n    might have done this because he was worn out by that time. You might say he\\n    worked himself to death and thus died sooner than he would have otherwise.\\n    Thus, he most likely died younger than if he had not worked so hard.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    An entirely different consideration is the work of God in judging unbelief\\n    while giving certain leaders and the line of Christ greater years and\\n    vitality. History records that in the early second millennium BC pharaohs\\n    were living about 60 years. Yet Joseph lived 110 years and each of those\\n    first three fathers in the line of Levi lived about 135 years. Even more\\n    startling four centuries later Mariam, Aaron and Moses all lived 120 years\\n    or more. Yet Moses wrote in his final days that a full lifetime was 70\\n    years (Psalm 90:10). Possibly God supernaturally granted more years to\\n    Moses and his siblings in order to found the nation.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    However, the 70 year standard might have been related to the judgment of\\n    God on the Exodus generation. Because of their unbelief God said they would\\n    not enter the Promised Land. Hebrews three relates that an entire\\n    generation other than those who believed God perished in the wilderness. It\\n    could be that the 70 year standard Moses wrote of took more time to become\\n    fully established after his death.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <a name=\\\"_Hlk75171914\\\"><strong>Noah and Shem</strong></a>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Noah and his son Shem are special cases in a category by themselves. Since\\n    both were born before the Flood they received the genes that called for 900\\n    year life spans. As a result, both lived a long time after the Flood-Noah\\n    350 years and Shem 500 years. There are reasonable explanations for how\\n    they could live so many years after the Flood when the new normal lifespan\\n    of those born after the Flood was 450 years. It is common medical knowledge\\n    that genes given at birth plus those replacements in one's early years have\\n    the most effect on one's lifespan. Noah was 600 years old when the Flood\\n    came. His physical body developed for 600 years under pre-Flood conditions.\\n    Certainly his walk with God gave him extra vitality. Because of all those\\n    pre-Flood years, the new conditions after the Flood most likely had less\\n    effect on him. If he had lived his entire lifetime before the Flood,\\n    perhaps he would have lived over 1000 years and set the record for the\\n    longest lifespan in human history. He also lived during those first two\\n    hundred years after the Flood that may have been a quiet time especially\\n    given by God for the Ark passengers to get on their feet before the Ice Age\\n    began taking its toll.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    While Noah lived 1/3 of his life after the Flood, Shem lived 5/6ths of his\\n    life after the deluge. He only had 100 years to develop his body before the\\n    hard times following the Flood. Without the impact of the Flood Shem most\\n    likely would have lived 900 years like his forefathers. Thus, it must be\\n    that those 500 years after the Flood had a much greater impact on his body\\n    than the 350 years his father lived after the Flood had on his father's\\n    body. As his father's heir, possibly the burdens of leadership and\\n    especially upholding faith in God after the Flood could well have taken\\n    their toll on his lifespan.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    He may also have chosen to remain in the growing mountains of Ararat where\\n    the climate was more severe rather than in the Mesopotamian civilization\\n    bowl where Noah's descendants were defying God at Babel. His life may even\\n    have been cut short by accident or violence. So while Shem was not given\\n    those post-Flood genes which would have cut his life to 450 years, his body\\n    did bear the impact of living under the new conditions far more than it did\\n    on his father's body. Thus, Noah and Shem must not be cited in the\\n    averages. To include them is to compare oranges with apples and thus to\\n    obscure the powerful impact the Flood had on human longevity.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <a name=\\\"_Hlk75171983\\\">\\n        <strong>Further Considerations on Eber, the Wild Card</strong>\\n    </a>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Eber lived 31 years longer than his father Shelah and 26 years longer than\\n    his grandfather who was born two years after the Flood. This might indicate\\n    that longevity actually increased in the third generation or at a minimum\\n    that there was no overall longevity decrease in the early years after the\\n    Flood. But again, for some unexplained reason God may have given Eber\\n    greater vitality. Or, it might have been like this-God may have sent a\\n    quiet period giving the eight ark survivors and their new families time to\\n    transition from food supplies on the ark to farming and shepherding. They\\n    also may have spent years salvaging the building materials used in the\\n    ark's construction, moving them to a safe location before the Ice Age\\n    gained momentum. Possibly Eber's father and grandfather in effect worked\\n    themselves to an early grave as they labored to restart human life after\\n    the Flood so Eber had it a little easier. Eber could have lived in the\\n    Mesopotamian basin where the Ice Age had less effect while Shem could have\\n    stayed in regions closer to the Ararat Mountains and more severe weather.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Possibly Eber's 464 years is the true longevity number for those first\\n    generations after the Flood. So enjoying unusual vitality, having it a\\n    little easier or not being the victim of sickness, an accident or foul play\\n    could explain Eber's longer lifespan. Because we do not know why Eber lived\\n    longer, he is something of a wild card. Just how one sees Eber's longer\\n    lifespan will affect his view of the number of years missing between Eber\\n    and Peleg. This uncertainty and the many exceptions previously noted\\n    require humility in approaching our subject and remind us again that God\\n    has only chosen to give us a general idea of the time of the Flood and not\\n    a more exact time.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Finally, we must recognize that the entire period from Eber to Moses was\\n    one of continuous, gradual declining longevity, but it would seem that the\\n    decline would not be a straight line. Rather it would be faster or slower\\n    depending on the level of stress and the location of the individual.\\n    Stressful conditions such as living in the teeth of the Ice Age or living\\n    as a slave would certainly reduce longevity faster. Yet even as some bore\\n    the rigors of the Ice Age the far greater population lived in the more\\n    agreeable climates of Southern Mesopotamia and Arabia. Maybe warfare and\\n    violence did as much to decrease their longevity as natural conditions.\\n    Nevertheless, the amount of generational decline most likely varied from\\n    region to region and from period to period. Our records come mostly from\\n    just one family line so they reflect the region and the period of that\\n    line's experiences.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <a name=\\\"_Hlk75448735\\\"><strong>Shem's List - Not a Chronology</strong></a>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    This chapter has presented strong evidence that Shem's genealogy in Genesis\\n    11:10-26 is not a chronology. But those begetting numbers have great value\\n    as they reveal that the Flood marked both an immediate and long term\\n    decline in human longevity. Further, they disclose the vast difference\\n    between pre-Flood and post-Flood conditions. Most importantly, they show\\n    the effects of sin.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    It was easy to conclude Shem's list was a chronology because the begetting\\n    age of each father is given, ten consecutive fathers with eight consecutive\\n    begetting numbers. But like a red flag Scripture does not add those numbers\\n    even though it gives important chronological totals elsewhere such as the\\n    430-years in Egypt (Exodus 12:40) and the 480 years from the Exodus to the\\n    Temple (I Kings 6:1). In fact it neither invites the reader to add those\\n    numbers nor even gives a single hint that those numbers should be\\n    considered a chronology. While the silence of Scripture does not close the\\n    issue, it is a strong witness against the chronology argument.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    But Shem's list does give an obvious clue that its objective was something\\n    other than a chronology. It's ten names are matched by ten names in Adam's\\n    list. Symmetry, not chronology appears to be the goal of placing ten names\\n    in each list. Ten representative names from Adam to Noah and ten more from\\n    Shem to Abraham beginning the line to the Redeemer first promised in\\n    Genesis 3:15.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Viewing Shem's list as a chronology is an interpretation, not a fact.\\n    Interpretations of Scripture and facts of Scripture must be carefully\\n    distinguished. The Gospel is a fact. That Jesus is the predicted Messiah of\\n    the OT is a fact. That Shem's list is a chronology doesn't qualify as a\\n    fact. A special branch of bibliology is called hermeneutics, the science of\\n    how to interpret Scripture. The most basic rule of hermeneutics is to\\n    compare Scripture with Scripture. This is the rite of passage that\\n    determines how the particular author of a passage meant his words to be\\n    understood.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    How did the author of Shem's list use those words? The answer lies in how\\n    other Scriptures use genealogical concepts. Eventually it becomes apparent\\n    that they were about relating fathers to sons and sons to fathers, not\\n    giving exhaustive and complete lists. In effect they were used as this book\\n    finds in these first 100 plus pages. Identity was the issue, not history.\\n    Ultimately, Adam's line comes to a specific person named Noah and Noah's\\n    line comes to a specific person named Abraham whose descendants God will\\n    use to form the nation Israel and send the Savior. While it may be\\n    embarrassing or humiliating, those holding the chronological view must\\n    teach their followings the true way to view Shem's list.\\n</p>\\n<h3>\\n    Records Illustrating the Decline in Human Longevity\\n</h3>\\n<p>\\n    The information we have covered is summarized below in outline form.

By the end of that time\\n    Moses observed that the normal full lifetime of man was 70 years. Joseph\\n    died at 110 early in the Egyptian sojourn. It seems that these 40 years of\\n    decline (110-70=40) occurred over about 400 years, from 1800 to 1400 BC.\\n    That amounts to a decline of approximately 2.8 years per generation, but it\\n    was a decline under the great stresses of slavery and the wilderness\\n    wandering.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Inescapable Conclusion</strong>\\n    : The data above shows that the lifespans in each period were shorter than\\n    those in the previous period. No one who accepts the inerrancy of Scripture\\n    would dispute this. Thus, beyond question Scripture itself reveals a\\n    continuing decline of lifespan from the time the Ark survivors left the Ark\\n    until the day of Moses nearly three millennia later. This steady decline is\\n    undeniable.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    But the biblical numbers also reveal a second halving of human longevity,\\n    the halving between Eber and Peleg. Scripture records a 225 year difference\\n    in the lifespans of Eber and Peleg. A difference of 25 or even 50 years\\n    might be acceptable but a halving, from 450 years for the first three\\n    generations after the Flood to 236 years for the next three generations\\n    after the Flood is a red flag. Something happened between Eber and Peleg.\\n    That happening was the author of the passage employing the common Hebrew\\n    solution to long lists, he used \\\"to father\\\" in the broad sense rather than\\n    the usual narrow sense of immediate relationship. While following his\\n    pattern of reporting when each father produced a son, that number refers to\\n    the unnamed son while \\\"to father\\\" is used in the broad sense of a distant\\n    descendant.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    So, it took the most severe act of nature in human history, the Flood, to\\n    cut man's longevity from 900 to 450 years. Nowhere do we read of a similar\\n    act of nature to cut man's lifespan in half a second time. Thus, this\\n    second line of argument strengthens the conclusion that this huge span of\\n    225 years was not over a single generation; rather, it was the sum of\\n    declines of many generations skipped between Eber and Peleg. Missing\\n    generations explains the second halving of human longevity.\\n</p>\\n<h3>\\n    Genesis 5 - Omissions in the Line of Adam\\n</h3>\\n<p>\\n    <sup>6</sup>\\n    When Seth had lived 105 years, he fathered Enosh. <sup>7</sup>Seth lived\\nafter he fathered Enosh 807 years and had other sons and daughters.    <sup>8</sup>Thus all the days of Seth were 912 years, and he died. Genesis\\n    5:6-8.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Genesis five records Adam's genealogy, ten names from Adam to Noah. While\\n    it is not the subject of this book, it is often discussed along with Shem's\\n    list, so we must add a word about it. If Shem's line in Genesis 11 is\\n    explicit, Adam's line here in Genesis 5 is more so. While Shem's line gives\\n    five details including the years before and after the birth of the son,\\n    Adam's list gives those details and totals the years of the father as well.\\n    Why that sixth detail? Merely to establish a pattern? More likely, because\\n    of the great ages involved, the writer felt that he needed to total the\\n    years to avoid any misunderstanding.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    As in Shem's line, each of the details in Adam's line is literal. Each\\n    named person was a real person. He actually lived all the years the passage\\n    says and he fathered a son. Some see in this list the abbreviation of many\\n    millennia. One is the well-known covenant scholar, Meredith Kline who\\n    taught that this Adam list represented more human history than the entire\\n    time since the Flood<a href=\\\"#_ftn2\\\" name=\\\"_ftnref2\\\" title=\\\"\\\">[2]</a>. He\\n    observed that the list contains ten names which raises the suspicion that\\n    it is tailored. But his reason for this vast amount of time is that he\\n    views history in terms of divine covenants and according to him Peter\\n    divides history into the world that was, which perished by water, and the\\n    world that now is, which will perish by fire, as stated in II Peter 3:5-7.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    One of his students, Michael Lawrence, showed this author the printed notes\\n    from Dr. Kline's class on covenant theology at Gordon-Conwell Theological\\n    Seminary. Lawrence had previously earned a bachelor degree at Duke\\n    University and following Gordon, continued his education with a Ph.D. in\\n    church history at Cambridge University, often regarded as one of the most\\n    prestigious universities in the world. While he did not agree with Kline's\\n    idea of so many years before the Flood, he did give insight into why\\n    Archbishop James Ussher felt the lines of Adam and Shem were tight,\\n    exhaustive, immediate father-son relationships.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Lawrence explained that Ussher was a Bible scholar who loved the Word of\\n    God and believed in inerrancy. But he was bound by the rigid thinking\\n    concerning genealogies in Great Britain which viewed them as precise, exact\\n    and complete. England and Scotland had a combined monarchy. When Queen\\n    Elizabeth died childless a careful examination of genealogies determined\\n    that James VI of Scotland was the correct successor and he became King\\n    James I of England-Scotland. This selection required careful records for\\n    officials to determine who had the next claim to the throne. Precise\\n    genealogical records gave the answer. To Ussher it was inconceivable that\\n    genealogies could be taken in any other way.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    This was the only way someone living in England-Scotland would ever take\\n    genealogies. Ussher was a product of his culture and brought to the\\n    Scripture his cultural experience just as all Christians bring to the\\n    Scripture a framework of assumptions. In this way he made unfounded\\n    assumptions about the Biblical genealogies. To him genealogies were all\\nabout a line of succession.    <a href=\\\"#_ftn3\\\" name=\\\"_ftnref3\\\" title=\\\"\\\">[3]</a>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    While condensation is all but demanded by the enormous drop in longevity\\n    between Eber and Peleg, no such clue is found in the Adam line. Instead, we\\n    find a growing pattern of sin. \\\"The wickedness of man was great in the\\n    earth and...every intention of the thoughts of his heart was only evil\\n    continually\\\" (Genesis 6:5). Conversely, Enoch walked with the LORD and\\n    became the first of four successive, unbroken generations-Enoch,\\n    Methuselah, Lamech and Noah-so it was exactly 969 years from the birth of\\n    his son Methuselah to the Flood. Further, Seth was the immediate son of\\n    Adam. Only four fathers remain who might have represented thousands of\\n    omitted years-Enosh, Kenan, Mahalalel and Jared.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Man's growing sinfulness brought on the Flood. We suggest God's justice\\n    required Him to terminate generations born into this irreversible\\n    situation. To stop this pattern God limited the number of generations\\n    before the Flood. Kline failed to grasp the purpose of the Flood-to break\\n    the enslaving straight jacket of sin and restart the human race. While\\n    Adam's line does not represent millennia of human history, a few names\\n    might have been omitted to produce precisely ten. Even if two or three were\\n    omitted, this would add only 200-300 years to the age of the earth. Kline's\\n    call for a long pre-flood era of many millennia is merely another example\\n    of how we all wonder much about the years before the Flood. We take our\\n    various stabs at them. Yet, they lie not in numbers as much as in\\n    understanding the mysteries of iniquity and godliness (II Thessalonians 2\\n    and I Corinthians 15: 51-58.) Nevertheless, genealogies are a joy, when\\n    correctly understood, to keep us true to inerrancy and prevent presumption\\n    in our interpretations of Scripture.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    One minor discrepancy in our point that all eight who lived and died before\\n    the Flood lived about 900 years is Lamech who died at the age of 777. The\\n    next greatest deviation from the 900 year average is Methuselah who lived\\n    to 969. Methuselah died the year of the Flood, but his son (Lamech) died\\n    five years before the Flood. Very possibly Lamech was the victim of foul\\n    play as attempts grew to silence Noah and his message of judgment. Yet even\\nthis foul play served the purposes of God for it fell on the 777    <sup>th</sup> year of Lamech's life which in numerology has extreme\\n    significance. Seven represents completion and triple sevens would reflect\\n    the trinity in seeing this total rejection of the Creator. In Book 2 of\\n    creation geologist John Reed's fictional Flood trilogy the Godly who had\\n    helped build the Ark intended to board the Ark but the enemy murdered their\\n    entire community.<a href=\\\"#_ftn4\\\" name=\\\"_ftnref4\\\" title=\\\"\\\">[4]</a> Only the\\n    eight escaped.\\n</p>\\n<h4>\\n    What Abbreviated Genealogies Teach\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\n    To summarize, a faulty view of biblical genealogies leads to the idea that\\n    the time of the Flood and the creation of man can be calculated within a\\n    few years. This chapter has explained why Hebrew genealogies do not support\\n    such calculations. It finds overwhelming support that as many as 1300-1900\\n    years elapsed between Eber and Peleg and maybe 200-300 additional years\\n    before the Flood. This means that whereas many creationists thought that\\n    man and living things were created about 6000 years ago, they really were\\n    created more like 8000 years ago. Thus, we have good reason to be tentative\\n    where God is silent. But whether 6000 or 8000 or even 10,000 years old,\\n    lifeforms on planet earth are still vastly young compared to the billion\\n    year figure of secular science.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    So, this book joins those who find overwhelming biblical and scientific\\n    support for life on earth being but thousands of years old. However, we\\n    take exception with those who insist that Genesis chapter eleven presents a\\n    complete father-son list allowing a more exact age calculation. Just one\\n    clear exception in the Old Testament genealogies would question the idea of\\n    the Shem genealogy being complete. This paper presented such an exception\\n    in chapter one, the Levi-Aaron list. Chapter six provided many lists where\\n    abbreviation is established or suspected. We must conclude that it was not\\n    God's will for man to be burdened with establishing and defending the age\\n    of the earth to within a few years. Such an approach is not helpful. It\\n    produces divisions within and justified criticism without, all of which\\n    harm the Kingdom of God.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The next chapter tackles maybe the greatest disinformation to Shem's\\n    genealogy, that found in the Septuagint.\\n</p>\\n<strong>\\n    <br clear=\\\"all\\\"/>\\n</strong>\\n<div>\\n    <br clear=\\\"all\\\"/>\\n    <hr align=\\\"left\\\" size=\\\"1\\\" width=\\\"33%\\\"/>\\n    <div id=\\\"ftn1\\\">\\n        <p>\\n            <a href=\\\"#_ftnref1\\\" name=\\\"_ftn1\\\" title=\\\"\\\">\\n                <sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup>\\n            </a>\\n            Bill Cooper, <em>After the Flood</em> (Chichester, England: New\\n            Wine Press, 1995), 122.\\n        </p>\\n    </div>\\n    <div id=\\\"ftn2\\\">\\n        <p>\\n            <a href=\\\"#_ftnref2\\\" name=\\\"_ftn2\\\" title=\\\"\\\">\\n                <sup><sup>[2]</sup></sup>\\n            </a>\\n            Meredith Klein, \\\"Kingdom Prologue: Genesis Foundations for a\\n            Covenantal Worldview,\\\" (Hamilton, MA.: Gordon-Conwell Seminary\\n            classroom notes, 1992), 8.\\n        </p>\\n    </div>\\n    <div id=\\\"ftn3\\\">\\n        <p>\\n            <a href=\\\"#_ftnref3\\\" name=\\\"_ftn3\\\" title=\\\"\\\">\\n                <sup><sup>[3]</sup></sup>\\n            </a>\\n            Michael Lawrence, Senior Pastor, Hinson Baptist Church, Portland,\\n            OR, Interview by the author, 5/19/2015.\\n        </p>\\n    </div>\\n    <div id=\\\"ftn4\\\">\\n        <p>\\n            <a href=\\\"#_ftnref4\\\" name=\\\"_ftn4\\\" title=\\\"\\\">[4]</a>\\n            John K.

The omission of those generations places the Flood around\\n    4000 BC or nearly 1700 years earlier than Archbishop James Ussher\\'s Flood\\n    date. This finding is based on how Scripture itself uses family terms,\\n    genealogies and those numbers given in Genesis five and eleven. A daunting\\n    obstacle opposes this view-many Bibles do not contain the same numbers.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    You read correctly. Those numbers in Shem\\'s list as well as the numbers in\\n    Adam\\'s list, used by so many young earth creationists to determine the date\\n    of Noah\\'s Flood and creation, are not even found in a majority of the\\n    world\\'s Bibles. They appear in most Protestant Bibles. But Catholic and\\n    Orthodox Bibles contain numbers from the Septuagint, a Greek translation of\\n    the Hebrew Old Testament and the adherents of those branches of Christendom\\n    greatly exceed those who use the Protestant Bible-1.6 billion vs 920\\n    million according to Wikipedia. The begetting year of most fathers in those\\n    Bibles is increased by 100. Even some knowledgeable creationists argue\\n    adamantly for the Septuagint\\'s larger numbers. If we are using wrong\\n    numbers, this book cannot be right.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    To make matters worse, the Flood itself is viewed as a local event by a\\n    significant number of godly Bible believing Christians and the six days of\\n    creation as undefined periods of time. Other views also conflict with our\\n    missing 35-55 generations view. While entire books address the many issues\\n    examined in this chapter, we will explain the view and give the fewest\\n    possible words in answering it. But be warned, this is a venture into\\n    uncharted territory for most inerrancy folks.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Up front we want to dogmatically state that we believe the Bible of the\\n    Reformation preserves the correct text. While the Greek<em> Septuagint</em>\\n    (<em>LXX</em>) is an excellent translation of its base Hebrew text, the Old\\n    Testament was originally written in Hebrew. To some extent a translation\\n    contains interpretations of the translator, so the text of the original\\n    language must be preferred. This was the conviction of the Protestant\\n    reformers who fought numerous misinterpretations based on the LXX. This is\\n    why seminaries that train pastors teach the original languages of both the\\n    Old and New Testaments. Besides being a translation, the LXX contains 14\\n    non-canonical books, obvious changes from the original and contrived\\n    numbers in the genealogies of Adam and Shem. For these reasons and more, we\\nview the original language text called the <em>Masoretic Text</em> (    <em>MT</em>) to be the correct Old Testament text.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Origin of the Greek Septuagint (LXX)</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Our story begins by rehearsing how there came to be two major versions of\\n    the Old Testament. In colorful language Flavius Josephus relates that\\n    Ptolemy II Philadelphus who ruled Egypt from 285 to 246 BC requested of the\\n    high priest in Jerusalem that a copy of the Torah be translated into Greek\\n    and added to his library in Alexandria which had reached 200,000-volumes by\\n    that point. Over time Ptolemy\\'s library became one of the most famous in\\n    the ancient world and it\\'s Greek became the common language of the\\n    Mediterranean region and Middle East. The Torah contains the first five\\n    books of the OT written by Moses as God spoke to Israel in the wilderness\\n    (1446-1406 BC). Ptolemy\\'s request was nearly 1200 years later, about 250\\n    BC. Jerusalem sent 72 elders to Alexandria where they quickly made the\\n    translation. Because just over 70 Jews were involved, their translation was\\n    called the<em> Septuagint</em>, the Greek word for 70.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    A second story dates the LXX to about 280 BC. While only 30 years separate\\n    the two dates, the Word of God requires accuracy and truth. Evidence favors\\n    the 250 date but the 280 date is advanced by those who argue for the LXX\\n    numbers and therefore is important to the question of which text contains\\n    the correct numbers. This controversy is explored in much detail in\\n    Appendix 8.3.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The original Septuagint contained just the five books of Moses-Genesis,\\n    Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy. This is extremely important\\n    because over hundreds of years many more books were added to it, yet the\\n    growing collection continued to be called the \"<em>Septuagint</em>.\" First,\\n    by fits and starts during the next 150 years the remainder of the Hebrew\\n    Bible was translated into the Greek by possibly four generations of\\n    translators and became a part of the Septuagint. This was the OT often\\n    cited in the NT. Then, as the church age progressed more and more\\n    non-canonical books were added to it. This much larger collection is what\\n    the words \"<em>Septuagint</em>\" and \"<em>LXX</em>\" refer to today.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Aramaic Replaces Hebrew</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    An impressive argument for the LXX numbers is that they are supported by\\n    400 years of historians including Demetrius, Eupolemus, Philo and Josephus\\n    before the first known mention of the MT numbers. This MT silent period\\n    lasted from the beginning of the LXX translation to the alleged Jewish\\n    deflation of the birthing numbers after 70 AD. However, it happened as\\n    Hebrew underwent a transformation in Israel. With the destruction of Israel\\n    and the Babylonian Captivity, nearby peoples replaced the Jewish\\n    population. As Jews slowly returned after the prophesied 70 years of exile,\\n    they became mixed with this new population, some of whom spoke a\\n    significant regional Semitic language called Aramaic (from Aram, one of\\n    Shem\\'s five sons). As Aramaic words entered the Jews\\' Hebrew language,\\n    their distinctive Hebrew tongue eventually came to be replaced by Aramaic.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    By Jesus\\' day Aramaic, not Hebrew, was the everyday language spoken in\\n    Israel. Possibly only several hundred thousand Jews could even understand\\n    biblical Hebrew. To get along as a conquered people, many Jews in Israel\\n    also spoke the international language, the Koine Greek. Scholars debate\\n    just how much the average Jew of that day used or even understood Biblical\\n    Hebrew although the Hebrew OT did continue to be used by Jews in Temple\\n    functions, scholarly debates, public teaching and readings in local\\n    synagogues. Nevertheless, that Hebrew OT was the official OT text of\\nJudaism and in coming centuries came to be known as the    <em>Masoretic Text</em> (<em>MT</em>).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Just before His ascension Jesus told his disciples \"You will be my\\n    witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the\\n    earth\" (Acts 1:8). As the church reached further and further from\\n    Jerusalem, it needed to speak in a language the world understood. That\\n    language was not Aramaic or biblical Hebrew. It was the Koine Greek. The\\nearly disciples witnessed from the Greek Old Testament, the LXX. Thus, the    <em>LXX</em> became the commonly used OT Bible of the NT Church while the\\n    books of the NT all came to be preserved if not written in that same Greek\\n    language and remain so to this day. Fifteen hundred years later leaders of\\n    the Protestant Reformation returned to the Hebrew MT believing it was the\\n    true OT.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Necessity, therefore, forced the use of the Greek LXX, but the Dead Sea\\n    Scrolls (DSS) prove beyond doubt that the MT all along was the preferred\\n    Jewish text. The next pages will explain why their existence is among the\\n    top reasons <em>Hidden Beauty</em> believes the MT, not the LXX contains\\n    the true birthing numbers in the Genesis five and eleven genealogies.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Continuing, we also learn from this so-called period of silence the\\n    priority of God. He was vastly more concerned with getting out the Gospel\\n    than establishing the dates for the Flood and creation. In fact, those\\n    dates were so unimportant to God that they are never given in all of\\n    Scripture. Suggesting that a written summation of the Genesis five and\\n    eleven numbers is unnecessary and the reader can add those two sets of\\n    birthing ages in his head while reading the text defies about every rule of\\n    writing. This is doubly certain in view of the summation of each birthing\\n    and remaining number in the Genesis five list. Nine times Scripture gives\\n    the birthing number, the remaining years and sums those two numbers.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Clearly, by summing those two numbers nine times, the author shows they\\n    were meant to be summed while the absence of a summation of the nineteen\\n    birthing numbers shows they were not meant to be summed. Such minor issues\\n    as the dates of the Flood and creation could wait until they needed to be\\n    addressed. But Jesus commanded the apostles to devote their attention to\\n    announcing the good news that \"God so loved the world that he gave his only\\n    son, that whoever believes on him should not perish but have eternal life\"\\n    (John 3:16).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    In addition to the two major Pentateuchal texts-the Masoretic Text in\\n    Hebrew and the original Septuagint in Koine Greek-the Samaritans had their\\n    own version. When they separated from Judah following Solomon\\'s reign, the\\n    godly among them honored Moses and lived by the Pentateuch. Nevertheless,\\n    the ungodly leaders made major changes such as changing certain commands\\n    related to worshipping in Jerusalem so that they could live as a separate\\n    kingdom. It was written in Hebrew using the Samaritan alphabet. It is\\n    called the <em>Samaritan Pentateuch</em> (<em>SP</em>) and is helpful to\\n    textual scholars as they study verses in the Books of Moses. However, after\\n    the captivity it lost its significance and by the days of Jesus and the\\n    Apostles, the <em>MT</em> and <em>LXX</em> were the primary OTs used.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Differences between the MT and the LXX</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    There are tens of thousands of differences between the MT and the canonical\\n    OT LXX books. Many are merely matters of breathing, pronunciation,\\n    spelling, etc. The <em>Torah</em> is the most similar in the two versions\\n    while substantial differences are found in some of the other books such as\\n    Jeremiah and Daniel. Our concern is the numbers in Shem\\'s genealogy which\\n    most creationists sum to calculate the date of the Flood. If those numbers\\n    are wrong, we are beating a dead horse and Ussher\\'s date for the Flood is\\n    wrong as well.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Astonishingly all but the key numbers differ in the Genesis five and eleven\\nlists as authority Dr. Pete Williams wrote in a 1998    <em>Journal of Creation</em> article. Further, the LXX contains one more\\n    name than the MT. In a spreadsheet Williams displayed side by side the\\nyears given in the three OT Pentateuch texts for Genesis five and eleven.    <a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\" title=\"\">[1]</a> This involves a whopping\\n    146 numbers. (See Appendix, Tables 8.1 and 8.2.) In fact, of 20 names only\\n    the numbers of Noah and Shem agree in all three texts. Beyond mere\\n    disagreements of certain numbers, twelve fathers were 100 years older when\\n    their heir was born according to the LXX. The LXX numbers also provides a\\n    gradual decline of human longevity.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Many creationists prefer the larger numbers and several dogmatically defend\\n    them. They charge that the birthing ages in the two genealogies were\\n    deliberately and systematically deflated after 70 AD in the MT while the\\n    LXX numbers are mostly the correct numbers. They add that they are not\\n    alone, that others who believe in the inerrancy of Scripture also maintain\\n    that the MT numbers were deflated. On the other hand, Williams says that\\n    both \"the Septuagint and the Samaritan Pentateuch show evidence of\\n    systematic schematisation [British] within themselves.\" Is Williams a lone\\n    voice? No. Numbers specialists have studied and compared the three\\n    different manuscripts of these two passages. In noting the specific numbers\\n    and their patterns they conclude that the <em>LXX</em> numbers are\\n    artificial and obviously manipulated-devised, not natural.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Why would specialists in the field of number patterns stamp the LXX numbers\\n    as artificial and manipulated? Here are three reasons and undoubtedly there\\n    are more. First, the birthing numbers in the LXX are uncannily similar to\\n    each other. From Cainan to Lamach they read 170, 165, 162, 165 and 167. The\\n    odds of five consecutive generations giving birth to their heirs so close\\n    to the same age is great. Because the MT numbers are 100 years less, they\\n    are spread out about four times compared with the LXX and do not raise red\\n    flags to numbers specialists. The Shem list, though, is a scandal. The LXX\\n    gives the following birthing ages for the first seven (including the extra\\n    name in the LXX list) named fathers born in his line after the Flood: 135,\\n    130, 130, 134, 130, 132, 130. The odds of such similar birthing ages are\\n    astronomical. Second, the LXX numbers show a consistent decline in\\n    longevity after the Flood with one exception. While this is extremely\\n    satisfying to the secular mind, it is a stretch statistically.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Thirdly, the LXX Shem birthing numbers show an artificial pattern when\\n    calculated as a percentage of total lifespan. This observation is not\\n    apparent on the surface, but stands out when one divides the birthing age\\n    by the total age. For example, Arpachshad was 135 when he fathered the next\\n    generation. Divide 135 by his lifespan of 438. The answer, 23.9%, tells how\\n    far he was into his total years when he fathered the next generation. The\\n    first four names (Arpachshad, Cainan, Shelah and Eber) show these\\n    percentages: <a name=\"_Hlk85366964\">23.9%, 28.3%, 28.3% and 26.6% </a>and\\n    this in spite of LXX adjustments in total ages to show gradual reduction in\\n    longevity. The next four names show these percentages: 38.3%, 38.9%, 39.4%\\n    and 38.0% in spite of an increase in Nahor\\'s longevity. The artificial\\n    nature of these numbers is obvious-four consecutive names with percentages\\n    between 23.9% and 28.3% and the very next four names with percentages\\n    between 38.0% and 39.4%.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    If using today\\'s average lifespan of 70 years, these numbers would read\\n    16.7%, 19.8%, 19.8% and 18.6% for the first four names and 26.8%, 27.3%,\\n    27.6% and 23.9% for the second four names. By comparison the MT percentages\\n    are 8.0%, 6.9% and 7.3% for the three names and 12.6%, 13.4% and 13.0% for\\n    the next three. This is consistent with the contention of this book that\\n    following the first three names is a gap of 35-55 generations. The MT\\n    birthing numbers show that the first generations after the Flood obeyed\\n    God\\'s command to \"be fruitful and multiply\" (Genesis 9:7) by having\\n    children as soon as they were physically capable while the LXX numbers\\n    don\\'t show such urgency (23.9%, 28.3%, 28.3% and 26.6%). The very numbers\\n    of the LXX are sufficient reason to reject them.\\n</p>\\n<p align=\"center\">\\n    <strong>The Dead Sea Scrolls</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    But the very best evidence, however, to uphold the MT as the correct OT\\n    text is the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls (DSS). Those who weigh the MT\\n    vs the LXX must understand these scrolls so <em>Hidden Beauty</em> devotes\\n    many pages to their content, the Qumran community and distortions by\\n    sensationalists. See Appendix 8.4 - 8.6. In 1947 Bedouin youths looking for\\n    lost sheep stumbled across several parchments in a cave near the Dead Sea.\\n    They were identified as legitimate ancient documents and soon the search\\n    was on for more. Over eight years searchers found 900 scrolls and uncounted\\n    fragments, mostly in Hebrew and written on parchment. They were hidden in\\n    eleven caves in the cliffs close to an ancient two-building settlement\\n    called Qumran that looked down on the NW corner of the Dead Sea. The\\n    fragile pieces of parchment had been preserved by the hot, dry desert\\n    climate and the darkness of the caves. This discovery is variously called\\n    the greatest archaeological event of the 20<sup>th</sup> century and the\\n    greatest finding of ancient documents of all time.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Searchers found fragments of every book of the OT except Esther. Textual\\n    scholars began studying the manuscripts as soon as they realized the\\n    scrolls were genuine and have been studying them ever since. A growing list\\n    of insights have developed over the intervening 70 years of study and the\\n    more recent discovery of scrolls at six other Judean Desert locations.\\n    Seven hundred of the original scrolls are non-biblical sacred writings.\\n    They give a new understanding of the religious life of Israel during this\\n    period. But <em>HB</em> is exploring the question of whether the LXX or MT\\n    is the true OT so it will focus on the 200 plus biblical scrolls as well as\\n    more recent biblical discoveries. First, early impressions will be\\n    reported. Then the more accurate current understanding is related.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The scholars quickly realized that not all the texts read alike. Yes, many\\n    of them did read like the earliest already-existing MTs, but some of them\\n    read like the earliest LXX texts. Further, some did not read like either.\\n    They were sorted into piles that were similar. Eventually they had five\\n    groups-those similar to the MT, those similar to the LXX, those similar to\\n    the Samaritan Pentateuch, a fourth similar group and finally those that fit\\n    none of the four piles. What an eye-opener. Before, the thinking was that\\n    there was just a single text of the Hebrew Old Testament and copies of it\\n    had more or fewer mistakes depending on the diligence of the scribe. Now it\\n    was apparent that multiple Hebrew OT texts had come into existence over the\\n    centuries.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    In studying the base Hebrew texts used to translate the LXX, the scholars\\n    discovered that the LXX was a good translation, that it faithfully\\n    translated the Hebrew text that it was based on. As a result, the LXX has\\n    been declared an excellent and trustworthy translation of its source Hebrew\\n    texts. Some of the remarkable evidence for its accuracy will be addressed\\n    later.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The presence of different families of OT texts at Qumran means the 70 who\\n    translated the Hebrew Bible into Greek had multiple Hebrew texts to choose\\n    from. They did not have to change any birthing numbers in the genealogies\\n    of Adam and Shem. Those numbers already existed in the text they selected\\n    to translate into Greek. The argument that the LXX numbers are right while\\n    the MT numbers have been changed doesn\\'t fit the finding of multiple Hebrew\\n    OT text families found at Qumran.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The existence of these multiple textual families led to further\\n    observations. Differences in the texts did not seem to trouble the\\n    Qumranian scribes. They carefully copied the texts they procured, even\\n    obvious mistakes. This showed the care with which the scribes did their\\n    copying. The two previous oldest Masoretic Texts were the Aleppo Codex of\\n    930 AD and the Leningrad Codex of 1050 AD. They are almost identical to\\n    each other. Now the DSS discovery brought to light scrolls that existed a\\n    thousand years before and they were remarkably similar to those two\\n    medieval texts. One scroll is the complete book of Isaiah. It is amazingly\\n    close to Isaiah in the previous oldest copy of the MT, the Aleppo Codex.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    However, the birthing years in Genesis five and eleven is the issue before\\n    us. With several exceptions the scrolls are not complete OT books but\\n    rather portions of OT books, chapters and even compilations of verses from\\n    various books. None contain any of the birthing years of Genesis five and\\n    eleven so that is not our argument. Rather, they consistently show that the\\n    Scriptures regardless of textual family were carefully and faithfully\\n    copied during the time when Israel was shifting from Hebrew to Aramaic.\\n    Thus, the DSS prove that the charge that Jews made extensive changes to the\\n    MT in the second century A.D. is false.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The birthing numbers were changed sometime before the translation into\\n    Greek. So, when the Jews translated their Torah for Ptolemy\\'s library, they\\n    had multiple texts to choose from and to avoid offending the Egyptians\\n    chose a text that had the larger numbers. Toward the end of this chapter,\\n    we will describe the development of the OT canon and suggest those birthing\\n    numbers were most likely changed well before 250 BC.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>More Recent Insights</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    In 2016 newly developed computer imaging was able to read a charred Hebrew\\n    scroll from an ancient synagogue at Engedi dated c. 200 AD. The scroll\\n    consisted of Leviticus chapters one and two. The words in it were identical\\n    to the earliest existing Hebrew copy of Leviticus 1-2. Emanuel Tov, who\\n    coordinated the work of 98 scholars during his years as editor-in-chief of\\n    the 40 volume DSS publishing project from 1991 to 2009, exclaimed, \"We have\\n    never found something as striking as this. This is the earliest evidence of\\n    the exact form of the medieval text [earliest previously existing MTs, the\\nAleppo and Leningrad Codices].\"    <a href=\"#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\" title=\"\">[2]</a> Biblical scrolls found at\\n    five other Judean Desert locations are like the Engedi Leviticus scroll.\\n    They are identical (or nearly identical) to the MT. They were carried by\\n    those fleeing the Romans during the Jewish revolts of 67 and 132 AD and\\n    represent Jewish national circles that adhered only to the MT.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    More careful examination of the Qumran scrolls since 1990 reveals that the\\n    Pentateuchal ones were likewise close to the MT while the texts of other OT\\n    books were more like other textual families. In a 17-page article Emanuel\\nTov, explains what was going on.    <a href=\"#_ftn3\" name=\"_ftnref3\" title=\"\">[3]</a> The goal of the Qumran\\n    community was to keep the Mosaic Law as perfectly as humanly possible. In\\n    this effort they interpreted the requirements of the law more strictly than\\n    the priesthood in Jerusalem and viewed themselves as the true Israel. They\\n    were opposing the wicked priest (presumably the Levitical officials at\\n    Jerusalem) and even observed a different calendar than the temple\\n    leadership. They wrote the 700 non-biblical sacred texts in their efforts\\n    to accomplish their goal. So while they stayed close to the Pentateuchal MT\\n    in their effort to fully keep the law, they practiced greater freedom in\\n    the other OT books, showing their freedom from the religious establishment\\n    in Jerusalem.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Those loyal to the Jerusalem priesthood fled the Roman war machine but did\\n    not take their scrolls to Qumran. Instead, they hid out in other Judean\\n    Desert locations. The Qumran scrolls represent various religious movements\\n    in Israel that identified with the Qumran goal. As a result, on the one\\n    hand scrolls exist that are identical or nearly identical to the MT\\n    Pentateuch which shows the great care given the MT. On the other hand, the\\n    existence of multiple textual families shows beyond question that these\\n    different textual families were well known in Israel and had a long\\n    history.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Tov also wrote an article on the numbers problem in the three major\\n    Pentateuchs. He concluded that the differences are recensional, not\\n    scribal.<a href=\"#_ftn4\" name=\"_ftnref4\" title=\"\">[4]</a> He believes that\\n    the Hebrew base text for the LXX and Samaritan Pentateuch developed as one\\n    text and were later separated. He also views the LXX numbers as obviously\\n    contrived.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Now, for another shocker. The textual scholars have studied OT quotes in\\n    the New Testament. It turns out the NT authors cited verses from various OT\\n    textual families. Tov observed that the Apostle Paul used currently\\n    recognized different Greek textual families for the same biblical book\\n    (Isaiah) and apparently under the same conditions in the same epistle\\n    (Romans). Paul, it appears, used whatever text was available wherever he\\n    happened to be. This shows that God\\'s focus is the message, not the exact\\n    wording.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    To all the DSS evidence for the careful handling of Scripture, two\\n    unfortunate responses are found. Most creationists dismiss them. In fact,\\n    most have not even heard much about them. But those who have say the people\\n    who lived in the tiny settlement of Qumran in the midst of the 11 Dead Sea\\n    caves and collected and copied the scrolls are insignificant, unimportant.\\n    Unbelievers go even further, identifying them as heretics-Essenes. The\\n    Essenes had their own agenda. They mixed Judaism with heathen beliefs from\\n    ancient Eastern religions. They conclude that possibly Jesus got His ideas\\n    from them. In contrast, creationists conclude: they were not a part of true\\n    Israel; their scrolls prove nothing about God; mystery and confusion\\n    surround them; we have better things to do with our time.\\n</p>\\n<p align=\"center\">\\n    <strong>Reasons to Prefer the Masoretic Text Numbers</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    A plethora of misinformation underlies the thinking of those who prefer the\\n    LXX numbers. Our first eight reasons for rejecting these arguments have\\n    already been explained. First and foremost is that the DSS argue for a\\n    strong preference for the MT. Second, the LXX translators had multiple\\n    Hebrew texts to choose from and chose the textual family with the larger\\n    numbers. Third, the LXX numbers are obviously manipulated. Fourth, the\\n    changing of languages in Israel and growing dependance on the LXX explains\\n    why the LXX birthing numbers predominantly show up in historical records.\\n    Fifth, God\\'s clear priority was to get out the Gospel, not clarify minor\\n    issues such as the dates of the Flood and creation.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Sixth, the purpose of the numbers: most creationists say they were given to\\n    establish a chronology of early earth history. This argument was addressed\\n    at length in chapter one (pp 17-19). It quotes a conservative Hebrew\\n    scholar who offered possible non-chronology purposes for those numbers. He\\n    specifically stated that \"The major arguments they use (for the\\n    chrono-genealogical view) are defective and falsifiable.\" Arguments seven\\n    and eight are major subjects of this book-the common Hebrew practice of\\n    condensing genealogies and the huge decline of longevity between Eber and\\n    Peleg in the MT. (These two arguments dissolve if the LXX numbers are\\n    correct. The LXX numbers contain no enormous decline in longevity between\\n    two generations which strongly suggests the omitting of generations.)\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The remaining arguments have not been previously mentioned. Nine. This\\n    argument involves a complicated grammatical issue regarding the form of the\\n    Hebrew verb \"beget\" in the Genesis five and eleven lists. Hebrew verbs do\\n    not have tenses. While English verbs have tenses which tell about the\\n    \"when\" of the action, Hebrew verbs have seven possible stems which tell the\\n    type of action of the verb. One of the challenges to the new Hebrew student\\n    is learning all the forms of those stems for the same verb.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The Hebrew verb for beget (YALAD) is in the hiphil stem in Genesis five and\\n    eleven. It is used consistently for a total of 55 times. Those not seasoned\\n    in Hebrew might translate the hiphil of YALAD with \"he had\" or \"he brought\\n    forth to birth.\" With this rendering of YALAD the student might conclude\\n    that because of this, the age of the father when the named son was born\\n    establishes a chronology. He might conclude that though names may be\\n    omitted, the chronology remains unchanged. With this thinking he would sum\\n    the Shem list birthing ages found in the LXX and confidently conclude that\\n    the Flood occurred around 3300 BC. By adding the numbers in Adam\\'s list, he\\n    would place creation around 5560 BC. Thus, the Hebrew student would\\n    conclude that the Hebrew grammatical structure prohibits omitting\\n    generations.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The fact is that the hiphil stem indicates <strong>causative</strong>\\n    action. While the basic qal stem would be sufficient for \"he had\" or \"he\\n    brought forth to birth,\" the hiphil stem has greater force. It says \"A\"\\n    took an action that <strong>caused</strong> the birth of generation B. If a\\n    generation \"C\" followed, \"A\\'s\" action, in effect, caused that birth as\\n    well. In fact, regardless of how many generations followed \"B,\" \"A\\'s\"\\n    action caused that chain. All descendants of \"A\" were caused by that action\\n    (even though the actions of descendants were necessary as well). But the\\n    writer felt the need to record when \"A\" took that action. This is where the\\n    confusion arises. The offspring\\'s name is mistakenly linked to the age.\\n    When that happens, the reader establishes a chronology. But \"A\\'s\" age was\\n    when he took this action and his immediate son was born, not always when\\n    the person the author wanted to feature was born. The named son could be\\n    the immediate son or he could be any descendant down the line. It was the\\n    choice of the author to name the one in the line he wanted to feature.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    If the author had wished to emphasize that the son was born in the normal\\n    process of nature, the stem indicating <strong>intensive</strong> action,\\n    the piel stem, would have been used. That would be saying that \"A\" did not\\n    adopt \"B\" or buy him as a slave or procure him in some other way, but he\\n    acquired him by <strong>begetting</strong> him. But neither the qal nor\\npiel stems were selected. The author chose the stem that emphasizes    <strong>causation</strong> and he did this repeatedly. So, the passage\\n    emphasizes that the father\\'s action caused the births of all who resulted\\n    from his action. If the author named \"C\" rather than \"B,\" he would be\\n    skipping one generation. If he named \"G\" rather than \"B,\" he would be\\n    skipping B, C, D, E and F-five generations. Thus, the hiphil does not\\n    introduce a chronology. Because of the hiphil those from Green to Unger who\\n    taught Hebrew for a lifetime knew they are on solid ground when they state\\n    that names were omitted in the lists.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Believers who subscribe to the inerrancy of Scripture are to be commended\\n    as they try to take the literal meaning of the words their translations\\n    use. But since the Hebrew verb form can, to some extent, be lost in the\\n    translation, Scripture must be read with care. To this extent those who\\n    read a translation of the Hebrew are dependent on Hebrew scholars. Why four\\n    paragraphs on the hiphil not supporting the chronological argument? It is\\n    because creationists have been inundated with articles on Genesis five and\\n    eleven being chronologies. Those lists are even given a special\\n    name-chronogenealogies. In effect, those well read in creationist\\n    literature have been brainwashed as this idea has been repeated over and\\n    over so it could take multiple explanations using different words to plant\\n    the correct meaning in their minds.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Ten. The DSS are first hand documents in existence today. Conversely, the\\n    actual texts of many of the various external witnesses to the LXX numbers\\n    during the 400 silent years such as Demetrius, Eupolemus and Philo are not\\n    available for independent verification. They cannot be checked to determine\\n    if their statements are consistent, in proper context and not somehow\\n    compromised. Rules of evidence prefer a physical document to a report of a\\n    document.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Eleven. Josephus is cited as a key historical witness to the LXX birthing\\n    numbers but his testimony is questionable. He declared that everything he\\n    wrote came straight from the Jews sacred books and that he accessed the\\n    original Hebrew documents. Yet he was in Rome and under Flavian patronage\\n    when he wrote all of his known works. Josephus scholars universally decry\\n    his liberties with the facts. He elaborated at will and changed obvious\\n    facts to entertain and not offend his readers. For instance, in relating\\n    about Abraham in Genesis 11 and 20, he says Abraham and Nahor married their\\n    cousins, the daughters of their brother Haran. When Abimelech confronted\\n    Abraham about Sarah being his wife, Josephus wrote that Abraham said she\\n    was his cousin even though the LXX says \"Sarah is the daughter of my\\n    father, but not the daughter of my mother.\" Without question he would\\n    definitely have reported the greater LXX birthing numbers as the MT numbers\\n    would have insulted the intelligence of his readers.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Behind the personage was a character. Here are the facts. He was a Jewish\\n    general in Galilee leading a revolt against the Romans. He was defeated and\\n    taken prisoner. That should have been the end, but Josephus had a secret\\n    weapon, words. With words he made the Romans and Greeks love him. The way\\n    he wrote delighted them. He even wrote they all worshipped the same god.\\n    Various people used different names. The Greeks called him Zeus.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    In addition to Josephus\\' known penchant to elaborate at will, his LXX list\\n    does not include the second Cainan. He writes that from Adam to Moses were\\n    ten fathers and from Shem to Abraham were ten fathers so he leaves out the\\n    second Cainan. This is extremely damaging to his testimony. In fact, it\\n    pretty much disqualifies his witness to the LXX numbers. It indicates that\\n    he had no Hebrew text or if he did, it did not contain the second Cainan,\\n    or he wanted to delight his audience with exactly ten names in each list.\\n    Since the second Cainan is in today\\'s LXX, one must wonder just how\\n    reliable his copy of the LXX was or how reliable today\\'s copy is. He also\\n    gave three or four different numbers from today\\'s LXX. While Josephus is\\n    cited as a leading ancient historian to the LXX numbers, if a leading\\n    witness is so defective, how certain can we be about the others?\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Twelve. Jerome (345-420 AD) testified to seeing the actual Hebrew texts in\\n    Jerusalem. This man was a true scholar in Latin, Hebrew and Greek. He\\n    translated the Latin Vulgate directly from the Hebrew. Even though he is\\n    dated to the late 4<sup>th</sup> century AD, he would have carefully\\n    investigated any tales of Jewish officials deflating the numbers after 70\\n    AD and he would not have selected the MT numbers unless he was convinced\\n    they were correct. Jerome is a strong witness to the MT numbers.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Thirteen. Argument from the Book of Jubilees (BOJ). The BOJ (c. 150-160 BC)\\n    declares that 50 Jubilees occurring from Creation to Joshua\\'s conquests,\\n    2500 years. To do so it changed some MT birthing years in the two lists to\\n    total that number but its first five birthing numbers are the same as those\\n    in the MT and the sixth is different by just one year. LXX advocates say\\n    that the MT numbers were copied from the BOJ and since the BOJ numbers are\\n    unreliable, the MT numbers are also unreliable.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Scholars agree that the BOJ numbers were contrived to produce fifty\\n    jubilees. Still, God\\'s law regarding sabbath years lay deep in the souls of\\n    His people. They were to do no work and let the land rest on the seventh\\n    year. After observing seven sabbatical years they were to observe a super\\n    sabbatical year on the fiftieth year. So, the numbers seven, 49 and 50 were\\n    very powerful and pleasing to the Jewish mind. Is it not possible that some\\n    overzealous Jew began thinking about those begetting numbers in the MT and\\n    by changing some could more establish Israel\\'s early history from them with\\n    greater certainty? He could use the first numbers because they were small\\n    and would give his idea credibility. In fact, he would only have to change\\n    a half dozen of the 19 MT numbers to achieve his goal. This could explain\\n    how the BOJ came to be written.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    More importantly, the MT numbers existed well over a thousand years before\\n    the BOJ numbers. So, the argument using the BOJ as the source for the MT\\n    numbers is backwards. The BOJ got many of its numbers from the existing MT.\\n    Further, while the BOJ drew considerable attention at both Qumran and\\n    Jerusalem, it was never declared authoritative in either place.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    A baker\\'s dozen of arguments have been given preferring the MT birthing\\n    numbers in Genesis five and eleven. These arguments will be challenged by\\n    godly believers. Some of our thirteen arguments may even be incorrect. For\\n    instance, the Josephus argument may be blamed on scribal errors and the\\n    external witness argument may be challenged. But no one can dismiss most of\\n    the others such as the arguments from the DSS and the pattern of the LXX\\n    numbers. Consequently, the inescapable conclusion is that MT numbers are\\n    correct and the LXX numbers are artificial.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    However, some advance a fourteenth argument for the MT numbers. They claim\\n    that God promised to preserve the Scripture\\'s original text. They cite such\\n    verses as Psalm 12:7, Luke 16:17, Romans 12:1-2, and Jude 1:3 for this\\n    claim. This is so surprising that we must repeat: one highly visible Ph.D.\\n    creationist (and his followers) in effect says God has promised to preserve\\n    the original autographs. But this is not what those verses are saying.\\n    Rather, they concern the fulfillment of what God has promised, not the text\\n    in which He promised it. Jesus indicated clearly that God will fulfill all\\n    He has said in Matthew 5:18: \"Until heaven and earth pass away, not an\\n    iota, not a dot, will pass from the Law until all is accomplished.\"\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The idea that God has promised to preserve the original text sends the\\n    blood pressure of scholars who have spent lifetimes studying the various\\n    texts and therefore know of thousands of differences in them through the\\n    ceiling. It brings utter scorn on all who hold it. As we have said\\n    repeatedly, the original autographs were lost long ago. Errors have entered\\n    into the text(s) that we have today. Thus, we must compare Scripture with\\n    Scripture to get the clearest and best meaning. Creationists need to\\n    separate themselves from this unbiblical teaching.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Those who prefer the LXX birthing numbers do so because they are persuaded\\n    that the Flood and creation occurred earlier than Ussher\\'s dates and the\\nLXX accommodates them with earlier Flood and creation dates.    <em>Hidden Beauty</em> also came into existence because it seemed that\\ncivilization was going strong at the time of Ussher\\'s Flood date. But    <em>HB</em> limited its search to the Scriptures and drew its conclusions\\n    from the common and frequent practices within the Hebrew text. Defending\\n    the larger LXX numbers is certainly zeal for God, but wouldn\\'t it be better\\n    to stand on the common practices of Scripture which uses family terms\\n    broadly and condenses genealogies?\\n</p>\\n<p align=\"center\">\\n    <strong>Other Views Needing Fine Tuning </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>The Local Flood View</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Believers exposed to the early pronouncements from the budding science of\\n    geology saw their precious Bible vilified via Noah\\'s Flood. While the Flood\\n    is the greatest geological event spoken of since creation, it is a\\n    religious story and thus a tempting target for scoffers. And that is what\\n    happened. Early geologists unmercifully ridiculed the biblical Flood story.\\n    Those who love Jesus searched for an answer. They noticed that the words\\n    Scripture uses for the Flood are employed in different senses throughout\\n    the Bible and began to defend it by reasoning that Scripture was using\\n    words like \"all,\" \"every\" and \"on the earth\" in a limited sense. They\\n    suggested the Flood may have occurred where a sea like the Black Sea exists\\n    today or possibly the Flood wiped out a large population in a region like\\n    the Tigris-Euphrates River basin.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Geologists have learned much since the days of Charles Lyell, the father of\\n    geology. Now they know of entire systems or masses of magma that rise like\\n    plumes or trees all the way from the lower mantle to the surface of the\\n    earth. One is under the Indian Ocean. Another is under an area greater than\\n    Ethiopia. \"All the fountains of the great deep burst forth\" (Genesis 7:11)\\n    no longer sounds that far-fetched. Geologists know that the crust of the\\n    earth up to ten miles down is layered with fossil-bearing, water-deposited\\n    material and hardened flows of magma. These layers can be traced for\\n    thousands of miles and give evidence of immediate deposit. Vast amounts of\\n    physical evidence in the earth\\'s surface layers confirms a global flood.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    However, believers should look to Scripture as the final authority, not\\n    Scripture as interpreted by some human authority. Scripture itself uses an\\n    overwhelming number of terms commonly understood in a global, world-wide\\n    sense in speaking of the Flood:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    -Of the wickedness of man and judgment on all humans outside the ark:\\n    Genesis 6:3, 5, 5, 6, 7, 11, 11, 12, 12, 13, 13, 13, 17, 19, 19, 20, 20;\\n    7:4, 11, 11, 21, 22, 23 (23 times);\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    -Of the death of all land animals except those on the ark: Genesis 6:19,\\n    20; 7:3, 14, 14, 14, 15, 16, 21, 22, 23, 23, 23, 23 (14 times);\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    -Of the waters increasing/prevailing: Genesis 7:16, 18, 19, 19, 20, 20, 24\\n    (7 times);\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    -Of the subsiding of the waters and the exiting of the Ark: Genesis 8:1, 1,\\n    2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 17, 17, 18, 19, 19, 19, 19 (22\\n    times);\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    -Of God\\'s command to fill the earth and His promise not to destroy all\\n    flesh by another flood: Genesis 8:21, 21, 22; 9:1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 7, 7,\\n    10, 10, 10, 11, 11, 12, 12, 13, 14, 15, 15, 16, 16, 17, 19, 10:32 (28\\n    times).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    A dozen all-encompassing terms such as \"all flesh\" might be tolerable in\\n    describing a devastating flood of limited geographical area. But Scripture\\n    uses such terms 80-90 times as it describes a flood that blotted out all\\n    land-dwelling life. Similarly, a chapter might suffice to describe a local\\n    flood, but Scripture devotes five chapters to this flood. Five chapters is\\n    equal to all the Scripture that comes before-both the creation account and\\n    all pre-Flood history.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The rest of the Bible continues this global view of the Flood. Thousands of\\n    years later, God said, \"I swore that the waters of Noah should no more go\\n    over the earth\" (Isaiah 54:9). God says that just as He has kept that oath,\\n    so He will also keep His oath to love Israel. Jesus said \"the Flood\\n    destroyed them all\" (cited in two Gospels: Matthew 24:39; Luke 17:27).\\n    Peter reasons of the certainty of future judgment by using the Flood as an\\n    example: \"if (God) did not spare the ancient world&#8230;when he brought a\\n    flood upon the world of the ungodly&#8230;\" (II Peter 2:5). Later Peter\\n    divides time into two epochs: \"the world that then existed was deluged with\\n    water and perished, but&#8230;the heavens and earth that now exist are\\n    stored up for fire&#8230;,\" i.e., then&#8230;now, (II Peter 3:6-7).\\n    Scripture abounds with statements to the effect that the Flood was global.\\n    As to human authorities, Merrill F. Unger, a modern prince of biblical\\n    Hebrew, wrote in his Bible dictionary, page 372, \"In the Genesis account\\n    nothing short of a globe-encircling catastrophe is indicated.\"\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    In addition to the constant use of inclusive nouns and adjectives in the\\n    Flood account, nine major features of the Flood story support a global\\n    event-Satanic activity, design of the Ark, the years provided to build it,\\n    the duration of the Flood, the character of Noah, pre-flood geography,\\n    permission to eat animal flesh, the rainbow and repopulating the world. The\\n    Flood record begins with a brief but chilling and mysterious account of\\n    Satanic activity that worked to corrupt mankind and thus destroy God\\'s plan\\n    for man. Commentators generally overlook Satan as the cause of the\\n    explosion of human wickedness that required radical surgery, yet that is\\n    the Scriptural explanation (Genesis 6:1-4) that begins five chapters on the\\n    Flood and the repopulation of the earth.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The Ark was remarkably suited to enable the survival of its passengers. It\\n    was the largest vessel built until modern times, yet its dimensions were as\\n    sound as today\\'s ship design. How is that possible? God, not Noah,\\n    specified the dimensions of the Ark. God designed the Ark to float and hold\\n    a maximum of cargo, not travel to some destination. Basically, it was a\\n    rectangular box which would head into the wind to prevent capsizing. If the\\n    flood was local, there would be no need for a ship at all. God could simply\\n    direct the Noah party out of the danger zone. But the Ark was an\\n    ocean-going vessel for an ocean-wide flood.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Because of the wickedness of man God determined to destroy all flesh in 120\\n    years (Genesis 6:3). If the flood was local, this would give Noah enough\\n    time to make a hundred trips to the safe zone, even if it were a thousand\\n    miles away. But if the flood were to be all encompassing, Noah would need\\n    helpers and this is exactly what happened. After the 120-year warning God\\n    gave him three sons. But Noah would also have to learn the craft of ship\\n    building. Then he needed the time to train a large team of helpers.\\n    Finally, he was assigned the daunting and dangerous task of preaching the\\n    message of coming judgment during that time. The time element is consistent\\n    with a global flood.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Scripture reports that the Flood continued to rise for 150 days, covering\\n    the highest hills and taking all human life outside the Ark. By comparison\\n    the Great Mississippi Flood was the most destructive river flood in the\\n    history of the United States, with 27,000 square miles inundated in depths\\n    of up to 30 feet in early 1927. Yet it did not cover all the surrounding\\n    hills and drowned barely a fraction of the population. Following 150 days\\n    of rising water, the Ark passengers could not disembark for another 221\\n    days because it took that long for the land to dry out and be safe. When\\n    the animals were released, they would quickly travel up to hundreds of\\n    miles in all directions from the Ark and all that land had to be safe for\\n    them. No local flood has produced conditions across thousands of miles that\\n    took over a year to return to normal.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Another unique feature of the Flood is that the chief character, Noah, is\\n    ranked with Daniel and Job as the most righteous man in history (Ezekiel\\n    14:14, 20). In the entire Flood narrative God does the speaking and Noah\\n    does the obeying with no indication of hesitation or back talk. How\\n    different is the story of Moses from the burning bush to his striking of\\n    the rock. God couldn\\'t blot out such a righteous man as Noah. This world\\'s\\n    most righteous individual of the day was suitable for dealing with the\\n    world\\'s most unusual flood of all time.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    As to geography some local flood proponents suggest that mankind had not\\n    spread out worldwide, that he only occupied a small area of the world, so\\n    only a local flood was needed to blot out all flesh. This argument assumes\\n    that the geography of the earth before the Flood was the same as today.\\n    That notion has been changing over the past fifty years. Now creationists\\n    with relevant scientific backgrounds think the geography of the earth\\'s\\n    surface was vastly different before the Flood and this is consistent with\\n    Genesis chapter one. Since all the land was in one place, just one super\\n    continent existed. This condition means that man was not spread out over\\n    the entire globe but was found in just the super continent portion of the\\n    earth.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The mechanism which brought on the Flood broke up the super continent. The\\n    pieces of land moved over an unknown period of time to form today\\'s major\\n    continents and many islands. The mechanism that started this process, while\\n    not yet understood, involved a destabilizing of the earth\\'s mantle as it\\n    belched vast amounts of volcanic material. The continuing volcanic activity\\n    also sustained the warmed oceans and a thin atmospheric haze to produce the\\n    one-time conditions for an estimated 1000-year ice age which then reshaped\\n    vast portions of the deposits made by the Flood.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    God stated another worldwide change. It is so astonishing that expositors\\n    hesitate to take it at face value yet it explains how the animals and their\\n    keepers could live peaceably on the Ark for a year. Apparently, the fall\\n    did not alienate man and animals. While some humans may have harmed\\n    animals, the general population lived peaceably with them. But in some way\\n    the Flood caused a nutritional need for man that only animal flesh could\\n    supply. While God gave only the green plants for food before the Flood, He\\n    added animal flesh to man\\'s diet after the Flood. Here are the words of God\\n    Himself:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>\\n        <sup>2</sup>\\n        [God said] \"The fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every\\n        beast of the earth and upon every bird of the heavens, upon everything\\n        that creeps on the ground and all the fish of the sea. Into your hand\\n        they are delivered. <sup>3</sup>Every moving thing that lives shall be\\n        food for you. And as I gave you the green plants, I give you\\n        everything.\" Genesis 9:2-3.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Yet another unique feature of the Flood was the covenant God established\\n    between \"me and you and every living creature that is with you, for all\\n    future generations\" (Genesis 9:12) which was sealed with a sign that is\\n    seen all over the world.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>\\n        <sup>11</sup>\\n        \"Never again shall all flesh be cut off by the waters of the flood, and\\n        never again shall there be a flood to destroy the earth.\" <sup>13</sup>\\n        \"I have set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be a sign of the covenant\\n        between me and the earth. <sup>14</sup>When I bring clouds over the\\n        earth and the bow is seen in the clouds, <sup>15</sup>I will remember\\n        my covenant that is between me and you and every living creature of all\\n        flesh. And the waters shall never again become a flood to destroy all\\n        flesh. <sup>16</sup>When the bow is in the clouds, I will see it and\\n        remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature\\n        of all flesh that is on the earth\" Genesis 9:11, 13-16.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The sign of the rainbow reaches as far as Noah\\'s Flood reached. It is\\n    world-wide because the Flood was world-wide. As numerous defenders of the\\n    Bible have pointed out, vastly devastating local floods have occurred\\n    thousands of times down through the centuries, so if Noah\\'s Flood were\\n    local, God who cannot lie would have lied many times.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Lastly are the multiple statements related to repopulating the world. Six\\n    times Scripture repeats this idea:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Genesis 9:1</strong>\\n    \"And God blessed Noah and his sons and said to them, \\'Be fruitful and\\n    multiply and fill the earth.\\'\"\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Genesis 9:7</strong>\\n    \"And you (Hebrew-plural), be fruitful and multiply, increase greatly on the\\n    earth and multiply in it.\"\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Genesis 9:19</strong>\\n    \"These three were the sons of Noah, and from these the people of the whole\\n    earth were dispersed.\"\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Genesis 10:5</strong>\\n    \"From these (sons of Japheth) the coastland peoples spread in their lands,\\n    each with his own language, by their clans, in their nations.\"\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Genesis 10:32</strong>\\n    \"These are the clans of the sons of Noah, according to their genealogies,\\n    in their nations and from these the nations spread abroad on the earth\\n    after the flood.\"\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Genesis 11:8</strong>\\n    \"So the LORD dispersed them from there over the face of all the earth.\"\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    These nine unique features of the Flood utterly distinguish it from any\\n    other flood in all history.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>The Day-Age View </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Vast scientific research finds the universe billions of years old. Physics\\n    has reached the point where it recognizes that if creation began as a tight\\n    ball of infinitely hot and compact matter, it would fly apart at an\\n    astronomical rate and in 14.3 billion years spread out to today\\'s universe.\\n    In deference some creationists have sought for Scriptural agreement by\\n    interpreting the days of creation week as vast periods of time. They notice\\n    that the Hebrew noun for day has different shades of meaning as do most\\n    Hebrew words. One of those shades of meaning for \"day\" is a period of time.\\n    On this basis they view the days of creation as periods of time.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    To be sure, throughout Scripture \"day\" is used in different senses. But the\\n    laws of hermeneutics require the interpreter first to see if Scripture\\n    itself defines those days in Genesis one, and if so, to accept the\\n    Scriptural definition. So, does Scripture itself define the length of those\\n    days? Indeed it does. The fifth commandment sets up an analogy between\\n    man\\'s work week and God\\'s creation week. Israel was to follow the pattern\\n    set by God. This means Hebrews were to work six days just as God worked six\\n    days and then rest on the seventh day just as God rested on the seventh\\n    day.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>\\n        <sup>8</sup>\\n        Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. <sup>9</sup>Six days you\\n        shall labor, and do all your work, <sup>10</sup>but the seventh day is\\n        a Sabbath to the LORD your God. On it you shall not do any work, you,\\n        or your son, or your daughter&#8230;. <sup>11</sup>For in six days the\\n        LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and\\n        rested on the seventh day. Therefore the LORD blessed the Sabbath day\\n        and made it holy. Exodus 20:8-11.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    We can first eliminate any idea that the word \"day\" in verses referring to\\n    man\\'s work week was longer than a normal day. Exodus 23:12 is specific:\\n\"Six <strong>days</strong> you shall do your work, but on the seventh    <strong>day</strong> you shall rest; that your ox and your donkey may have\\n    rest, and the son of your servant woman, and the alien, may be refreshed.\"\\n    Besides Exodus 20:9-10 and 23:12, this idea is stated in yet a third place:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>\\n        <sup>2</sup>\\n        Six days work shall be done, but on the seventh day you shall have a\\n        Sabbath of solemn rest, holy to the LORD. Whoever does any work on it\\n        shall be put to death. <sup>3</sup>You shall kindle no fire in all your\\n        dwelling places on the Sabbath day. Exodus 35:2-3.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    So these three passages settle the issue of whether the days in man\\'s week\\n    were literal or not. Beyond doubt they were literal. But the question\\n    before us is \"Were God\\'s creation days literal?\" At this point, the day-age\\n    folks make an observation that might raise uncertainty. They observe that\\n    the seventh day of creation week was not framed chronologically by an\\n    evening and a morning. They are correct to the extent those words are not\\n    used in association with the seventh day. The day-age people then take\\n    their observation to the next level by saying this indicates that since the\\n    work of creation was done, God not only rested on the seventh day but is\\n    still resting today. So now, according to their reasoning, one of the days\\n    of Genesis 1:1-2:3 is longer than a normal day. In the end, they conclude\\n    all the days were longer than normal.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    A continuing seventh day is a crucial first step to their argument for the\\n    days being ages. So, they spend much time explaining the Scriptures in both\\n    the Old and New Testaments that speak of God offering His rest to humans.\\n    Then they associate those rests with the rest of God following the sixth\\n    day of creation week. While the subject could consume an entire Bible study\\n    (and pages of this book), we will state simply that each of these three\\n    rests was different. God rested for one day to set a pattern for the\\n    Sabbath rest.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The rest God offered Israel was the rest of being a nation with their own\\n    geographical territory. To acquire that land, they had to fight, not rest.\\n    To be prosperous, they had to work the land six days a week, not rest. That\\n    rest was interrupted when Assyria captured the Northern Kingdom and Babylon\\n    captured the Southern Kingdom. The rest offered since Calvary is the rest\\n    of eternal salvation, gained by believing on Jesus Christ. That rest never\\n    ends. God gives one kind of rest to Israel and another kind to NT\\n    believers. Since those are rests from the hand of God, He calls them \"My\\n    rest,\" but they are not the rest of the seventh day of creation week.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    God is working today, not resting, according to the words of Jesus: \"My\\n    father works until now and I work\" (John 5:17). At a future time, God will\\n    perform a new work of creation, a new heaven and a new earth. So the rest\\n    of God on day seven of creation week lasted one normal day. All seven days\\n    of Genesis 1:1-2:3 are literal, normal days in which God shrank millions\\n    and even billions of years of development of the universe and earth into\\n    six literal days.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Perhaps evening and morning were left out so that what was said would stand\\n    out. God blessed the seventh day, the only day of the seven He blessed.\\n    This was not a general blessing but a very specific blessing. In effect by\\n    setting the seventh day apart as holy, God consecrated it for all time.\\n    This was long before God gave the Mosaic Law. From this seventh day on, it\\n    would proclaim God as the Creator. To violate it by making it other than a\\n    normal day would be to desecrate what God made holy. Exodus 31:17 is the\\n    fullest biblical statement of the purpose of the seventh day. It signifies\\n    that God created everything in six days. Here is what it says:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>\\n        \"It is a sign forever between me and the people of Israel that in six\\n        days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested\\n        and was refreshed.\" Exodus 31:17.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    So the seventh day is a sign. For the sign to work the previous periods\\n    must be days not years or billions of years. If they are not normal days,\\n    the sign is destroyed. While the words seem repetitive, one could say \"The\\n    seventh day throughout human history witnesses to God as the Creator and\\n    that He did the work of creation in six normal days. What Scripture itself\\n    says about the seventh day is truly remarkable and what Scripture itself\\n    says needs to be the creationist\\'s focus.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Returning to the days of Genesis one, days are stated as ordinal, not\\n    cardinal numbers in the creation account. Cardinal numbers follow the\\n    pattern of \"one,\" \"two,\" \"three.\" Ordinal numbers express the order of\\n    things and follow the pattern of \"first,\" \"second,\" \"third.\" In arguing for\\n    the seventh day continuing to the present, some observe that the King James\\n    Version translated the days as a sentence: \"And the evening and the morning\\n    were the first day\" (Genesis 1:5). They are correct to the extent that the\\n    verb is not associated with the noun \"day\" but with the nouns \"evening\" and\\n    \"morning.\" The English Standard Version correctly translates: \"And there\\n    was evening and there was morning.\" The next two Hebrew words are the\\n    adjective \"first\" and the noun \"day.\" In English we would say, \"The first\\n    day.\" Some have incorrectly observed that the definite article is used for\\n    the first six days but not the seventh day. The fact is, the definite\\n    article is not found with any of the seven days. Rather, it is a given in\\n    the construction itself. This definite article argument is a red herring\\n    used to buttress the day-age view.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Some might raise objections by pointing out that \"Sabbath\" can be a day, a\\n    year or even a lot of years. True, but Scripture generally indicates which\\n    kind of a Sabbath is meant, i.e., a Sabbath day, a Sabbath year or a\\n    Sabbath of Sabbath years. For instance, Leviticus 25 introduces a\\n    particular kind of Sabbath: \"the land shall keep a Sabbath to the LORD\"\\n(Leviticus 25:2). Verses three, four and five explain: <sup>3</sup>\"For six    <strong>years</strong> you shall sow your field&#8230; <sup>4</sup>But in\\n    the seventh <strong>year</strong> there shall be a sabbath of solemn rest\\n    for the land, a Sabbath to the LORD. You shall not sow&#8230;<sup>5</sup>\\n    You shall not reap&#8230;. It shall be a solemn rest for the land.\" God\\n    permitted people to take food from it for themselves and their livestock,\\n    but for an entire year they were not to work it. The Sabbath year was for\\n    the benefit of the land. This was three millennia before modern\\n    agricultural practices.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The Sabbath year had other features outlined in the entire fifteenth\\n    chapter of Deuteronomy. \"At the end of seven <strong>years</strong> you\\nshall grant a release\" (Deuteronomy 15:1). \"He shall serve you six    <strong>years</strong> and in the seventh <strong>year</strong> you shall\\nlet him go\" (Deuteronomy 15:12). \"He has served you six    <strong>years</strong>\" (Deuteronomy 15:18). The word \"day\" is not found in\\nthis chapter because the subject is years, not days. \"At the end of seven    <strong>years</strong> in the <strong>year</strong> of release\"\\n    (Deuteronomy 31:10). On other occasions Scripture uses the word \"day\" for a\\n    normal day. \"For six <strong>days</strong> you shall eat unleavened bread\\n    and on the seventh <strong>day</strong>&#8230;\" (Deuteronomy 16:8).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    So, when the Scripture wants to speak of years, it uses that word over and\\n    over. Likewise, it uses the word \"day\" hundreds of times for an ordinary\\n    day. Why should the words for \"day\" and \"year\" be understood any\\ndifferently in Genesis 1-11? In the genealogies we read \"all the    <strong>days</strong> of Seth were 912 <strong>years</strong>\" (Genesis\\n    5:8). All those days added up to 912 years. All those days were normal\\n    days. In the same way Genesis 2:4 states, \"In the <strong>day</strong> that\\n    the LORD God made the earth and the heavens\" (Genesis 2:4). Looking back\\n    there was the first day, the second day, the third day, etc. When summed\\n    the total was six normal days.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    One troubling thought comes with the idea that according to the day-age\\n    theory, late in day six when man was created was 50,000 to 150,000 years\\n    ago. Scripture gives us 2000 years of well-established biblical history\\n    from Abraham to Christ and the 2000 years from Christ to the present. Even\\n    those 4000 years seem immense when one considers that the current signs of\\n    the times point to Christ\\'s return at any time. Saying that 46,000 to\\n    146,000 years of undescribed divine activity in the affairs of man is\\n    inconsistent with the biblical revelation of a God who acts deliberately\\n    and in a timely way. Let us prefer what the Bible says with regard to those\\n    six days of creation than an interpretation based on today\\'s science. That\\n    is the life of faith.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Many ancient people such as the Greeks and religions such as Hinduism\\n    believed that matter was eternal and evil. The 2<sup>nd</sup> law of\\n    thermodynamics states the universe is expanding indicating matter had a\\n    beginning. Creationist and astrophysicist Hugh Ross founded Reasons to\\n    Believe which confirms the Scriptural account of creation through recent\\n    scientific findings. To date he claims to have found 250 such reasons to\\n    believe the Bible. Dr. Ross is a leading defender of the day-age theory so\\n    he subscribes to the age of the creation if produced by God at the normal\\n    speed of 14.3 billion years. We believe his 14.3 billion years are better\\n    explained by a God who is all-powerful and compressed all that work into\\n    six normal days.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Dr. Ross believes that the entire universe is necessary just to support\\n    life on one planet, the earth. We agree. Of special note, he speaks of one\\n    scientific development that might well explain day two of creation week. He\\n    says that in 1999 astrophysicists discovered dark matter and estimates that\\n    it is the dominant component of the universe, currently comprising 70% of\\n    its mass. It is embedded in the edge of the universe and is fine tuned to\\n    continue the universe\\'s expansion which must happen to sustain life on\\n    earth. We believe dark matter best explains the waters above the heavens\\n    when God separated them from the earth on day two of creation week. We will\\n    know for sure in heaven, but creationists owe Dr. Ross their appreciation\\n    for his ministry of acknowledging creation as testifying to the existence\\n    of the God of the Bible.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Extra Name in Shem\\'s Genealogy</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe DSS expose an error commonly repeated by creationists who defend the    <em>MT</em>. It has to do with a second Cainan in Luke\\'s genealogy of\\n    Christ. See Appendix 8.6.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <a name=\"_Hlk86050577\">\\n        <strong>Arguments from Meaning of Names and Symmetry</strong>\\n    </a>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    A very different approach used by some creationists to determine whether\\n    the <em>LXX</em> or <em>MT</em> of Shem\\'s line is the correct reading is to\\n    study the meaning of names. These views are held by Christians with a rich\\ntradition of intense study of God\\'s Word. For their sakes    <em>Hidden Beauty</em> provides thought for their consideration, but\\nbecause this chapter is so long, see Appendix 8.7 for    <a name=\"_Hlk76823776\">our discussion of the subject. </a>\\n</p>\\n<p align=\"center\">\\n    <strong>When Were the Birthing Years Changed?</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>History of the Masoretic Text</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    We began the chapter with the puzzling problem of two Old Testament texts.\\nOne is the official Textus Receptus of Judaism, the Hebrew Masora (    <em>Masoretic Text</em>). The other is the Greek translation of a different\\n    Hebrew textual family. How do two different textual traditions square with\\n    inerrancy? Scriptural inerrancy applies only to the original writing. About\\n    98% of the OT was written in Hebrew. All agree the original autographs were\\n    lost long ago.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    After divine revelation and enablement to record it comes preservation. God\\n    used Israel to preserve the MT as is seen in the oldest existing MT, the\\n    Aleppo Codex of c. 930 AD. Looking at the details, with the fall of\\nJerusalem in 70 AD devout Jews sought to protect the copies of the    <em>MT</em> they possessed. Faithful copying continued for the next 400\\n    years. Then around 500 AD several families of priests began composing rules\\n    for copying. Over the next 400 years these rules would become the standard\\n    for copying the Hebrew Old Testament. These scribes became known as\\n    Masoretes, so eventually the text they preserved became known as the\\n    Masoretic Text. It was the same text copied at Qumran a millennium earlier.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Some charge that the Masoretes and those before them changed the text in a\\n    number of ways. They point to the change from the Phoenician script to the\\n    Chaldean block alphabet. This is a false charge because if alphabets\\n    change, for Scripture to be understood, the letters in it must also be\\n    changed. Then these critics charge that the keepers of the official text\\n    added vowels. This is true. But they also added more. Originally, the text\\n    only contained consonants and the letters of each line stood side by side\\n    without breaks. At some point the scribes added spaces between words, marks\\n    that indicated vowels, marks to show pronunciation and cantillation, and\\n    even marks to indicate paragraphs. Someone also added chapters and verses.\\n    Who would want to go back to letters without vowels or breaks from margin\\n    to margin?\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    But the critics point out that consonants without vowels can become\\n    different words depending on which vowels are used, where they are used and\\n    how many are used. For an example in English, the three consonants \"slt\"\\n    can mean entirely different things depending on these variables:\\n    salt/silt/slat/slit/slot/slut/slate/salute. But the alternative is that\\n    every reader must sort this out for himself, in effect requiring him to\\n    become an expert in this. On the basis of tradition and much learning the\\n    scribes were in a far better position to determine the correct word than\\n    the average reader. So vowel pointing actually helped to clarify the text\\n    for those seeking its guidance.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Then the critics point to the explanations the Masoretes put in the outside\\n    margin and below the text. These did not change the text at all. The\\n    Masorah parva are statistical notes in the outside margin of each page.\\n    This was all a part of counting all the words in a book or all the letters\\n    on a page, etc. That certainly didn\\'t change the text. The Masorah magna\\n    are notes below the text on each page that in effect expand on the Masorah\\n    parva. It will actually cite entire verses found elsewhere that contain a\\n    certain word. This was before the addition of chapters and verses. That\\n    didn\\'t change the text in any way.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Finally, the Critical Apparatus is the section below the Masorah magna that\\n    contains questions and uncertainties about the text. They are most helpful\\n    as a permanent reminder of variant readings and other information related\\n    to the text. Clearly, the Critical Apparatus does not change the text.\\n    Rather, it is a reminder that some question the text at that point and\\n    maybe someday the problem will be resolved. While charging that the Hebrew\\n    scribes changed the text through the centuries has taken in a lot of\\n    gullible readers; just the opposite is true. The notes in the outside\\n    margin and at the bottom of each page along with the many marks within the\\n    text have helped to improve the clarity of the text through the centuries.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Transmission of Scripture</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Along with the preservation of Scripture comes its transmission. While\\n    inspiration is completely divine and thus without error, the preservation\\n    and transmission of Scripture involve mankind. While God will never let\\n    preservation deteriorate so the message is lost, history testifies that\\n    those who have high respect for God will diligently copy and translate the\\n    Scripture. God has always had such servants. As a result, today\\'s Bible is\\n    entirely adequate to instruct the follower of God in His will. Since few\\n    speak biblical Hebrew today, God\\'s servants have translated the Bible into\\n    thousands of modern languages. It was no different in the days of Jesus and\\n    the New Testament writers. Even back then few spoke biblical Hebrew. Even\\n    then they needed a translation of the original text. But now the Old\\n    Testament is available in its original language and possibly a thousand\\n    scholars worldwide can work with the myriads of documents to determine the\\n    most exact reading. The <em>MT</em> like every other copy of the Bible has\\n    accumulated scribal errors and even deliberate changes through the years.\\n    But most importantly it is to be preferred because it is in the original\\n    language of the OT.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Development of the Old Testament Canon</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Following revelation and inspiration at some point the revelation is also\\n    recognized as authoritative and thus binding on all mankind. That is\\n    canonization. Canonization happened immediately in the case of the books of\\n    Moses. At the point where Moses completed the Pentateuch, the OT consisted\\n    of five books. They were placed in the care of the priesthood of Israel.\\n    The priesthood was responsible for preserving, teaching and transmitting\\n    the books of Moses. In time a special class of priest called scribes would\\n    be trained to make copies of God\\'s revelation.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The second clear step in the canonization of the OT came with the work of\\n    Samuel. Samuel, though a member of the tribe of Levi, was not a descendant\\n    of Aaron and thus not qualified to be an Aaronic priest. In admirable\\n    integrity he somehow prevented being called a priest in Scripture and most\\n    likely in life. But because Eli\\'s sons were wicked and Eli was elderly, God\\n    used Samuel to serve as a faithful priest during that ugly period when\\n    Eli\\'s sons were the official priests. Beyond that God began the line of\\n    prophets with Samuel. Further, as the last judge he provided the binding\\n    force of government in Israel. He was a type of Christ, combining the three\\n    functions of leadership in a society under God-prophet, priest and king\\n    (the judges were the forerunner of kings). Samuel trained Eli\\'s sons\\' sons\\n    to be faithful priests so that the next three generations of Eli\\'s\\n    descendants faithfully served the office of priest until the priesthood was\\n    transferred back to the line of Aaron through Eleazar in the days of Zadok.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    I Chronicles 9:22 credits Samuel along with David for organizing and\\n    standardizing the service of the priesthood in the Tabernacle. Samuel also\\n    scrupulously honored the canon of the Law and wrote and/or certified the\\n    books of Joshua, Judges, Ruth and most of First Samuel that tell about his\\n    ministry and David\\'s years before the death of Saul. Samuel faithfully\\n    declared God\\'s word in his lifetime so the portions of Scripture that he\\n    produced were likewise canonical when he produced them.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The third period of canonization came in the days of David and Solomon.\\n    They were neither priests nor prophets but they expressed worship and\\n    divine wisdom. Their books would begin a third section of Scripture, the\\n    writings. God showed His unique pleasure with David by giving him victories\\n    over the enemies of Israel and giving him the promise of a house that would\\n    last forever. God likewise placed His approval on Solomon by granting him\\n    the wisdom he asked for and expanding his kingdom. Later, God authenticated\\n    the books of the prophets with fulfilled prophecy. In this way the fourth\\n    period of canonization was accomplished. Finally, the work of Ezra the\\n    priest testifies to much work with Scripture. He would have completed the\\n    Old Testament Scripture except for brief portions added after his time.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Jesus refers to Scripture several hundred times with various statements\\n    such as \"It is written\" or \"Moses said.\" On the day of his resurrection\\n    \"Beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he interpreted to them in all\\n    the Scriptures the things concerning himself\" (Luke 24:27). On a later\\n    post-resurrection appearance he said, \"Everything written about me in the\\n    Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled\" (Luke\\n    24:44). These are the three sections of the Old Testament. The next verse\\n    says \"He opened their minds to understand the Scriptures\" (Luke 24:45). God\\n    the Son called these writings Scripture. Thirty years later the Apostle\\n    Paul would write \"All Scripture is God-breathed\" (II Timothy 3:16).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The DSS make no distinction between these books called Scripture and the\\n    many other religious books in the collection. From this DSS scholars\\n    conclude that the OT canon was not yet established in Israel at that time.\\n    It is true that no body of believers had yet certified a list of divinely\\n    inspired books. But while unbelievers may have been uncertain about which\\n    books belonged to that category, the words of Jesus in the Gospels and the\\n    writings of the Apostles in the rest of the New Testament show that the\\n    godly knew which books were Scripture. Therefore, canonization by a large\\n    body of Christians must not be confused with the recognition of\\n    authoritative books by believers.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The voice of the splinter group at Qumran that disappeared from 70 AD until\\n    the discovery of the DSS cannot begin to compare with the voice of the New\\n    Testament church which became a major movement within the entire Roman\\n    Empire and constantly spoke of \"Scripture.\" The community at Qumran was\\n    entirely comfortable with writing books of religious fiction and storing\\n    them beside the books of the OT. These were the kind of anti-OT material NT\\nwriters warned about. Undoubtedly Paul had such Qumranian favorites as the    <em>Book of Jubilees</em> and the <em>Book of Enoch</em> in mind when he\\n    instructed Timothy to \"charge certain persons not to teach any different\\n    doctrine, nor to devote themselves to myths&#8230;\" (I Timothy 1:3-4).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The Apostle\\'s words \"Certain persons&#8230;have wandered away into vain\\n    discussion, desiring to be teachers of the law [but] without\\n    understanding&#8230;what they are saying\" (I Timothy 1:6-7) would have\\n    included the Qumranians\\' extensive teaching of the law in their sectarian\\n    books such as the <em>Community Rule</em>. Of the Qumranian type of\\n    asceticism he wrote \"Now the Spirit expressly says that in later times some\\n    will depart from the faith by devoting themselves to deceitful spirits and\\n    teachings of demons&#8230; who forbid marriage and require abstinence from\\n    foods that God created to be received with thanksgiving&#8230;\" (I Timothy\\n    4:1-3).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Further, only individual OT books were found at Qumran, not groups of books\\n    bound together to indicate they were equally authoritative. To dismiss the\\n    DSS because they were the product of heretics is to miss their value. But\\n    to overstate their meaning with such statements as \"they prove there was no\\n    OT canon during the Second Temple [Herod\\'s Temple] Period\" is equally\\n    harmful. What they do show is that various versions of the OT existed\\n    between 100 BC and 70 AD, that scribes faithfully copied them through the\\n    centuries to follow and that by far the preferred OT text at Qumran was the\\n    basis of the Masoretic Text.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Finally, When Were the Birthing Years Changed?</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    As reported earlier, Emanuel Tov has concluded that the Samaritan\\n    Pentateuch and the Hebrew forerunner of the LXX were originally one\\n    document. Since the Samaritan Pentateuch was composed after Solomon when\\n    Israel separated from Judah, the years could have been changed any time\\n    after that. Solomon\\'s kingdom gained a much greater understanding of the\\n    history of Israel\\'s neighbors, so seeds for changing those numbers could\\n    have formed that early.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    But why would the Jerusalem Elders select a text for translation into Greek\\n    that was only 1/7<sup>th</sup> as popular as the preferred Torah text at\\n    Qumran? That question can be answered by another question: \"Wouldn\\'t they\\n    select the version they felt would best be received in the Greek world?\"\\n    They would have had broad knowledge of Greek thinking. They knew the Greeks\\n    believed in more years of civilization than the majority Hebrew text\\n    reported. It apparently was a small thing to them to carry to Alexandria\\n    the Hebrew text that recognized the most years since they knew the Greeks\\n    believed the Great Pyramid of Giza was built 300 years before the Flood\\n    date found in the majority Hebrew text.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    How tragic that the 70 had become so insensitive to their own sacred\\n    writings that they could not recognize the very nature of Hebrew\\n    genealogies, that they were about identification of descendants with\\n    ancestors and ancestors with descendants rather than records of precise\\n    succession.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Weighing the LXX Textual Quality</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    As textual scholars study the two texts, they find occasional scribal\\n    errors in the MT that can be corrected from the LXX text. See Appendix 8.7\\n    for four such instances. Appendix 8.7 also explains how changes in the LXX\\n    directed the location of Abraham\\'s homeland to Urfa in Northwest\\n    Mesopotamia instead of Ur 700 miles to the Southeast.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Our next three chapters become a unit on the Book of Job. They describe a\\n    world awash in history eight or nine generations before Peleg but many\\n    generations after Eber. They add further evidence of a global flood nearly\\n    two millennia before Ussher\\'s too late Flood date (2348 BC).\\n</p>\\n<br clear=\"all\"/>\\n<div>\\n    <br clear=\"all\"/>\\n    <hr width=\"33%\" size=\"1\" align=\"left\"/>\\n    <div id=\"ftn1\">\\n        <p>\\n            <a href=\"#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\" title=\"\">[1]</a>\\nPete Williams, \"Some Remarks Preliminary to a Biblical Chronology,\"            <em>Journal of Creation</em>, 12(1) April 1998: 98-106.\\n        </p>\\n    </div>\\n    <div id=\"ftn2\">\\n        <p>\\n            <a href=\"#_ftnref2\" name=\"_ftn2\" title=\"\">[2]</a>\\n            Emanuel Tov, \"The Biblical DSS as Representing Variety in Judaism\\n            and Early Christianity,\" posted 3/2020; (Search on the Title).\\n        </p>\\n    </div>\\n    <div id=\"ftn3\">\\n        <p>\\n            <a href=\"#_ftnref3\" name=\"_ftn3\" title=\"\">[3]</a>\\n            Tov, ibid.\\n        </p>\\n    </div>\\n    <div id=\"ftn4\">\\n        <p>\\n            <a href=\"#_ftnref4\" name=\"_ftn4\" title=\"\">[4]</a>\\n            Emanuel Tov, \"The Genealogical Lists in Genesis 5 and 11 in Three\\n            Different Versions,\" 37-52.

The goal of this and the next two chapters is to\\n    showcase the many ways that do date Job. As a consequence, his life and\\n    times demand an earlier Flood date. The following ideas will be examined in\\n    these three chapters:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    1. Job lived 280 years which places his birth in the 35-55 generation gap\\n    between Eber and Peleg.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    2. Job lived when dinosaurs dwelt with no fear of humans in the Jordan\\n    Valley.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    3. Job lived in the declining years of the Great Ice Age and contains 15\\n    distinct kinds of ice age phenomena.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    4. God orchestrated Job\\'s ordeal to show mankind how malicious and\\n    dangerous Satan is. This message was needed early in post-Flood history.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    5. Job descended from Shem through Aram and Uz. Knowledge of God was still\\n    abundant in his land. A far different picture is seen in that same land in\\n    the days of Sodom and Gomorrah, half a millennium later.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    6. Peleg\\'s name means \"divided by water\" and most likely refers to the\\n    closing days of the Ice Age when glacial melt and the subsequent rising sea\\n    level covered land bridges between continents.\\n</p>\\n<p align=\"center\">\\n    <strong>280-Year Lifespan</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    We must start with Job\\'s lifespan found at the end of the book. In his\\n    extreme pain Job had said regrettable things about God. After he repented\\n    and prayed for his friends the book concludes by reporting that God doubled\\n    all he had (Job 42:10). This doubling included ten more children, the same\\n    number that perished at the time of Satan\\'s attack. Why not 20? Job only\\n    needed ten more to double the original ten because he would have all 20\\n    with him forever in heaven. His years followed the same pattern. He lived\\n    140 years after his ordeal (Job 42:16). His ordeal had not erased from his\\n    mind the memories of those former years of walking with God and building a\\n    ranching empire. Doubling his years was like doubling his children-he lived\\n    for 140 years after his ordeal to double the 140 years he lived before his\\n    ordeal, giving him a total lifespan of 280 years.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The above is our conclusion, but how did we get there? Job chapter 42\\n    begins with the doubling of his animals, not his children or his years.\\n    Verse 12 says \"he had 14,000 sheep, 6,000 camels 1,000 yoke of oxen, and\\n    1,000 female donkeys.\" These numbers are exactly twice as many animals as\\n    he had just before his ordeal, for Job 1:3 states, \"He possessed 7,000\\n    sheep, 3,000 camels, 500 yoke of oxen, and 500 female donkeys.\" Then came\\n    the attack of the enemy. Fire from heaven took the sheep. Chaldeans stole\\n    the camels and Sabeans plundered the oxen and donkeys. Job never saw them\\n    again. After his ordeal relatives showed him sympathy and gave him money\\n    and gold (Job 42:11). With this start he began to rebuild his stock. By the\\n    end of his life 140 years later Scripture reports that he had exactly twice\\n    as many animals as before Satan\\'s attack. Indeed, God did double his\\n    livestock.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Doubling Job\\'s Children</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Next, Scripture speaks of his children. After Job\\'s ordeal, Scripture\\n    states that \"He had also seven sons and three daughters\" (Job 42:13). To do\\n    this God obviously restored his health. Ten is the same number that he\\n    originally had for Job 1:2 reported \"There were born to him seven sons and\\n    three daughters.\" Satan killed them all by sending a wind that collapsed\\n    the house of the oldest brother where they were celebrating. But there is\\n    an apparent problem. On the one hand \"The LORD gave Job twice as much as he\\n    had before\" (Job 42: 10). On the other hand, the LORD gave him only ten\\n    more children, not twenty. Why only ten more? Wouldn\\'t it take twenty to\\n    double them? The answer is that there is a fundamental difference between\\n    Job\\'s animals and his children. Those first animals were lost to Job\\n    forever. Job would never see them again. But those first seven sons and\\n    three daughters were not lost forever when the great wind took them.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Job\\'s family believed in the true God, the Creator. When they were killed,\\n    they went to glory and are there with Job today along with the second set\\n    of ten. Job has twenty sons and daughters with him forever. God did double\\n    his children even though doubling them would only take giving him ten more\\n    whereas doubling his animals would require heaven to stock his land with\\n    twice the number he had before his ordeal. Heaven\\'s math is flawless.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Doubling Job\\'s Years</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Finally, the last verse of Job states that he lived 140 years after his\\n    ordeal. We understand those years matched the years before his ordeal. But\\n    280 years places his birth before that of Abraham, Terah, Serug, Reu and\\n    even Peleg. No known commentator views Job to have lived 280 years.\\n    Invariably Job is given a shorter lifespan. Why? Where do they go astray?\\n    Job 42:9 says \"The LORD restored the fortunes of Job.\" Job 42:12 says \"the\\n    LORD blessed the latter days of Job more than his beginning,\" while 42:10\\n    is more specific: \"The LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before.\" Then\\n    Scripture gives specific numbers in three categories-his animals, his\\n    children and his years.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Many students of Scripture conclude the doubling only applied to his\\n    cattle. They reason that while he received twice as many animals but only\\n    the same number of children as before, the doubling only applied to\\n    material possessions. They conclude that only ten more would contradict the\\n    statement that God doubled all he had so the doubling only applied to his\\n    animals. Yet others do include his children but not his years. Some even\\n    include his years but state that he lived 70 years before his ordeal and\\n    God doubled that number after his ordeal, so that he lived a total of 210\\n    years (70+140=210).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    It is true that Job involves much mystery, especially about when he lived\\n    and when the book was written; the ideas and form of poetry are so\\n    advanced-how could the events have taken place so early? Some find the time\\n    of the Patriarchs to be a good fit because Jacob\\'s twin brother Esau had a\\n    son named Eliphaz (Genesis 36:4, 10, 11). They suggest he was the leader of\\n    the three friends who came to comfort Job. The Eliphaz in the book of Job\\n    was from Teman and a town by that name existed in Edom, the nation Esau\\nfounded. Others notice that    <a name=\"__DdeLink__10783_547388351\">Issachar</a>\\'s third son was Yob (Job)\\n    and suggest that he might have decided to go out on his own after Jacob\\n    moved his people to Egypt, settling in the Sinai Peninsula where they say\\n    Job lived. They strengthen this argument by adding that Moses may have\\n    known him during the forty years Moses lived in the Sinai with Jethro, the\\n    priest of Midian. They suggest this was how Moses learned Job\\'s story.\\n    (Jewish tradition holds Moses to be the author of Job.)\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    But people weren\\'t living to the age of 280 or even 210 in Esau\\'s day.\\n    Esau\\'s brother Jacob lived 147 years, Levi lived 137 years and Moses lived\\n    120 years. Further, names are often repeated in Scripture. Most tellingly,\\n    the city of Teman existed before it was taken over by the Edomites. The\\n    whole idea of Issachar\\'s son leaving Jacob\\'s extended family in Egypt is\\n    unlikely. Finally, Job knowing Moses is impossible since the Eliphaz who\\n    was Esau\\'s son would have lived when Jacob moved his people to Egypt,\\n    hundreds of years before Moses was born.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Still others disregard the length of Job\\'s life entirely and suggest he\\n    lived during or shortly before the days of David because the poetry of Job\\n    is like that of Psalms and Solomon\\'s books. But by that time the average\\n    lifespan was 70, only half as long as Job lived after his ordeal. In the\\n    discourses Eliphaz refutes Job\\'s position by asking if Job was so old that\\n    he possessed all knowledge. \"Are you the first man who was born? Or were\\n    you brought forth before the hills? Have you listened in the council of\\n    God? And do you limit wisdom to yourself?\" Job 15:8-9. Eliphaz next answers\\n    his question with \"Both the gray-haired and the aged are among us, older\\n    than your father\" 15:10.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Job was not near the end of his life when Satan struck. His father was\\n    still alive and people even older than his father described as \"the\\n    gray-haired and the aged\" were living in his day. Nevertheless, in chapter\\n    42 God says that Job spoke correctly about Him while his three comforters\\n    did not which indicates he already had to have lived many years to gain his\\n    knowledge of God. Therefore, Job had already lived many years at the time\\n    of his ordeal and others were considerably older.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    So, the usual practice is to focus on the animals but not dwell on his\\n    children or years. What does Scripture do? His animals are mentioned first;\\n    they were the least important, the most superficial; there is no\\n    elaboration. His children were far more important so Scripture not only\\n    reports their number but elaborates significantly on them. Lastly, his\\n    years were the most important of all. Scripture reports their number and\\n    elaborates on them with unusual detail as well. This structuring reinforces\\n    the idea that the doubling applied to his children and his lifespan as well\\n    as his animals. When they are viewed in this light, only one conclusion\\n    remains-Job\\'s children set the pattern for the doubling of his years. Job\\n    lived a total of 280 years.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Four Generations in Job\\'s Second Family</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    What Scripture says about those years after his ordeal reinforces our view.\\n    The sequence begins with \"After this Job lived 140 years\" (Job 42:16). For\\n    perspective Abraham lived a total of 175 years so 140 is just 35 years\\n    short of Abraham\\'s entire lifetime. Jacob lived 147 years or just seven\\n    years longer than Job\\'s years following his ordeal. Next it says \"[He] saw\\n    his sons, and his sons\\' sons, four generations\" (Job 42:16). The first\\n    generation would be those seven sons and three daughters. If Job recovered\\n    his health over the next ten years, he would have begun fathering/begetting\\n    children ten years into the second 140 years. At the standard rate of\\n    gaining maturity at the age of 32, the second generations would have begun\\n    42 years into Job\\'s 2<sup>nd</sup> 140 years. The third generation would\\n    have begun when he was 74 years into the second 140. Finally, the fourth\\n    generation would have begun when he was 106 years into the second 140\\n    years. This is about right mathematically because when he was 140, the\\n    first of the fifth generation would have just been born.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Wouldn\\'t this also have been true before his ordeal? If so, the first\\n    generation would be 32-50 years younger than him making him begin when he\\n    was 32, the second when he was 64, the third when he was 96 and the fourth\\n    when he was 128. Being 140 years old at the time of his ordeal fits while\\n    being 70 does not.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Furthermore, the only activity mentioned of his first batch of ten children\\n    is \"eating and drinking,\" and \"feasting.\" They held feasts in the house of\\n    each one on his day and their sisters would join them (Job 1:4). The feasts\\n    lasted for multiple days and Job was not present because the text says\\n    \"When the days of the feast had run their course, Job would send and\\n    consecrate them&#8230;. Thus Job did continually\" Job 1:5. This lifestyle\\n    sounds more geared to retired or semi-retired people. Yet if he was only\\n    70, the oldest would have been 38 while the youngest would have been 20\\n    meaning that most of them had not even reached adulthood. But if he were\\n    140 when they were killed, the oldest would have been 108 and the youngest\\n    90.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The servant who brought the terrible news called them young people: \"their\\n    oldest brother\\'s house &#8230; fell on the young people and they are dead\"\\n    Job 1:18-19. \"Young people\" is a relative term, frequently used by an older\\n    generation for the next generation regardless of age. If they were 90-108\\n    and Job was 140, \"young people\" would be appropriate. Further, they were\\n    not living with their parents any longer. Each owned his own home and ran\\n    his own life. Thus, his children\\'s easy lifestyle adds further support to\\n    the idea that Job had lived many more than 70 years and his first ten\\n    children were far older than 20-38 when Satan struck.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Some will dismiss this line of reasoning as speculative but it logically\\n    applies the pattern given by Scripture and it is such specific patterns as\\n    found in all the numbers in the lines of Adam and Shem that make the\\n    Scripture believable, not mythical.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Support for 280 Years from the Circumstances of His Death</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Finally, Scripture concludes its elaboration on his years by stating the\\n    circumstances of his death: \"And Job died, an old man, and full of days\"\\n    Job 42:17. These words are standard statements in Scripture for living a\\n    full life rather than a life cut short prematurely or unusually extended.\\n    His 140 years were not miracle years other than being restored to health so\\n    he could live the standard lifetime of his day. Abraham\\'s death received\\n    the same Scriptural notice:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>\\n        <sup>7</sup>\\nThese are the days of the years of Abraham\\'s life, 175 years.        <sup>8</sup>Abraham breathed his last and died in a good old age, an\\n        old man and full of years. Genesis 25:7-8.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    An entirely separate line of reasoning involves the hints of many years\\n    before his ordeal. The book shows he knew much about God. He also was\\n    careful in his worship of God, always consecrating his sons and daughters\\n    after each round of their feasting. Job 1:4-5. Of all people God chose him\\n    to expose the unseen enemy of mankind. All this suggests many years of\\n    spiritual growth. The size of his ranch suggests he had been at it for a\\n    long time. His position of highest respect in the nearby town suggests the\\n    passing of many years. The discourses ask if he were so old he knew all\\n    things. The very fact that the spiritual leaders of his area came to\\n    comfort him suggests that he had been around a long time. Job\\'s 280 year\\n    lifespan is but the first of many reasons to place his birth half a\\n    millennium before Abraham\\'s. (See Appendix 11.1 for a list of thirteen\\n    reasons for dating Job early.)\\n</p>\\n<p align=\"center\">\\n    <strong>Job\\'s Character and World</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>\\n        <sup>1</sup>\\n        There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job, and that man was\\nblameless and upright, one who feared God and turned away from evil.<sup>2</sup>There were born to him seven sons and three daughters.        <sup>3</sup>He possessed 7,000 sheep, 3,000 camels, 500 yoke of oxen,\\n        and 500 female donkeys, and very many servants, so that this man was\\n        the greatest of all the people of the east. Job 1:1-3.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    This opening paragraph introduces Job as a man without blame. Not that he\\n    was sinless, but as people looked at his life, they recognized qualities\\n    like honesty, justice and compassion. Upright comes from straight or\\n    correct. It answers to righteousness. Job had a high regard for God and\\n    walked according to His standards.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The words describing Job\\'s character are in the very first verse of this\\n    sixth longest Old Testament book. But they are repeated and they come from\\n    the very mouth of God when God says to Satan, \"Have you considered my\\n    servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a blameless and\\n    upright man, who fears God and turns away from evil?\" Job 1:8. This time\\n    God adds that Job is at the top of the ladder, in a class all by himself,\\n    that there was none like him on the earth. Job was the most righteous man\\n    alive in his day.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    That is not all. After Satan had destroyed all of Job\\'s wealth and caused\\n    all ten of his children to perish, God repeated the phrase: \"Have you\\n    considered my servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a\\n    blameless and upright man, who fears God and turns away from evil? He still\\n    holds fast his integrity, although you incited me against him to destroy\\n    him without reason\" Job 2:3. In the face of losing all his possessions and\\n    ten kids, he retained his integrity. In spite of this crushing blow he was\\n    still in a class all of his own. None was like him in living the way God\\n    intended man to live.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The suffering Job endured is so horrible that some feel his account is more\\n    of an allegory, a story designed to teach God\\'s children to trust Him in\\n    the worst that could be imagined. No human could possible survive that,\\n    goes this thinking. Yet he is mentioned as a real person in both the Old\\n    and New Testaments. James 5:11 speaks of his exemplary patience.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    In Ezekiel 14:14 and 20 God emphasizes how certain is the coming judgment\\n    by saying to Ezekiel, \"Even if these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were\\n    in it [the land God was judging], they would deliver but their own lives by\\n    their righteousness, declares the Lord God\" (14:14). In verse 20 God\\n    repeats this statement with an oath: \"As I live declares the Lord God. They\\n    would deliver neither son nor daughter. They would deliver but their own\\n    lives by their righteousness.\" Both Noah and Daniel are regarded as men who\\n    really lived. In fact Daniel was alive when God gave this prophecy to\\n    Ezekiel. This certainly argues that like Noah and Daniel, Job was a real\\n    person. The experience of Job is more than a moral lesson. It is a record\\n    of events that actually happened.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Job\\'s Family Business</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The next verses describe his enormous ranch, large family and active\\n    worship of the true God. Verse three mentions 500 yoke of oxen, 500\\n    donkeys, 7000 sheep, 3000 camels, very many servants and summarizes: \"This\\n    man was the greatest of all the people of the east.\" The numbers are\\n    impressive. For instance if his 3000 camels were roped at 25\\' intervals,\\n    the caravan would stretch over 14 miles. More seriously, not many today are\\n    familiar with how such animals could be employed to make Job the wealthiest\\n    man \"in the east.\" So let us look at the operation and size of such a ranch\\n    on the basis of general standards of production for these animals.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Essentially Job owned an enormous family business complex consisting of\\n    three major divisions: farming, manufacturing and trading. Each\\n    complimented the other and made maximum use of his work force. The work\\n    year began with spring planting. One ox can pull a plow. A yoke of two\\n    provide both power and endurance. The man wrestling with the plow would\\n    wear out long before two oxen. But someone needed to make sure the oxen\\n    stayed on course, so one man would lead them while the other muscled the\\n    plow. When the plow man became exhausted, they would trade jobs. Following\\n    them would be people to break up clods and smooth the dirt. Last of all\\n    would come the planters.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Division One: Farming</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    During planting season most of Job\\'s available community chipped in,\\n    essentially moving into the field. Each yoke involved a family or two,\\n    possibly a total of ten people including women and older children. Thus\\n    5000 people would make the greatest use of Job\\'s 500 yoke of oxen. Being a\\n    godly man, Job would make sure his workers had a day of rest. Then time was\\n    needed setting up field camps where the oxen plowed. Most of the area was\\n    composed of rather narrow valleys or bands of fertile soil broken up by\\n    numerous rocky hills, plateaus, mountainous regions and wilderness.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Now it becomes obvious why the donkeys were needed. They brought both\\n    provisions to the field camp(s), sometimes as far as 20 miles from\\n    headquarters and supplies for planting. The various crops were planted at\\n    different times. Possibly the planting season extended over ten weeks which\\n    allowed for about 50 plowing days after subtracting the days for moving,\\n    rest and bad weather. If each yoke plowed two acres a day, 500 yoke would\\n    plow 1000 acres a day or 50,000 in 50 days. A square mile contains 640\\n    acres, so 50,000 acres amounts to 78 square miles.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    When the Sabeans stole Job\\'s oxen (Job 1:15), the donkeys were feeding\\n    beside them. Apparently Job practiced crop rotation, leaving a portion of\\n    the fertile land to rest each year. The oxen fed on this resting land at\\n    night and during the non-plowing season as well. Manure from the animals\\n    further enriched the fallowing soil for its next cycle of planting. Because\\n    the area was becoming more arid, possibly one-third of Job\\'s total arable\\n    land rested each year. Adding this land to the land being plowed brings the\\n    total land that could be cultivated to 100 plus square miles.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Crops matured for harvest at different times as well, so harvesting also\\n    lasted for about two months. Again all available personnel were needed for\\n    the harvest. During the harvest season donkeys carried loads in both\\n    directions-taking provisions out to the field workers and returning with\\n    the harvested crops.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Division Two: Manufacturing</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Wool from Job\\'s 7000 sheep would supply his manufacturing division as well\\n    as provide meat for his employees and sacrifices for worshiping the LORD.\\n    Possibly ten garments could be made from the spring shearing of each\\n    animal. While keeping the sheep involved about 300 men and older boys, more\\n    help would be needed at shearing time. When the women weren\\'t in the field\\n    for planting or harvesting, they would be making garments (70,000 a year\\n    from 7000 sheep). Many would clothe Job\\'s community; the rest would be\\n    available for trade.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Division Three: Trading</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Job\\'s 3000 camels explain his great wealth. They formed his trading\\n    division, carrying his farming surplus and manufacturing products\\n    throughout the region. They would have been resting during planting and\\n    harvesting while all available hands were involved in those efforts. During\\n    the trading season each caravan might involve ten to twenty camels, 150-300\\n    caravans. Each twenty-camel caravan consisted of camel drivers, skilled\\n    traders and guards, possibly ten men. While camels can walk all day at four\\n    miles per hour, to save their energy for carrying products, the men with\\n    them did not ride; they walked except, per chance, for a few elderly,\\n    highly skilled traders. Those walking limited the caravan to 20-25 miles a\\n    day.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    During the trading season about 2000 of the men of Job\\'s ranch including\\n    most of the strongest men were involved in caravan operations. Another 300\\n    cared for the sheep, 200 cared for the donkeys and oxen and still hundreds\\n    of others provided services for the ranching community and mansions of Job\\n    and his seven semi-retired sons. Possibly 3000 working age men were a part\\n    of Job\\'s operation. With retirees, women and children, his entire community\\n    could have numbered 12,000.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Job\\'s operations stretched over 1000 square miles, given all the unusable\\n    land within which he found 100 square miles suitable for farming and\\n    another 50 for the grazing of sheep and camels. The area of his land\\n    compares favorably with the famous King Ranch of Texas, USA with its 1300\\n    square miles.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Social Life of Job\\'s Adult Children</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Each of Job\\'s seven sons had his own house. With Job at 140, his sons would\\n    be around 100 and have children, grandchildren and even great\\n    grandchildren. \"His sons used to go and hold a feast in the house of each\\n    one on his day, and they would send and invite their three sisters to eat\\n    and drink with them.\" (Job 1:4) \"His day\" is commonly understood to be the\\n    birthday of each son. \"And when the days of the feast had run their course,\\n    Job would send and consecrate them, and he would rise early in the morning\\n    and offer burnt offerings according to the number of them all.\" (Job 1:5)\\n    \"Days of the feast\" and \"run their course\" sounds like multiple days for\\n    each feast and cycles of celebrating. It could be that \"his day\" was a\\n    designated day on the calendar like the first day of each new moon or the\\n    first day of each quarter to kick off another cycle of feasting at each\\n    brother\\'s house.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Priestly Function of Job</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Following each cycle, regardless of their frequency, Job diligently\\n    performed the service of family priest, consecrating each son and offering\\n    a burnt sacrifice for each. The idea that he was very conscientious in this\\n    expression of faith is reinforced with \"Thus Job did continually\" (Job\\n    1:5). So even though his vast business operation undoubtedly kept him very\\n    busy, he was not too busy to find time to worship God. What previous men of\\n    faith had learned of God was available in Job\\'s day and on the basis of\\n    this verbal Bible Job had established a strong trust in God.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The next section will provide numerous further reasons to conclude Job was\\n    born nearly 300 years before Peleg rather than 400-1200 years after Peleg.\\n    While it would not seem so, the location of Job\\'s ranch is a significant\\n    element in determining when Job was born.\\n</p>\\n<p align=\"center\">\\n    <strong>Location of Job\\'s Ranch</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    That very first verse also tells where he lived: \"There was a man in the\\n    land of Uz whose name was Job&#8230;\" So, who was Uz and where was his land\\n    located? Determining all this takes some detective work but many clues are\\n    available to provide a reasonable answer. One Uz is found among the\\n    earliest people in the line of Shem. Shem had a son named Aram who fathered\\n    a son named Uz. This Uz is found in both the genealogies of the Table of\\n    Nations and those in Chronicles.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>\\n        The sons of Shem: Elam, Asshur, Arpachshad, Lud, and Aram. The sons of\\n        Aram: Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash. Genesis 10:22-23.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>\\n        The sons of Shem: Elam, Asshur, Arpachshad, Lud, and Aram. And the sons\\n        of Aram: Uz, Hul, Gether, and Meshech. I Chronicles 1:17.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Aram was among those born in the first generation after the Flood; thus his\\n    son Uz was born in the second. Further, Uz was Aram\\'s firstborn. While\\n    these are obvious facts they are extremely important and must not be\\n    overlooked. They mean he was on the ground floor in obtaining land in the\\n    years after the population scattered following the Tower of Babel judgment.\\n    His father must have taken his family west because his descendants, the\\n    Aramaeans, came to occupy portions of modern Syria, Jordan and western\\n    Arabia. As the firstborn, Uz received choice land-much of what is today\\n    Jordan and western Saudi Arabia. A substantial population developed across\\n    this region and a millennium later Job was born. He possessed a large\\n    amount of land, had incredible business skills, was commendably godly, and\\n    attracted thousands of folks to his ranching enterprise. He exhibited the\\n    best qualities of the Shem-Aram-Uz line.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Godliness, Sunrise, Chaldeans, Sabeans and Camels </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Besides the person for whom the land was named, many other clues help\\n    locate Job\\'s ranch. God says Job was \"blameless and upright, one who feared\\n    God and turned away from evil\" (Job 1:1b). Like his ancestor Noah who lived\\n    a thousand years before, Job was a spiritual beacon in his day. Very\\n    possibly Noah\\'s Shem-Aram-Uz branch remained true to Noah\\'s God during this\\n    entire period. Each of the five men who spoke in Job came from different\\n    people groups yet were descendants of Aram or influenced by Aram\\'s\\n    descendants. How else to explain their sound knowledge of God?\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Another geographical clue is found in Job 1:3: \"He was the greatest of all\\n    the people of the east.\" The word \"east\" is \"sunrise.\" Directions were in\\n    relation to Israel. But since Abraham did not enter Canaan until half a\\n    millennium later, how can this phrase be explained? The answer lies in the\\n    work of the Holy Spirit who led the editor/writer to include this in the\\n    book\\'s final form. This statement locates Job\\'s ranch more to the east of\\n    Israel rather than to the north as in Syria or to the south as in the\\n    Sinai.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The assaults of the Sabeans for Job\\'s oxen (Job 1:15) and Chaldeans for\\n    Job\\'s camels (Job 1:17) point to a west to northwest Arabia location. The\\n    Sabeans were famous marauding nomads from the depths of the Arabian\\n    wilderness to the east. As to the Chaldeans the servant was very specific.\\n    Their style was distinctive; they were well organized; they executed their\\n    attack military style. Clearly, they were well known in Job\\'s day. In later\\n    times they occupied a land north of Mesopotamia so they either migrated\\n    north over the centuries from where they lived in this early period or this\\n    was a splinter group. This might place Job\\'s ranch more to the northern\\n    portion of the land of Uz.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Camels are another clue to where and when Job lived. While donkeys were\\n    used for local transport, camels carried goods long distances. The camel\\n    does not have a hoof. Instead, it is equipped with a large leathery pad\\n    that prevents it from sinking into the sand. Their long legs distanced them\\n    further from the hot earth than the legs of donkeys or horses so they were\\n    better fitted for hot desert temperatures. They could walk for days between\\n    watering spots. As will be seen later, Arabia was covered with vegetation\\n    due to hypercyclones until the waning days of the Ice Age. As the Ice Age\\n    came to an end and desert regions increased, camels became the standard\\n    pack animals.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Job spoke of the caravans of Sheba and Tema. The countries of Sheba, home\\n    to the Queen of Sheba in southwestern Arabia and Tema which was NW of Sheba\\n    were famous for trading all across Arabia. Job would have been very\\n    familiar with them and their countless trading routes. His 3000 camels\\n    would also have been familiar sights across much of Arabia. This places Job\\n    on the fringe of the Arabian desert where he could still farm successfully\\n    but also trade in the desert regions to the east.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Other References to\"the Land of Uz\"</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Very important clues come from the other two times the land of Uz is\\n    mentioned in the Old Testament. Both references are found in the writings\\n    of Jeremiah which date two millennia after Job\\'s ordeal. By that time\\n    nations had formed in parts of the land of Uz so they help to identify the\\n    entire region of Uz. In Jeremiah 25:15-26 God directs the prophet to make\\n    the nations drink the cup of His judgment. This judgment consists of defeat\\n    in warfare. Many nations and kingdoms are in this passage. The list,\\n    however, contains an order. It begins and ends with the two nations that\\n    treated Israel the worst-Egypt and Babylon who were the first and last to\\n    be judged by God. But it also seems to be a listing of nations from closest\\n    to Israel to those more distant. The following is an attempt to pick out\\n    the names of the nations without citing the entire content of these twelve\\n    verses:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>\\n        <sup>15</sup>\\n        Thus the LORD, the God of Israel, said to me \"Take from my hand this\\n        cup of the wine of wrath, and make all the nations to whom I send you\\ndrink it:\" <sup>18</sup>Jerusalem and the cities of Judah;        <sup>19</sup>Pharaoh king of Egypt, his servants, his officials, all\\n        his people, <sup>20</sup>and all the mixed tribes among them; all the\\n        kings of the land of Uz and all the kings of the land of the\\nPhilistines, <sup>21</sup>Edom, Moab, and the sons of Ammon;        <sup>22</sup>all the kings of Tyre, all the kings of Sidon, and all the\\nkings of the coastland across the sea; <sup>23</sup>Dedan, Tema, Buz;        <sup>24</sup>all the kings of Arabia and all the kings of the mixed\\n        tribes who dwell in the desert, <sup>25</sup>all the kings of Zimri,\\n        all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of Media; <sup>26</sup>all the\\n        kings of the north, far and near, one after another, and all the\\n        kingdoms of the world. After them the king of Babylon shall drink.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    God begins with Jerusalem and Judah, the heart of Israel. Then come the\\n    bordering countries of Uz, Philistia, Edom, Moab, Ammon, Tyre and Sidon.\\n    Philistia bordered Israel on her southwest; Edom, Moab and Ammon were those\\n    small nations that bordered her on her south and east. Tyre and Sidon were\\n    the small people groups immediately to Israel\\'s northwest. The list\\n    concludes with countries more distant from Israel-the coastlands, Dedan,\\n    Tema, Buz, Arabia, the desert, Zimri, Elam and Media.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Remarkably when this list gets into specific geographical regions bordering\\n    Israel, the very first area is Uz. The next nations were to Israel\\'s\\n    southwest, south, southeast, east and northwest, leaving only her north and\\n    northeast for Uz. Damascus representing Syria to her north is absent from\\n    this list which suggests that Damascus had already been conquered by\\n    Babylon. The only region left for Uz is the northeast border of Israel.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Lamentations 4:21 confirms the above: \"Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of\\n    Edom, you who dwell in the land of Uz.\" Jacob\\'s twin brother Esau founded a\\n    nation called Edom and Edom occupied an area SE to SW of the Dead Sea which\\n    was at least partly in the area of ancient Uz. In a similar way Moab and\\n    Ammon, the sons of Lot, established nations that occupied portions of\\n    ancient Uz on Israel\\'s eastern border. The only remaining portion of Uz not\\n    specifically occupied by a nation in Jeremiah\\'s day was the northeast\\n    border of Israel. Thus, the land of Uz in Job\\'s day occupied an area from\\n    northeast to south of the Israel of Jeremiah\\'s day. Job\\'s ranch could have\\n    been located anywhere within this large territory.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Outside of the book of Job, of all the biblical writers Jeremiah alone\\n    names ancient Uz as a land. For Jeremiah to think in terms of that area\\'s\\n    name found in just five words of previous Scripture [\"in the land of Uz\"]\\n    suggests the book of Job was a prominent source of his thinking about God.\\n    It would be a fascinating meditation for someone to dwell on how the book\\n    of Job contributed to Jeremiah\\'s faith.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Conclusion</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    In summary Job lived somewhere in Uz, somewhere east of Israel, somewhere\\n    that was vulnerable to the Sabeans of the desert and Chaldeans from some\\n    distant place, somewhere where his caravans could trade throughout Arabia,\\n    somewhere where he could have traveled to the Jordan River to see Behemoth,\\n    somewhere where lakes still froze fast, where hail and snow were common,\\n    and where windstorms might level the strongest houses.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Job lived in the transition from the Ice Age to the post Ice Age period,\\n    the subject of chapter 11. He lived before Arabia became unfarmable desert.\\n    Numerous indications point to an area northeast of Israel, somewhere in\\n    northern Jordan or northwest Arabia, several hundred miles east of the\\n    Mediterranean. As a descendant of Uz this was the portion of land he\\n    received and where he made his home in the waning centuries of the Ice Age.\\n</p>\\n<br clear=\"all\"/>\\n'},We={html:'<p align=\"center\">\\n    <strong>Chapter Ten</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p align=\"center\">\\n    <strong>Evidence from the Message of Job for Missing Generations</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    For a host of reasons some already stated in chapter nine, the Book of Job\\n    supports the view that Shem\\'s genealogy omits names. This chapter begins\\n    where God tells Job to recall his watching of the greatest land creature,\\n    the dinosaur Behemoth, in the Jordan Valley. That certainly happened many\\n    centuries before Abraham. But Behemoth was just one step in the goal of\\n    recording the book\\'s essential message for mankind.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    We are told in the opening two chapters of Job that Satan caused Job\\'s\\n    suffering. But far earlier, in the first chapter of the Bible we read\\n    without elaboration that God created the great sea monster and set him\\n    apart from all other animals. In Job 41 God finally elaborates on this king\\n    of pride who struck terror into the heart of man above all other creatures.\\n    By this we learn that God created him to picture the menace of Satan and\\n    for this elaborate warning to stand forever in the oldest book of the\\n    Bible.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    As to timing, Job himself was born eight or nine generations before Peleg,\\n    the fourth named generation of Shem\\'s descendants born after the Flood. Job\\n    lived in the waning years of the great Ice Age, long gone and forgotten by\\n    the days of the Patriarchs. In restoring Job who said God hated him, God\\n    spoke of His creation with more words than in Genesis. Why? Creation showed\\n    how good and kind God was to Job. With this matter settled God was free to\\n    reveal the real source of Job\\'s suffering by speaking of Leviathan, the\\n    divine picture of Satan.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Behemoth and Leviathan</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    For 44 verses in Job 40 and 41 our Creator speaks of the two enormous\\n    reptilian creatures mentioned above: Behemoth, a powerfully-built,\\n    long-tailed land creature and Leviathan, a vicious sea monster of\\n    tremendous strength that stood at the apex of the animal kingdom.\\n    Commentaries of the church fathers, those of the Reformation and even most\\n    today identify Behemoth as a hippopotamus or elephant and Leviathan as a\\n    sea crocodile or whale. After all, those were the largest land and sea\\n    creatures somewhat fitting God\\'s description that they knew. Not anymore.\\n    Today the world\\'s museums are stuffed with the fossilized bones of great\\n    land and sea creatures that were buried and preserved in the muds of the\\n    Great Flood. Sea creatures in the Flood\\'s cooler ocean regions and young\\n    dinosaurs on the Ark enabled both types to survive the Flood and grow in\\n    population until humans squeezed them out.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    But why speak to Job about these two impressive creatures when Job had\\n    wasted away to skin and bones, enduring the worst imaginable suffering for\\n    perhaps a year? Wouldn\\'t God comfort Job and explain his pain? In truth He\\n    did. The creation lecture showed that God was kind and good while those\\n    monsters pointed to the real cause of Job\\'s suffering. It did not come from\\n    God but from the evil personage the sea monster depicted-the leader of the\\n    fallen angels who desires to see every man share his misery in hell\\n    forever.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Bible commentators with their incorrect interpretations of Behemoth and\\n    Leviathan have muted Scripture\\'s purpose in exposing Satan\\'s sinister\\n    character and ignored God\\'s use of the analogy. This chapter presents four\\n    Hebrew nouns used in the Old Testament to represent this creature and the\\n    frightening character it was designed to portray. Then it will explore the\\n    angelic rebellion which required the creation of Leviathan. God\\'s exchange\\n    with Satan follows. All of this argues for many omitted names in Shem\\'s\\n    list.\\n</p>\\n<p align=\"center\">\\n    <strong>Four Hebrew Nouns for the Sea Monster</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Hebrew Noun #1-Tannin</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>\\n        So God created [<em>bar\\'ah</em>] great sea creatures [<em>tannin</em>].\\n        Genesis 1:21.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    God created the animal kingdom on days five and six of creation week. Of\\n    all those animals, He named only one-the great sea creature. The Hebrew\\n    word is <em>tannin</em>. Here the plural form of the noun is used,\\n    indicating God created many of them just as He caused the waters to swarm\\n    with fish (Genesis 1:20). The adjective <em>great</em> further\\n    distinguishes this creature from all others. It forms a Hebrew grammatical\\n    construction that emphasizes the adjective and can be rendered \"the sea\\n    creatures, the great ones.\"\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    To further focus on this creature, God placed him first in a new wave of\\n    divine creative activity. The Hebrew verb used here is <em>bar\\'ah</em>\\n    which specifically means \"to create.\" It is only found three times in the\\n    creation account. Otherwise, the two more general verbs, \"to make\" and \"to\\nform\" are used to describe God\\'s work of creation. The other two uses of    <em>bar\\'ah</em> are without question major acts of creation. It is used for\\n    the creation of the material universe in verse one and for the creation of\\n    man in verse 27.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Yet, here in verse 21 <em>bar\\'ah</em> is used for the creation of living\\n    things that had an immaterial component. Whereas plants created on day\\n    three have life, creatures created on days five and six of creation week\\n    have some kind of a mind or immaterial component and this higher level of\\n    life warranted the primary word for creating. The leading creature in this\\n    category was the great sea monster. A literal translation would read: \"And\\n    Elohim created the sea creatures, that is, the great ones.\" The NKJV and\\n    ESV render tannin \"sea creature\" here while the NASV uses \"sea monster.\"\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Certainly, the creation of creatures that could move was insignificant in\\n    comparison with the creation of the physical universe and man. Yet, here it\\n    stands-their creation set apart with the universe and man. Could it be that\\n    God used <em>bar\\'ah</em> specifically to raise questions about the only\\n    named creature in this category? Yet Genesis 1:21 provides no further\\n    details about him. In this way it seems that God established an open door\\n    to speak of him at a later time. At the end of creation week God saw all He\\n    made and it was very good; while enormous, the great sea creature was not\\n    menacing. The fall of man marred all of God\\'s creation and the sea creature\\n    became the most fearsome of animals.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nHebrew nouns often express characteristics of the thing they name.    <em>Tannin</em> literally means \"long-stretched\" and in its primary form,\\nthe three consonant verb form means \"to stretch.\"    <a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\" title=\"\"><sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup></a> It\\n    is found fifteen times in the Old Testament. Five times it is used for a\\n    snake (serpent). Aaron threw down his staff and it became a <em>tannin</em>\\n    . Deuteronomy 32:33 and Psalm 91:13 also use <em>tannin</em> in the sense\\n    of snake. Being a creature that appears to be stretched out because it is\\n    long and narrow, snakes were miniature versions of the great sea creature.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    In the psalmist\\' day, four hundred years after Moses compiled Genesis,\\n    Scripture repeats the creation pattern, using the sea creature to represent\\n    the animal kingdom. Psalm 148 is one of the \"Praise the LORD\" psalms. The\\n    first six verses call on angels, sun, moon and stars to praise the Lord.\\n    Verse seven turns to things on earth; the first thing mentioned is the sea\\n    creature (<em>tannin</em>). \"Praise the LORD from the earth, you great sea\\n    creatures [<em>tannin</em>, in the plural form] and all deeps\" Psalm 148:7.\\n    This verse would be referring to sea monsters as living marine creatures,\\n    not analogies to Satan, but it does show they still existed or were at\\n    least remembered even in the psalmist\\'s day.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The prophets used the sea creature to picture the two great nations that\\n    oppressed Israel. God addressed Pharaoh as a great dragon in Ezekiel 29:3:\\n\"Behold, I am against you, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great dragon [    <em>tannin</em>] that lies in the midst of his streams, that says, \\'My Nile\\n    is my own, I made it for myself.\\'\" Three chapters later God tells the\\n    prophet to \"say to Pharaoh King of Egypt: \\'You consider yourself a lion of\\n    the nations, but you are like a dragon [<em>tannin</em>] in the seas\\'\"\\n    Ezekiel 32:2. The lion was highly admired, considered the most regal of\\n    animals. Pharaoh represented himself that way. But God said in reality he\\n    was like the dragon (<em>tannin</em>). While <em>tannin</em> was famous and\\n    powerful, he was not considered noble. People dreaded the sea monster. He\\n    had a reputation for being dangerous, sinister and evil, certainly not the\\n    reputation Pharaoh sought.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Comparison with the sea monster was similarly used for Babylon:\\n    \"Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon has devoured me [Judah]&#8230; he has\\n    swallowed me like a monster [<em>tannin</em>] [swallows its victim]\"\\nJeremiah 51:34. Babylon had gobbled up Judah with the same ease that a    <em>tannin</em> gobbled up its victims.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Hebrew Noun #2-Leviathan (Job 41:1)</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    God chose the ordeal of Job to answer the many questions about the sea\\n    creature of Genesis 1:21. Job had charged that God was treating him\\n    unfairly, attacking him like an enemy. He demanded an audience with God so\\n    he could make his case. After Job\\'s three friends and a young theologian\\n    falsely accused him of grievous sins, God appeared in a powerful whirlwind\\n    which established a commanding presence. But He did not bring a crying\\n    towel, nor did He sympathize with Job or even mention Job\\'s suffering. Most\\n    importantly, He did not appear to be grilled by Job. Rather, He began: \"Who\\n    is this that darkens counsel by words without knowledge? Dress for action\\n    like a man; I will question you and you make it known to me\" (Job 38:2-3).\\n    It was Job who needed further enlightenment and not the other way around.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    So God would do the questioning and Job would do the answering. God\\'s\\n    subject was His creation which testified that He was good, that He\\n    sustained it, that He had filled man\\'s habitat with the fruit of His\\n    goodness and specifically that He had blessed Job through it. Therefore,\\n    God was not Job\\'s enemy and had not caused him to suffer. Job was\\n    speechless.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Two important truths need to be recognized at this point. The questions God\\n    asked were a universe beyond the learning of Job\\'s day which assures us\\n    that the Creator of the physical universe Himself was asking them. Answers\\n    to many of God\\'s scientific questions have only been learned in recent\\n    years; others still elude today\\'s most advanced science. Mankind did not\\n    have this knowledge 2550 years before Christ. If these questions had been\\n    composed by man as unbelievers charge, they would reflect the same bad\\n    science and even anti-science expressed in the writings of the ancients.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Also, we must recognize how pleased God was (and is) with the\\n    time-space-matter creation He made. God is more than boasting here, He is\\n    raving. If we ever wished to hear the Creator discuss His creation of the\\n    universe, the earth and living things at length, we have such a record\\n    right here in Job 38-41. These four chapters contain more than the entire\\n    book of Genesis or any other portion of Scripture on creation. Engineers\\n    know the difficulty of designing something that works correctly. God speaks\\n    of many inanimate and living things and they all work with breath-taking\\n    precision.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    So then, if God was not the source of Job\\'s suffering, what explained his\\n    ordeal? After questions about the physical and animal world, God spent the\\n    last 44 verses on the greatest land and sea creatures. Ten verses are\\n    devoted to Behemoth which by the testimony of God was the greatest land\\n    creature (Job 40:19)-a dinosaur with a long neck, long, powerful tail,\\n    bones like tubes of bronze and limbs like bars of iron (Job 40:18). All the\\n    land dinosaurs did not perish in the Flood. One pair of each kind was\\n    preserved on the Ark to repopulate the world after the Flood. Since many\\n    reptiles grow all their lives it would have been unnecessary to take full\\n    grown specimens on the Ark. God would have sent a young Behemoth pair. Over\\n    a millennium later Job watched these giant monsters in the Jordan Valley.\\n    While they were gone by the day of Abraham, they were still living in Job\\'s\\n    day.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>King over All the Sons of Pride. Job 41:1-34.</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Behemoth was not at the top of the monster ladder. God used him to lead up\\n    to the most awesome of them all, the great sea creature Leviathan (Job\\n    41:1). God devotes all 34 verses of Job 41 to this fearsome animal, the\\n    same number of verses found in the entire six-day creation account of\\n    Genesis 1:1-2:3. They speak of his exceeding danger to humans but it was up\\n    to Job to make the connection, that Leviathan represented the source of his\\n    grief.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    A Leviathan was almost impossible to kill. His size, armored exterior and\\n    ocean habitat gave him an enormous advantage over humans. By comparison man\\n    had limited maneuverability on or in the water. As to weapons at this time\\n    man was still limited to his own strength or those powered by his own\\n    strength such as spears and arrows which were useless against Leviathan.\\n    Thus, people lived in mortal fear of these creatures. Job knew what God was\\n    talking about. He had nearly lost his life in some unexplained encounter\\n    with a Leviathan:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>\\n        Lay your hands on him; remember the battle-you will not do it again!\\n        Job 41:8\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    From this we learn that Job traveled extensively because he would have to\\n    journey to one of the world\\'s oceans or large water bodies to have seen a\\n    Leviathan unless Lake Lisan was connected to the Red Sea and Leviathan\\n    occasionally ventured up river to this large inland lake. In verse after\\n    verse God describes the danger of trying to tangle with him (Job 41:7-10,\\n    25-29). He terrified people by rising high in the water, then crashing down\\n    with all his weight (Job 41:25) causing some commentators to conclude he\\n    was a whale. Many ancient seamen described his aggression, even attacking\\n    ocean-going vessels. Job said, \"Am I a sea monster [<em>tannin</em>] that\\n    you set a guard over me\" (Job 7:12)? Job felt God was watching him with the\\n    same intensity people set a guard to watch for the sea monster\\'s presence\\n    once one was spotted in their area.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    This second Hebrew word for the sea monster (<em>Leviathan</em>, always\\n    capitalized) is found six times in Scripture and is the one Hebrew word\\n    that only refers to this creature or the enemy he represented. The Hebrew\\n    stem in its various forms connotes a wreath which is something round and\\n    narrow; in the verb form, \"to twist, to surround;\" together <em>tannin</em>\\n    and <em>Leviathan</em> suggest the twisting motion of a crawling snake.\\n    Psalm 104:26 speaks of this serpent-like creature living in the open ocean:\\n    \"There go the ships and Leviathan, which you formed to play in it.\" Some\\n    have concluded that Leviathan was a salt water crocodile which is an\\n    exceptionally large species of crocodile. However, those crocodiles lived\\n    in bays and other shallow bodies of salt water. They did not play where\\n    ships sailed on the high seas; neither would they remain in plain sight\\n    when humans came along. Rather, they would slip away to hide under the\\n    water. On the other hand, Leviathan had no fear of humans so he did not\\n    hide when ships appeared. Most particularly, the sea crocodile was not the\\n    greatest of all creatures that ever lived as God says Leviathan was.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The cursing of the villagers at the arrival of a Leviathan was a fitting\\n    comparison to the intensity with which Job cursed the day of his birth.\\n    \"Let those curse it [the day of his birth] who curse the day [Leviathan\\n    arrived in their bay], who are ready to rouse up Leviathan\" (Job 3:8).\\n    Their children would not be safe on the shore or in the water with\\n    Leviathan around so they had to drive him out of their bay or lagoon or\\n    move somewhere else until he left. But they cursed that day because in\\n    rousing up Leviathan, some would be injured, some might die in the battle\\n    and all would be terrified.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    You might wonder if the sea creature (<em>tannin</em>) of Genesis one is\\n    the same as Leviathan of Job 41. A complete word study makes this obvious\\n    but Psalm 74:13-14 provides a quick answer by using the two words\\n    synonymously. It is referring to the Red Sea event: \"You [God] divided the\\n    sea by your might; you broke the heads of the <strong>sea monsters</strong>\\n[<em>tannin</em>] on the waters. You crushed the heads of    <strong>Leviathan</strong>; you gave him as food for the creatures of the\\n    wilderness.\" God parted the sea for Israel to pass, and then returned the\\n    waters to drown Pharaoh\\'s charioteers. The bodies of soldiers and horses\\n    washed up on the shore where carrion eating creatures of the desert\\n    consumed them. There were no actual sea monsters in this event but both the\\n    words for sea monster and Leviathan are used for the same purpose, as\\n    analogies to describe just how frightening and lethal Pharaoh\\'s chariot\\n    army was.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Although ancient writings, including Ugarit (Babylonian) and Canaanite\\n    literature, give this creature mythical qualities, long before the\\n    distortions, on day five of creation week God created a real creature that\\n    was at the top of the animal world, the greatest of all His living earthly\\n    creatures. God concluded His words about Leviathan with that very picture.\\n    \"On earth there is not his like [equal], a creature without fear. He sees\\n    everything that is high; he is king over all the sons of pride\" (Job\\n    41:33-34). Beyond question this creature was a real animal and well known\\n    to Job and the people of his day.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Hebrew Nouns #3 and #4-Nachash and Rahab</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Besides <em>tannin</em> (Genesis 1:21) and Leviathan (Job 41:1) two other\\n    Hebrew nouns (<em>nachash</em> and <em>rahab</em>) are used for this\\n    creature. <em>Nachash</em> is the primary Hebrew word for snake. It is\\n    found in Genesis three where Satan used a snake to speak to Eve and trick\\n    her into eating of the forbidden tree. It appears in Numbers 21 where\\n    poisonous snakes bit the people and they died. God reversed their lethal\\n    bites by having Moses fashion a bronze snake and mount it on a pole. By\\n    looking on the bronze snake whoever was dying from a snake bite would live.\\n    A derivative of this word is the Hebrew word for copper and bronze. Many\\n    snakes have the glistening brown color of these metals. Various evil\\n    connotations arose from the shape and motion of the snake. A verb form of\\n    this word is used ten times in the Old Testament for practicing divination.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Because of its long, narrow shape and twisting motion, <em>nachash</em> was\\n    used twice for the sea creature. \"If they [the wicked] hide from my sight\\nat the bottom of the sea, there I will command the [sea] serpent [    <em>nachash</em>], and it shall bite them\" (Amos 9:3). Amos had previously\\n    spoken of digging into Sheol or climbing to heaven to flee from God, so he\\n    was not talking about the bottom of a shallow bay. He was talking about the\\n    bottom of the ocean, far below the diving capacity of the sea crocodile.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Job talked about the power of God in chapter twenty-six. God stilled the\\nsea and by His wind cleared the sky. He pierced the fleeing serpent (    <em>nachash</em>) and shattered Rahab (the fourth Hebrew word for the sea\\n    monster) (Job 26:12-13). \"Rahab\" is always used as a proper noun in the Old\\n    Testament but its various Hebrew forms convey a very specific meaning. The\\n    masculine noun meant \"storm, arrogance.\" As an adjective it meant \"proud,\\n    defiant.\" The verb form meant \"to act stormily, boisterously, arrogantly.\"\\n    Years later the harlot of Jericho who hid the two Hebrew spies received\\n    this name. Rahab must have been a very assertive person even in her\\n    mother\\'s womb. The word \"Rahab\" is also used six times in Scripture for\\n    what the sea monster represented-those who act defiantly against God and\\n    His chosen people Israel. Four times it specifically refers to Egypt which\\n    enslaved God\\'s chosen people. Their ways are likened to those of the sea\\n    monster.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Besides Job 26:12-13 several other passages use two or more of these words\\n    together, showing they were synonymous. In Isaiah 51:9 Rahab and the sea\\n    creature (<em>tannin</em>) are used synonymously: \"Was it not you [the\\n    LORD] who cut Rahab in pieces, who pierced the dragon [<em>tannin</em>]?\\n    Was it not you who dried up the sea, the waters of the great deep, who made\\n    the depths of the sea a way for the redeemed to pass over?\"\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Isaiah is speaking of Israel crossing the Red Sea while Pharaoh\\'s pursuing\\n    army was lost in the sea. In his arrogance and defiance of God\\'s will\\n    (Rahab-like characteristics), Pharaoh came with the might of a sea serpent\\n    (<em>tannin</em>), but God easily pierced him and cut his army to pieces.\\n    While <em>tannin</em>, <em>nachash</em> and Rahab had other uses, they\\n    together with \"Leviathan\" are used in the Old Testament about twenty-five\\n    times to develop an awareness of this intensely evil spiritual being God\\n    wanted to warn man about.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    As revelation progressed God gave man more and more details about the\\n    dangerous enemy Leviathan represented. Finally, Revelation 12:7-9 and\\n    20:1-3 clearly refer to him as the great dragon, the ancient serpent, the\\n    devil and Satan and relate how God removes him in stages. Meanwhile, God\\n    has provided armor to protect the believer from the cosmic powers Satan\\n    commands but this armor must be appropriated.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>\\n        And the great dragon was thrown down, that ancient serpent, who is\\n        called the devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world-he was\\n        thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him.\\n        Revelation 12:9.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>\\n        <sup>10</sup>\\nFinally, be strong in the Lord and in the strength of his might.        <sup>11</sup>Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to\\n        stand against the schemes of the devil. <sup>12</sup>For we do not\\n        wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the\\n        authorities, against the cosmic powers over this present darkness,\\n        against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places. Ephesians\\n        6:10-12.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Thus, God had a very special purpose for fixing this animal in people\\'s\\n    minds. He designed this creature to represent the leader of the angelic\\n    rebellion. As the most vicious and dangerous creature known to man, it\\n    portrayed how harmful Satan is. In common speech it became a measure for\\n    the worst that man could imagine. Satan is \"our ancient foe who seeks to\\n    work us woe.\" But while Leviathan was the worst creature a person could\\n    encounter, he was no match for God. The implication is that when Job didn\\'t\\n    understand what was happening, he should have trusted God who has the\\n    greatest power-who is omnipotent. So the first chapter in the Bible singles\\n    out this creature and the oldest book in the Bible goes into incredible\\n    detail as God Himself discusses its power and ability to harm.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Creation of Angels and Need for Leviathan</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Long before this space-time-matter continuum God created a vast population\\n    of spirits in His image. Because man was created a little lower than the\\n    angels (Psalm 8:5; Hebrews 2:7), we can only imagine their fine minds,\\n    great strength, powerful wills, beautiful worship and bonding friendships.\\n    Did they all know each other&#8230; a billion or one hundred billion?\\n    Apparently they had the opportunity and the capacity. But they were not all\\n    similarly gifted. Some had greater capabilities and higher positions as\\n    they functioned in their divinely appointed duties. Then one became lifted\\n    up with pride. Ezekiel 28:12-19, a prophecy with both an immediate and more\\n    distant application, tells what happened. This evil one set himself against\\n    God. Even worse he exalted himself and thought in his heart, \"I will set my\\n    throne on high&#8230;I will make myself like the Most High\" (Isaiah\\n    14:13-14). He eventually persuaded a full third of the angelic population\\n    to support him in his quest to sit on God\\'s throne (Revelation 12:4).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    God loved each of the angels He created. With sorrow He exercised judgment.\\n    To our limited thinking the sentence was unbelievably harsh-incarceration\\n    in the eternal fire (Matthew 26:41) especially prepared for these fallen\\n    angels. Yet, while God\\'s sentence on Satan and his followers was pronounced\\n    in eternity past, it is still to be executed. Instead, God created the\\n    universe and man.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    God marked the leader of these rebels with the name \"Satan\" which means\\n    adversary. All would know that there were just two camps-God with His\\n    forces and the adversary with his; good and evil; light and darkness. To\\n    this day the adversary and his minions have limited freedom to oppose God\\'s\\n    work (James 4:7; I Peter 5:8). Somehow the creation of man is a part of\\n    God\\'s ultimate dealing with Satan. Since Satan can\\'t touch God he seeks to\\n    harm this instrument of God that somehow is God\\'s tool to execute the\\n    sentence pronounced long ago-hence, Leviathan. The book of Job brings this\\n    out more than any other Scripture.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Some maintain that God created the angels as well as man during creation\\n    week and that Satan fell with a third of heaven\\'s population a short time\\n    later. Creating angels and man at the same time confuses the immaterial\\n    with the material. The space-time-matter creation of Genesis one was\\n    physical and material. Angels like God are immaterial, not physical and\\n    therefore not a part of God\\'s physical creation. God not only created\\n    angels before the time that is measured in the physical universe but He and\\n    His angels shared much activity. Each of the angels had his place. Each\\n    learned to function in an orderly way. Each learned how to exalt God\\'s\\n    throne. If a comparison could be made to the human time-frame, it seems\\n    that far more time went by when God and His angels enjoyed each other than\\n    has gone on since God created Adam.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Satan\\'s fall after the creation of man introduces the bizarre situation of\\n    1/3<sup>rd</sup> of heaven\\'s population being consigned to hell just years\\n    after God created them. No. The heavenly population surrounded God for a\\n    vast time in eternity past learning their duties and perfecting their\\n    worship before pride led Satan to gather a vast following to challenge God\\n    and eventually be put on trial by God and sentenced to the lake of fire.\\n    The whole idea comes from an over-literal reading of Genesis 1:31 which\\n    says \"God saw everything that he had made, and behold, it was very good.\"\\n    Unfortunately, \"everything\" is understood to be everything God ever made\\n    rather than the subject of Genesis one which is the creation of all things\\n    subject to the physical realm.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Satan\\'s First Attack on Mankind</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    In the preceding chapter we saw the consistent life of faith of the one God\\n    chose to expose Satan\\'s twisted thinking about the Creator and his intense\\n    hatred for mankind. After just those opening five verses, we entered the\\n    very presence of God. The veil that separates the physical universe from\\n    the highest heaven, the spiritual heaven of God\\'s abode, was parted briefly\\n    that we might learn of a conflict between God and the fallen angels and be\\n    alerted to the mortal danger in which it places mankind.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    When God created Adam, He established one prohibition: \"You may surely eat\\n    of every tree of the garden, but of the tree of the knowledge of good and\\n    evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely\\n    die.\" (Genesis 2:16-17) At a later time the Tempter came and persuaded Eve\\n    to eat from the forbidden tree. He must have swelled with glee and settled\\n    back to watch the man and woman die. He thought he had thwarted God\\'s plan\\n    before it even started. But God had far more in mind-a masterful plan to\\n    overcome man\\'s disobedience and provide hope and respite despite oceans of\\n    suffering caused by Satan.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    As God warned, when man broke the only prohibition He had given him, he did\\n    die. He died spiritually. This spiritual death was an immediate break in\\n    the bond between God and man, an alienation, an invisible barrier that\\n    caused man to hide from God. Further, Adam\\'s disobedience triggered the\\n    principle of entropy (progressive disorder/breaking down) throughout the\\n    entire physical creation. It all began to go downhill. Further, man began\\n    to die physically, a process that took some 900 years in Adam\\'s case. Along\\n    the way suffering was inherent.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Here now in Job, the oldest book of the Bible, God reveals this conflict\\n    more fully than in all the rest of Scripture. He demonstrated early how\\n    sinister, how cruel, how powerful, how hateful that adversary is towards\\n    his Maker and therefore toward man whom God created to share His heaven. In\\n    Job God is delivering a message to the world of mankind He loves: \"Be\\n    warned. There is an adversary who works with all his cunning during your\\n    entire lifetime to ruin you. He is trying to poison your soul just like he\\n    poisoned his own soul and the souls of those who joined him. Only I and My\\n    salvation can deliver you from the adversary\\'s doom and destruction in\\n    eternal fire.\"\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    As Job opens, we enter the very presence of God on \"a day when the sons of\\n    God came to present themselves before the LORD and Satan also came among\\n    them\" (Job 1:6). Those who gathered were called \"the sons of God.\" Of all\\n    humans only Adam and Eve were directly created by God and thus can properly\\n    be called \"the sons of God\" in that special sense. However, all the angels\\n    were directly created by God. Thus, they bear the title, \"Sons of God.\"\\n    Here God is conducting a mandatory assembly of all His angelic sons, both\\n    the holy and the fallen.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>The Questioning of Satan</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    In front of the entire angelic population God initiated a conversation with\\n    Satan. In doing so He would give the angels another lesson in the wisdom of\\n    His ways. \"Have you considered my servant Job, that there is none like him\\n    on the earth, a blameless and upright man, who fears God and turns away\\n    from evil?\" (Job 1:8) What a contrast. Job diligently honored God, living\\n    in the light of all God had revealed by his day. Satan was the opposite, a\\n    total rebel. The trap was bated. Satan took it-hook, line and sinker, so to\\n    speak:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>\\n        <sup>9</sup>\\n        Does Job fear God for no reason? <sup>10</sup>Have you not put a hedge\\n        around him and his house and all that he has on every side? You have\\n        blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in\\n        the land. <sup>11</sup>But stretch out your hand and touch all that he\\n        has and he will curse you to your face. Job 1:9-11.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    God provided salvation for man immediately after the Fall by teaching the\\n    first parents to offer animal sacrifice, an exercise which unknowingly\\n    embraced God\\'s lamb to come. Man could not earn salvation; he did not\\n    deserve salvation; God provided it in grace. Satan slammed God\\'s plan of\\n    grace, dismissing God\\'s salvation for man as a sham. Evil said light was\\n    darkness and darkness was light. \"Just remove your hedge and then you will\\n    see his true colors,\" challenged the Destroyer.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    In effect Satan charged that Job feared God because it paid, that God\\n    bought His worshipers, and that Job didn\\'t truly love God. His worship was\\n    motivated by self-interest. Job was a hypocrite. Beyond this Satan was\\n    saying that God\\'s salvation for mankind doesn\\'t work, that His plan to\\n    provide redemption to those who were born spiritually dead due to Adam\\'s\\n    disobedience was a hoax. Further, Satan expressed his disdain and sneering\\n    contempt for God not in private but before the entire population of heaven.\\n    The hosts of heaven held their collective breathes. How would God reply?\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    [To pause and wonder: all of this at the beginning of the oldest book of\\n    the Bible. What a disclosure of high priority in God\\'s mind.]\\n</p>\\n<p align=\"center\">\\n    <strong>The Attacks of Satan on Job</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>First Attack: Destruction of Job\\'s Possessions</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Before that angelic assembly God as much as declared \"Let the contest\\n    begin. We will test your [Satan\\'s] contention. We will see if Job is a\\n    phony or not.\" Here were the rules: \"All he has is in your hand. Only\\n    against him do not stretch out your hand\" (Job 1:12). With that Satan\\n    rushed out to orchestrate the senseless destruction of all Job had.\\n    Messengers arrived one after another from distant parts of the ranch to\\n    report 500 yoke of oxen, 500 donkeys, 7000 sheep, 3000 camels, the keepers\\n    and Job\\'s ten children-all gone. What a show of power and hate.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Satan brought the Sabeans of the desert to plunder the oxen and donkeys and\\n    murder or kidnap Job\\'s servants with them. In a distant region he caused\\n    some sort of natural disaster, possibly a lightning storm or pyroclastic\\n    flow from an active volcano, to destroy the sheep and their keepers. From\\n    beyond the desert he brought the Chaldeans for the camels. He caused a\\n    freak tornado to come from the wilderness and strike exactly when Job\\'s\\n    children were celebrating on the day of his firstborn. This mayhem would\\n    stand for all time as a grave illustration of Satan\\'s power on planet\\n    earth.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    All heaven watched to see what Job would do next. Here is what they saw and\\n    heard: <sup>20</sup>\"Then Job arose and tore his robe and shaved his head\\n    and fell on the ground and worshiped. <sup>21</sup>And he said, \\'Naked I\\n    came from my mother\\'s womb, and naked shall I return. The LORD gave, and\\n    the LORD has taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD\\'\" (Job 1:20-21).\\n    Next, we are given the divine commentary on Job\\'s response. \"In all this\\n    Job did not sin or charge God with wrong\" Job 1:22. The Adversary had been\\n    wrong. Instead of cursing, Job did just the opposite, he blessed the LORD.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Second Attack: Destruction of Job\\'s Health</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Destruction and death had come in Satan\\'s first attack. Job lost not only\\n    family but longtime, trusted servants. In the following months with heavy\\n    heart he cared for widows and orphans as he began rebuilding his ranch.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Sometime later the Sons of God were again summoned to assemble before their\\n    Father. Again the Adversary was singled out. God pointed out that Job\\n    \"holds fast his integrity, although you incited me against him to destroy\\n    him without reason\" (Job 2:3). God actually said that He destroyed Job\\n    without reason. Satan did not govern creation. God alone rules. God is\\n    sovereign. No event happens without His permission.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The Accuser did not admit that he had accused Job falsely. He had taken a\\n    chance. Maybe Job would crack. But the mental anguish and sense of\\n    abandonment by God he caused hadn\\'t worked. Satan proposed to change the\\n    rules of the game.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>\\n        <sup>4</sup>\\n\"Skin for skin! All that a man has he will give for his life.        <sup>5</sup>But stretch out your hand and touch his bone and his flesh,\\n        and he will curse you to your face.\" <sup>6</sup>And the LORD said to\\n        Satan, \"Behold, he is in your hand; only spare his life.\" Job 2:4-6.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    This time Satan would resort to pain, the most intense he could inflict. No\\n    need to orchestrate Sabeans, Chaldeans, hails of fire and destructive wind.\\n    Satan made a beeline for Job\\'s ranch in the land of Uz. But he had to be\\n    careful here. His attack must not be lethal or the contest would\\n    immediately be over. In fact God had specifically commanded Satan not to\\n    take Job\\'s life and Satan dared not defy God in the face of a direct\\n    command. Satan \"went out from the presence of the LORD and struck Job with\\n    loathsome sores from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head\" (Job\\n    2:7).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Now Job couldn\\'t even work. He was in constant pain. In time he lost weight\\n    to the point where his bones showed. His skin turned black. The malady\\n    changed his appearance beyond recognition. It was visible for all to see\\n    and considered a sign of God\\'s disapproval. People turned against him. Even\\n    the most despicable showed their contempt by spitting on or at him.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Under the duress of pain people say things they would not otherwise say.\\n    God knew Job\\'s worship was truly motivated by love for Him, not material\\n    blessing. But the hosts of heaven, not even the Adversary with all his\\n    great power, could see Job\\'s heart. This contest was for their sake, not\\n    God\\'s. As for God, He previously received Job\\'s worship and was exalted by\\n    it. Now He was exalted by Job\\'s steadfastness while under intense\\n    suffering. Through months of physical pain Job did not curse God. Then it\\n    was time to conclude the contest. All heaven watched to see how God would\\n    end it and restore Job.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Surprises never cease. God, of course, knew exactly what He would do. He\\n    would use this opportunity to give mankind an answer for undeserved\\n    suffering, the message for which the Book of Job is most remembered. But to\\n    get it all out, the angels as well as future generations of mankind would\\n    have to know what was going on inside Job, what was going through his mind,\\n    what was in his soul. Thus God moved three of Job\\'s longtime friends,\\n    possibly noted regional theological authorities like Job to make \"an\\n    appointment to come to show him sympathy and comfort him\" (Job 2:11). They\\n    would end up having an all-day debate with him and in all these words\\n    everyone would come to know what Job was thinking.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Finding Henry Morris\\' Book on Job</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Now I must become personal. The reason will soon be evident. I certainly\\n    was fully committed to biblical inerrancy after two years at Multnomah\\n    School of the Bible (now Multnomah University) in Portland Oregon. After\\n    completing my undergraduate work at Wheaton College, my four years at\\n    Dallas Theological Seminary cemented my inerrancy conviction. When I\\n    abandoned the gap theory through the teaching of Dr. Henry Morris II, 30\\n    years later, I entered the world of creation science-evidences for a young\\n    earth.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    As my wife and I founded the Mount St. Helens 7Wonders Creation Museum in\\n    1998, one of the early books we ordered for the new bookstore was Morris\\'\\n    book on Job. I was so impressed with it that over the next three years we\\n    sold about 70 copies which may have made it our top selling book. In my\\n    hands is my original copy with underlining and highlighting on nearly every\\n    page. In November of 2000 I wrote that I had begun \"a careful study of the\\n    book.\" This would have been my second or third reading. In time you might\\n    say that of all the 66 books in the Bible, Morris\\' book caused me to\\n    specialize in the Book of Job. Now sixty-five years of biblical study\\n    skills have been poured into Job.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Morris showed that the purpose of Job was not undeserved suffering as most\\n    expositors taught; but as Dr. Harold Wilmington explained in the Foreword,\\n    Morris felt it demonstrated God\\'s sovereignty to the heavenly population\\nand reemphasized the importance of God\\'s original creation.    <a href=\"#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\" title=\"\"><sup><sup>[2]</sup></sup></a>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Parents prioritize the training of their children. Some lessons are more\\n    basic than others and must be taught early on. Such is the Book of Job\\n    where God graphically presents three foundational truths for understanding\\n    His heart and making sense of our existence. While each lesson reinforces\\n    the other two, here is how these lessons become obvious:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Lesson one. </strong>\\n    God is resolving the discord in heaven caused by the rebellious angels who\\n    challenged His government. This discord is obvious through God\\'s exchange\\n    with Satan (Job 1-2) and His analogy to Satan through Leviathan. It leads\\n    to the second lesson which addresses suffering.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Lesson two. </strong>\\n    Man is the innocent victim of this angelic warfare. He tries to make sense\\n    of the suffering it causes, reasoning that God has the power to prevent or\\n    remove it. But by leaving the fallen angels out of the equation, he ends up\\n    with the conclusion that somehow God is to blame for suffering. In doing so\\n    man overlooks the fact that all suffering is produced either directly or\\n    indirectly by those rebels. The dialogues of Job and his friends picture\\n    how mankind struggles with this issue.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Lesson three</strong>\\n    . The physical creation is an exquisite and complex game board designed by\\n    God on which this conflict is played out. That God not only designed but\\n    also maintains it is sufficient evidence for mankind to trust Him\\n    completely in what man cannot understand. God provides this lesson in his\\n    discourse on creation in Job 38-40.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The theological confusion of Job and his friends along with God\\'s\\n    examination comprises the book\\'s celebrated poetic content, thirty-nine\\n    chapters which focus on Job\\'s plight (Job 3-41). First, the acrimonious\\n    discussion of Job and his friends. Then arrogant Elihu who falsely claimed\\n    God had given him a message for Job. Finally, God came and restored Job.\\n    This day was also Satan\\'s final chance to so provoke Job that he would\\n    curse God. Yet when the day was over, Job\\'s confidence in God was fully\\n    restored.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Job\\'s friends knew much of the ways of God, but there was this great gap in\\n    their theology-believing that all human suffering was the result of\\n    personal sin. Purely cause and effect. When one committed sin, God was\\n    obligated to punish. In this case they were convinced Job had committed\\n    some awful sin and they continued that vein until God appeared. Eight times\\n    they stated their position with different arguments and eight times Job\\n    answered. Job had defended his innocence, but in the process began to\\n    question God and even condemn God. Then a fourth person angrily pounced on\\n    Job for his words about his innocence and God\\'s unfairness but basically\\n    his solution for Job\\'s suffering was no different than that of the others.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Suddenly God appeared, challenged Job to listen carefully and proceeded to\\n    ask precise questions about major areas of creation. Here He says more\\n    about His creation than in Genesis or any other book of the Bible. He also\\n    speaks more personally about it with chapters of profound questions. Some\\n    still cannot be answered by the world of science. Only the Creator Himself\\n    could have such intimate knowledge of the universe and its operation. Job\\n    had thought God didn\\'t care, wasn\\'t paying attention. These questions\\n    caused Job to realize that God actively and continuously sustains all\\n    creation so God was not absent or silent but was actively and daily caring\\n    for Job. Job\\'s heart was thrilled. His Old Friend was back.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Creation is the most basic argument in proclaiming God\\'s love and concern\\n    for mankind. It sets Him apart from all impostors. When it comes to\\n    alternatives, how could one not choose the Creator as opposed to the\\n    adversary in any of his many costumes? Resolving this heavenly conflict,\\n    recognizing its hurtful effects on humanity and God\\'s provision of the\\n    physical universe summarizes the message of Job, three subjects of\\n    earth-shaking proportions all rolled into one comprehensive whole, but so\\n    novel in part to standard Christian thought that certain details must be\\n    carefully examined.\\n</p>\\n<p align=\"center\">\\n    <strong>Miserable Comforters: A Further Attack by Satan</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nJob\\'s three friends arrived to find his situation so appalling that    <sup>12</sup>\"they raised their voices and wept, and they tore their robes\\n    and sprinkled dust on their heads toward heaven. <sup>13</sup>And they sat\\n    with him on the ground seven days and seven nights, and no one spoke a word\\n    to him, for they saw that his suffering was very great\" (Job 2:12-13).\\n    Finally, Job broke the silence as he lamented that the pain was so intense\\n    that its only escape was never having been born in the first place.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The next chapters (chapters 4-31) contain three cycles of speeches. Rather\\n    than provide sympathy, the three friends tried to solve the dilemma of\\n    Job\\'s great loss. Obviously it was more than coincidence. First Eliphaz\\n    spoke and Job answered. Then Bildad gave his ideas and Job countered.\\n    Lastly Zophar counseled and Job replied. The first cycle is found in\\n    chapters 4-14. Eliphaz had an entire week to consider the possibilities and\\n    then he shared his wisdom. \"As I have seen, those who plow iniquity and sow\\n    trouble reap the same\" (Job 4:8). For two chapters (4-5) Eliphaz developed\\n    the idea that Job had lived a life of iniquity. Now God was punishing him.\\n    Here was what Job must do. \"As for me, I would seek God, and to God would I\\n    commit my cause\" (Job 5:8). Job gave a lengthy reply in chapters six and\\n    seven to the effect that such advice was not helpful, even cynical because\\n    \"I have not denied the words of the Holy One\" (Job 6:10). Still, he\\n    implored his friends to provide an answer. \"Teach me, and I will be silent;\\n    make me understand how I have gone astray\" (Job 6:24).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBildad weighed in with \"Can reeds flourish where there is no water?    <sup>13</sup>Such are the paths of all who forget God; the hope of the\\n    godless shall perish\" (Job 8:11, 13). He affirmed Eliphaz\\'s solution with\\n    \"Behold, God will not reject a blameless man, nor take the hand of\\n    evildoers\" (Job 8:20). Job replied at length in chapters nine and ten,\\n    first agreeing with Bildad, \"Truly I know that it is so\" (Job 9:2), then\\n    wondering how anyone could be blameless and finally coming up with the\\n    opposite answer. <sup>21</sup>\"I am blameless; <sup>22</sup>therefore I\\n    say, He destroys both the blameless and the wicked\" (Job 9:21, 22).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    That really got Zophar\\'s goat. It was his turn and he was livid. He viewed\\n    Job as stubborn and harangued him unmercifully with statements like \"Should\\n    a man full of talk be judged right\" (Job 11:2)? He grouped Job with\\n    \"worthless men\" (Job 11:11). His next insult rated five stars. \"But a\\n    stupid man will get understanding when a wild donkey\\'s colt is born a man\"\\n    (Job 11:12). Donkeys never give birth to people so Zophar views Job\\'s\\n    thinking as hopelessly stupid. His solution was the same as the others, \"If\\n    iniquity is in your hand, put it far away\" (Job 11:14). So far it is hard\\n    to detect sympathy or comfort.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Zophar rang Job\\'s bell. Following his friends\\' first three speeches, Job\\n    began a three-chapter rebuttal with this epic retort, \"No doubt you are the\\n    people and wisdom will die with you\" (Job 12:2). Stedman paraphrases Job\\'s\\n    put down like this: \"You\\'ve got all the answers, you\\'ve solved all the\\nproblems, you know everything.\"    <a href=\"#_ftn3\" name=\"_ftnref3\" title=\"\"><sup><sup>[3]</sup></sup></a> The\\n    more they pushed, the more Job pushed back. In the process he said worse\\n    and worse things about God. He insisted repeatedly that God was treating\\n    him unjustly. \"I want to argue my ways to His face\" (Job 13:15). Later he\\n    asked, \"Why do you [God] count me as your enemy\" (Job 13:24)? \"You put my\\n    feet in the stocks\" (Job 13:27). \"You destroy the hope of man\" (Job 14:19).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The second round of speeches (chapters 15-21) grew in unkindness and\\n    hardened positions. The third round (chapters 22-31) included baseless\\n    charges of specific sins (Job 22:6-9). Eliphaz and Bildad said hateful\\n    things while Zophar gave up. Meanwhile Job had more and more to say in his\\n    defense. The two sides couldn\\'t be further apart. Their friendship appeared\\n    broken beyond repair.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Insights into Job\\'s Responses</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    As his friends pushed him to the wall, pressing their assault, Job said\\n    more alarming things about God, words for which he would later repent. \"He\\n    has torn me in his wrath and hated me\" (Job 16:9). \"My spirit is broken\"\\n    (Job 17:1). \"He has made me a byword of the peoples\" (Job 17:6). \"God has\\n    put me in the wrong\" (Job 19:6). \"He has kindled his wrath against me and\\n    counts me as his adversary\" (Job 19:11). Speaking directly to God, Job\\n    said, \"You have turned cruel to me; with the might of your hand, you\\n    persecute me\" (Job 30:21). Finally, Job defiantly demanded an affidavit of\\n    charges from God and stated that he would stand before God as a prince and\\n    defend himself (Job 31:35-37).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    On the other hand, his words revealed a remarkable life of faith. \"I have\\n    not denied the words of the Holy One\" (Job 6:10). \"I who called to God and\\n    he answered me, a just and blameless man, am a laughing stock\" (Job 12:4).\\n    \"Though he slay me, I will hope in him\" (Job 13:15). \"For I know that my\\n    Redeemer lives&#8230;in my flesh I shall see God\" (Job 19:25-26). \"My foot\\n    has held fast to his steps, I have kept his way&#8230;I have not departed\\n    from the commandments of his lips; I have treasured the words of his mouth\\n    more than my portion of food\" (Job 23:11-12). <sup>2</sup>\"Oh, that I were\\nas in the months of old, as in the days when God watched over me,    <sup>3</sup>when his lamp shone upon my head, and by his light I walked\\n    through the darkness, <sup>4</sup>as I was in my prime, when the friendship\\n    of God was upon my tent, <sup>5</sup>when the Almighty was yet with me\"\\n    (Job 29:2-5).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Here, approximately midway between creation and Christ, God\\'s words were\\n    available, His commandments known, man recognized His light. Further, man\\n    called on God and God answered him. Therefore, man knew God watched over\\n    him, had hope in a living redeemer, walked with God, sensed God\\'s\\n    friendship and lived in the expectancy of ultimately seeing God in his\\n    flesh. These words testify to a just God who in every age provides\\n    knowledge of Himself to those who seek that knowledge. Job spoke of himself\\n    as \"just and blameless.\" He had lived up to all the light God had given.\\n    God had revealed that He would bless those who so lived. For this reason,\\n    Job was so confused, so bewildered, so brokenhearted.\\n</p>\\n<p align=\"center\">\\n    <strong>Elihu: Satan\\'s Final Attack</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    After Job\\'s friends spoke, an angry individual named Elihu demanded a\\n    hearing. This individual was not a peer of the four. Being young he had no\\n    choice but to wait until the others had finished. Then he unloaded for six\\n    chapters (Job 32-37) saying more than the entire books of I-III John. He\\n    took an entire chapter just to dogmatically state that he had the answer\\n    (chapter 32). He speaks even more vilely of Job than the three. If Satan\\n    were using them to destroy Job, how much more this man? Fortunately, Job\\n    did not reply. Either he was too exhausted or more likely, God broke in\\n    before Job could say something even more regrettable.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Elihu\\'s demeanor was so disgustingly arrogant one might be tempted to\\n    associate him with Nimrod, but no one can prove this link for sure. Elihu\\n    was a Buzite of the family of Ram. Ham\\'s oldest son Cush had a son named\\n    Raamah (Ram). Raamah fathered Sheba and Dedan. Since these people groups\\n    are mentioned in the discourses of Job, they could have had a son named Buz\\n    from whom Elihu came. The most notorious of Cush\\'s sons was evil Nimrod\\n    (Genesis 10:6-8). While Elihu\\'s actions point to such an association, we\\n    have previously observed that the same names occur again and again in the\\n    Old Testament so one must be very cautious about identifying a certain\\n    individual or place with one previously mentioned.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Deviously Elihu said that Job was wrong about God not speaking (Job\\n    33:14ff). He claimed that God spoke in dreams but man (Job) didn\\'t listen.\\n    God also spoke through pain. Further, God sent mediators or angels (Elihu\\n    is referring to himself) \"to declare to man [the sinner] what is right for\\n    him\" (Job 33:23). This angel (the one with an answer from God) says to the\\n    sinner, \"I have found a ransom\" (Job 33:24). The ransom is what the sinner\\n    must do to be restored. In this way Elihu was claiming to have a direct\\n    message from God which was false.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Then Elihu proceeded to describe how the sinner (Job) should embrace the\\n    ransom (ie, Elihu\\'s solution) by abandoning his great wickedness which\\n    Elihu spells out in the next chapters.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>\\n        <sup>26</sup>\\n        Then man prays to God, and he [God] accepts him; he [the repentant\\n        sinner] sees his face [sees God\\'s face] with a shout of joy, and he\\n        [God] restores to man [to the sinner] his righteousness. <sup>27</sup>\\n        He [the sinner] sings before men and says: \"I sinned and perverted what\\n        was right, and it was not repaid to me. <sup>28</sup>He [God] has\\n        redeemed my soul from going down to the pit, and my life shall look\\n        upon the light.\" Job 33:26-28.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    In chapter 34 Elihu continued at length on how God sees all man\\'s steps,\\n    particularly Job\\'s, so \"there is no gloom or deep darkness where evildoers\\n    may hide themselves\" Job 34:21-22. God calls them \"worthless,\" \"wicked,\"\\n    and He \"shows no partiality,\" \"shatters the mighty without investigation,\"\\n    \"overturns them in the night and they are crushed,\" \"strikes them for their\\n    wickedness&#8230; because they turned aside from following him.\" \"They\\n    caused the cry of the poor to come to Him\" (Job 34:18-19, 23-25, 27-28). He\\nwishes that Job were \"tried to the end, because he answers like wicked men,    <sup>37</sup>for he adds rebellion to his sin\" (Job 34:36-37). To Elihu Job\\n    has acted so wickedly that God should punish him even more severely.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    In view of his litany of Job\\'s sins and Job\\'s terrible suffering because of\\n    them, it is hard to deny that Elihu actually held the same position as the\\n    first three, that Job\\'s sins had resulted in God\\'s judgment. Yet Scripture\\n    already told us that Job\\'s loss of possessions and health was not over\\n    sinfulness but due to an unseen contest in heaven. God said specifically\\n    before the entire heavenly host \"that there is none like him on the earth,\\n    a blameless and upright man, who fears God and turns away from evil\" (Job\\n    1:8).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    So, contrary to the views of most commentators, Elihu did not have a\\n    message from God or even the answer to Job\\'s suffering and he was not sent\\n    to prepare Job for God\\'s visit. While they correctly observe that God did\\n    not condemn him or require an offering from him or even mention him, we\\n    suggest he was so blatantly out of order that Scripture leaves the reader\\n    to correctly assess his discourse. He was clearly Satan\\'s last attempt to\\n    get Job to curse God. Being young in the faith God let him off with a large\\n    measure of grace, sparing him further public humiliation.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    On the other hand Job\\'s friends were Job\\'s age and knew much sound\\n    doctrine. Certainly they should have known better than to charge Job with\\n    specific sins, apparently parroting the idle gossip that spread rumors of\\n    sins supposedly committed by Job. Elihu would see how God dealt with them.\\n    Hopefully someday he would match his zeal for God with spiritual wisdom. In\\n    the end God would say to Eliphaz, \"My anger burns against you and against\\n    your two friends, for you have not spoken of me what is right, as my\\n    servant Job has\" (Job 42:7). In fact, all four taught God was behind human\\n    suffering. This was an attack on the very character of God.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Job had stated over and over that he wanted an audience with God. Elihu\\'s\\n    last words were \"He does not regard any who are wise in their own conceit\"\\n    (Job 37:24). The very next words are \"Then the LORD answered Job out of the\\n    whirlwind and said&#8230;\" (Job 38:1). Contrary to Elihu\\'s pronouncement,\\n    God did come to Job, providing further evidence of just how empty Elihu\\'s\\n    words were.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    With the assault of Elihu the contest was over. Job had not cursed God. God\\n    was vindicated before the angels. Now Job must be restored. As only God\\n    could, He reestablished Job\\'s fellowship and trust in Him and even reunited\\n    him with his friends. How God does this is the subject of chapters 38-42.\\n</p>\\n<p align=\"center\">\\n    <strong>God\\'s Creation Discourse</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    God accomplishes multiple purposes in his discourse to Job. First, Job had\\n    said awful things about God and needed to repent. Second, God\\'s anger\\n    burned against his three friends. They needed to cover their sin with\\n    sacrifice. Third, Job and his friends needed to be reconciled. Fourth, Job\\n    needed to learn the true source of his suffering. In fact, all mankind\\n    needed to know that Satan seeks to destroy us and, in the process, produces\\n    untold suffering. Possibly theological thinking attributed all suffering to\\n    God from creation up to Job\\'s day. This idea was a huge distortion of the\\n    goodness of God and needed to be corrected. In a way, all these individual\\n    purposes come together to broaden our understanding of God\\'s nature. He is\\n    perfect love and perfect righteousness. Job is given to help man see more\\n    of God\\'s glory.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Job felt God did not care about his intense and extended suffering. Job was\\n    wrong. God did care. If Job\\'s condition had been fatal, upon death he would\\n    have been welcomed into paradise with superlatives for his notable faith.\\n    But since God had other plans for Job, He chose to restore his wavering\\n    faith by appearing to him personally and speaking to him more about His\\n    creation than to any other person on record in all of human history. This\\n    was a signal honor. Nevertheless, Job needed to retract statements he had\\n    made about God under duress, so God\\'s instruction took on a very personal\\n    form, numerous direct questions about creation that would cause any\\n    thinking person to realize His careful design of and providential care for\\n    the earth and its inhabitants.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    This was overwhelming evidence that God knew the smallest details about His\\n    creation and therefore, about Job\\'s life as well as ours. God was working.\\n    He was involved. How could Job say God didn\\'t care when His creation shows\\n    He does care. Creation is a huge testimony to God\\'s watching over every\\n    man. Jesus said God sees a single sparrow that falls to the ground and a\\n    person is of far greater value than sparrows. In fact, God numbers every\\n    hair on a person\\'s head (Matt 10:29-31).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Possibly no one has spoken more clearly on the significance of God\\'s\\n    appearance to Job and its meaning than Henry Morris:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>\\n        People say that the Book of Job was written to solve this problem\\n        [human suffering], so what does God have to say about it? Amazingly,\\n        God says nothing about it! His divine message, given out of the\\n        whirlwind, occupies 123 verses in four chapters, yet there is not a\\n        word about the sufferings of Job, or even about human suffering in\\n        general. What God does talk about is creation! The mighty message from\\n        heaven focuses exclusively on the doctrine of special creation of all\\n        things by God, and then his providential care of his creation. It\\n        exalts his power, his wisdom, his purpose, his love.\\n        <a href=\"#_ftn4\" name=\"_ftnref4\" title=\"\">\\n            <sup><strong><sup>[4]</sup></strong></sup>\\n        </a>\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    God first addressed Job with, \"Who is this that darkens counsel by words\\n    without knowledge\" (Job 38:2)? Job repeated this very statement when he\\n    repented indicating they were addressed to him, not Elihu as some\\n    commentators suggest. God then commands Job to \"Dress for action like a\\n    man; I will question you and you make it known to me\" (Job 38:3). It had\\n    been a grueling, exhausting day. How could Job have come to attention and\\n    focused mentally for another hour? Only with God\\'s help. Surely God\\n    strengthened His beloved servant to receive His corrective message. God\\n    would direct the conversation. He would ask the questions. Job was required\\n    to answer.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    First question about creation: \"Where were you when I laid the foundation\\n    of the earth? Tell me, if you have understanding\" (Job 38:4). For starters,\\n    God was asking, \"How much greater is the Almighty than man?\" The missing\\n    answer is \"the Almighty was building a universe when man did not even\\n    exist.\" This measure shows just how insignificant man is in comparison with\\n    the Almighty who set in place the scientific principles that make the\\n    universe work. Job must have thought, \"Oh, Oh! If there are more questions\\n    like this, I won\\'t be doing much answering.\"\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Later in His four-chapter discourse God reproved him with \"Shall a\\n    faultfinder contend with the Almighty? He who argues with God, let him\\n    answer it\" (Job 40:2). God was pointing out that Job had spoken sinfully of\\n    the Creator and he needed to confess his wrong. In the end Job did just\\n    that.\\n</p>\\n<p align=\"center\">\\n    <strong>Effect of God\\'s Questions</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    With the thirty-fourth verse discourse about Leviathan God was done. For\\n    four chapters He had spoken of creating and preserving the universe, the\\n    earth and all living things on it. He spoke with authority and certainty;\\n    yet, underneath was an unspoken message of concern and even pleading with\\n    Job. \"How could you say such things of Me when I have done and continue to\\n    do all this for you?\" These words that seem so stern at first really\\n    contained a deep drawing of Job\\'s heart back to God. Job simply melted; his\\n    heartache vanished; he replaced silence with words of repentance:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>\\n        <sup>2</sup>\\n        I know that you can do all things, and that no purpose of yours can be\\n        thwarted. <sup>3\"</sup>Who is this that hides counsel without\\n        knowledge?\" [Job repeats God\\'s initial question.] Therefore I have\\n        uttered what I did not understand, things too wonderful for me, which I\\n        did not know. <sup>4</sup>Hear, and I will speak; \"I will question you,\\n        and you make it known to me.\" [Job recites God\\'s initial command that\\n        he now answers.] <sup>5</sup>I had heard of you by the hearing of the\\n        ear, but now my eye sees you; <sup>6</sup>therefore I despise myself,\\n        and repent in dust and ashes. Job 42:2-6.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    With this confession of sin Job was again right with God. Now he was needed\\n    to perform a spiritual service, a priestly function. His friends had\\n    stirred God to anger by their false representation of Him. They too must be\\n    brought back to God and Job is asked to be the human agent in this\\n    restoration. God said to Eliphaz the Temanite:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>\\n        <sup>7</sup>\\n        My anger burns against you and against your two friends, for you have\\n        not spoken of me what is right, as my servant Job has. <sup>8</sup>Now\\n        therefore take seven bulls and seven rams and go to my servant Job and\\n        offer up a burnt offering for yourselves. And my servant Job shall pray\\n        for you, for I will accept his prayer not to deal with you according to\\n        your folly. For you have not spoken of me what is right, as my servant\\n        Job has. Job 42:7-8.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Now it was their turn to repent. Verse nine records that they did. They\\n    offered the sacrifices God required. No common person could afford to\\n    sacrifice a bull. The sacrifice of seven bulls and seven rams showed in a\\n    material way how they had been Job\\'s peers, men of wealth. Job witnessed\\n    their act of repentance.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    But how could Job pray for them after all the ugly words between him and\\n    his friends. They had said hateful things of him and he had replied with\\n    increasing rancor: \"No doubt you are the people and wisdom will die with\\n    you\" (Job 12:2); \"You whitewash with lies; worthless physicians are you\\n    all\" (Job 13:4); \"Miserable comforters are you all\" (Job 16:2); \"Ten times\\n    you cast reproach upon me; are you not ashamed to wrong me?\" (Job 19:3);\\n    \"How then will you comfort me with your empty nothings? There is nothing\\n    left of your answers but falsehood\" (Job 21:34); \"How you have helped him\\n    who has no power! How you have counseled him who has no wisdom&#8230;With\\n    whose help have you uttered words?\" (Job 26:1-3). After such sharp words in\\n    their all-day exchange, how could they ever want to speak to each other?\\n    How could they ever want Job\\'s prayers and how could Job find it in his\\n    heart to pray for them? Yet it all happened as God directed:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>\\n        So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the\\n        Naamathite went and did what the LORD had told them, and the LORD\\n        accepted Job\\'s prayer. Job 42:9.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    At the age of 140 Job prayed for them, forgiving every unkind thing they\\n    had said. He illustrates the truth that it is never too late to forgive the\\n    wrongs others have done to us. Job\\'s confidence in God was restored as he\\n    saw God in an entirely new light. For his final 140 years he would share\\n    these radically new insights about the LORD\\'s work in creation and His\\n    providential care for it. In the end his book would become one of the most\\n    proclaimed pieces of literature in all human history.\\n</p>\\n<br clear=\"all\"/>\\n<div>\\n    <br clear=\"all\"/>\\n    <hr width=\"33%\" size=\"1\" align=\"left\"/>\\n    <div id=\"ftn1\">\\n        <p>\\n            <a href=\"#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\" title=\"\">\\n                <sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup>\\n            </a>\\n            Keil, <em>Genesis, Volume I</em>, 60.\\n        </p>\\n    </div>\\n    <div id=\"ftn2\">\\n        <p>\\n            <a href=\"#_ftnref2\" name=\"_ftn2\" title=\"\">\\n                <sup><sup>[2]</sup></sup>\\n            </a>\\n            Henry M.
