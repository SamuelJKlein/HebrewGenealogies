that has escaped explanation for two thousand years. The problem has to do with whether Shem&#39;s genealogy in Genesis 11 is complete or not, and if not, where and how many names are omitted. Historically, the Church has interpreted it as complete, but this view conflicts with numerous other Scriptures. Further, recent discoveries of huge numbers of cuneiform tablets testify to an earlier Flood date than is found by adding the numbers in Shem&#39;s genealogy. We propose that Shem&#39;s list has been shortened from 45-65 names to ten which means the Flood of Noah occurred nearer 4000 BC than 2500 BC. This solution eliminates the many biblical conflicts, confirms recent cuneiform finds and comes with a book full of biblical support. </p><p><b>From the Executive Summary</b></p><a href=\"/The-Hidden-Beauty-of-the-Hebrew-Genealogies.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" download=\"The-Hidden-Beauty-of-the-Hebrew-Genealogies\"><button class=\"btn btn-primary\" style=\"font-size:2rem;color:rgb(119, 68, 99);background-color:white;border:1px solid rgb(119, 68, 99);\"> Download PDF <span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-download\"></span></button></a><a href=\"/executive-summary\"><button class=\"btn btn-primary\" style=\"font-size:2rem;color:rgb(119, 68, 99);background-color:white;margin-left:10px;border:1px solid rgb(119, 68, 99);\"> Read Here <span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-book\"></span></button></a></div><div class=\"col-sm-2\"></div></div><div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-sm-2\"></div><div class=\"col-sm-8 my-center\"><div id=\"about\"><h1><br></h1><h2>About the Author:</h2><img src=\"'+y.a+'\" alt=\"\" style=\"width:20%;\"><h3><b>Lloyd Anderson</b> <i style=\"color:gray;\"></i></h3><p> Lloyd Anderson received his Masters in Theology from Dallas Theological Seminary in 1966.

Without their original\\ninsights this book could not have been written.\\n</p>\\n\\n'},Ne={html:'<h2>\\nExecutive Summary\\n</h2>\\n<p>\\n<em>Hidden Beauty</em>\\noffers to the Body of Christ a promising solution to a nagging and\\ncontentious Bible problem that has escaped explanation for two thousand\\nyears. The problem has to do with whether Shem\\'s genealogy in Genesis 11 is\\ncomplete or not, and if not, where and how many names are omitted.\\nHistorically, the Church has interpreted it as complete, but this view\\nconflicts with numerous other Scriptures. Further, recent discoveries of\\nhuge numbers of cuneiform tablets testify to an earlier Flood date than is\\nfound by adding the numbers in Shem\\'s genealogy. We propose that Shem\\'s\\nlist has been shortened from 45-65 names to ten which means the Flood of\\nNoah occurred nearer 4000 BC than 2500 BC. This solution eliminates the\\nmany biblical conflicts, confirms recent cuneiform finds and comes with a\\nbook full of biblical support.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nOne of those many biblical conflicts involves the Levi-Aaron genealogy.\\nFour times the sequence of Levi-Kohath-Amram-Aaron is stated or inferred (I\\nChronicles 6:1-3; Numbers 3:17-20, 26:57-59; Exodus 6:16, 18, 20). The\\nthinking goes that if it omits names, even though those passages give no\\nhint that names are omitted, maybe Shem\\'s list also omits names. In Levi\\'s\\ncase the issue turns on whether Israel sojourned in Egypt 215 or 430-years.\\nIf 215-years, it could be complete; if 430-years, it cannot be complete.\\nThus, many of those who add Shem\\'s numbers have supported 215-years in a\\nnever-ending 2000-year controversy. When it comes to the lives of Abraham\\nand Jacob, they have invoked unusual explanations to uphold 215-years. The\\nkey verse, Exodus 12:40, allowed either interpretation until scholars in\\nmodern times corrected a textual problem in it. Now it clearly states, \"The\\ntime that the people of Israel lived in Egypt was 430-years.\" (ESV). Levi\\'s\\nlist is incomplete.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nFor 65 years I have studied the Bible as inerrant which means that God was\\nbehind the writing of every word of the Bible so its original documents\\nwere error free. Since 1998 I have had a growing suspicion that Shem\\'s list\\nomits names. More recently I began searching the Bible for an answer.    <strong> </strong>The Shem passage is clear-when Arpachshad had lived 35\\nyears, he fathered Shelah; when Shelah had lived 30 years he fathered Eber,\\netc., etc., (Genesis 11:12 and following). Since God moved the writers of\\nScripture and God cannot lie, people of faith are obligated to take those\\nnumbers literally. While most Evangelical Old Testament scholars suspect\\nShem\\'s list is incomplete, they can\\'t explain how or where.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSlowly it dawned on me that Hebrew genealogies had a different orientation\\nthan the genealogies of most other people groups. Their purpose served to\\nidentify descendants with forefathers and forefathers with descendants\\nrather than establish legal descent. In the thinking of the Hebrew all male\\ndescendants were the sons of their forefathers and all forefathers were the\\nfathers of their descendants.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThis thinking is reflected in the very first verse of the New Testament:\\n\"Jesus Christ, the son of David.\" Since David lived 1000 years before\\nChrist, calling Jesus the \"son of David\" is using \"son\" in the broad sense\\nof the word. Jesus was a descendant of David, not his immediate son. The\\nHebrews used the other common family terms such as \"father,\" \"brother\" and\\neven \"to bear\" (the mother\\'s part), \"to beget\" (the father\\'s part) in the\\nsame way, i.e., in the broad sense as well as in the conventional narrow\\nsense. My favorite verse illustrating this concept is I Chronicles 4:1\\nwhich uses \"son\" in both narrow and broad senses: \"The sons of Judah:\\nPerez, Hezron, Carmi, Hur and Shobal.\" Perez is the only immediate son of\\nJudah in the list. You would never know from the verse that Hezron was a\\ngrandson, Hur and Shobal were great grandsons and Carmi was a distant\\ndescendant. Yet this was one way the Hebrews used \"son\" and other family\\nterms.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIn Shem\\'s case not only is the word \"beget\" found, but also the age of the\\nfather when he begat his son. It would seem that this additional\\ninformation would require \"begat\" to be understood in the narrow sense, but\\nit doesn\\'t. Levi\\'s list shows how to take the begetting age. In a Hebrew\\ngenealogical list factual data about a parent refers to the next\\ngeneration, whether named or omitted. If omitted, \"beget/bear\" is used in\\nthe broad sense of a descendant born further down the line.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBut where and how many generations are missing in Shem\\'s case? The Bible\\ngives an overwhelming clue. All those who died before the Flood lived about\\n900 years while the longevity of those born after the Flood steadily\\ndeclined from 438 to 70 years (Genesis 11:12; Psalm 90:10). While there\\nwere special cases the overall decline appears small to begin with, then\\nvaried from four to eight years per generation before eventually declining\\nto about two or three years per generation and finally ceasing. But there\\nis one glaring exception. The decline between the third and fourth names is\\n61% of the total decline. By dividing this huge decline by the\\nper-generation decline and making other adjustments, 35-55 generations seem\\nto be missing (1300-1900 years). What clarified this issue? Here was the\\nbreak through: coming to realize that the Flood itself was so violent that\\nit permanently cut human longevity in half.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe multiplication of Noah\\'s descendants totally agrees with the appearance\\nof the world\\'s first advanced societies. An advanced society is defined as\\none that has developed a written language. After the Ark came to rest where\\nthe mountains of Ararat eventually arose, Noah\\'s descendants migrated to\\nthe plains of Southern Mesopotamia and built a city (Genesis 8-11). In\\nseeing this city God said that now nothing they proposed would be\\nimpossible (Genesis 11:6) so He confused their tongues. Speaking different\\nlanguages forced them to spread out. After a time one group reduced its\\nlanguage to writing. Secular history has concluded that the very first\\nsociety to develop a written language was the Southern Mesopotamian people\\nof Sumer about 3000 BC. The Egyptians soon followed with hieroglyphics.\\nOther Near East peoples adopted their languages to Sumer\\'s cuneiform\\nscript. Secular history confirms Scripture\\'s record with regard to the\\nlocation of the world\\'s first advanced societies.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nNoah\\'s Flood brought on the Ice Age which lasted over a thousand years and\\nimpacted all of his descendants for centuries. Those who settled in the\\nupper latitudes resorted to survival tactics-stone tools and caves. Those\\nin the lower latitudes experienced powerful and frequent rain storms that\\ncaused permanent vegetation in areas of the Near East now desert. As a\\nresult, large populations developed in one place while elsewhere cave men\\nstruggled to survive. Job lived about 16 generations before Abraham, dying\\nat the age of 280. His book speaks of these heavy rains, numerous other ice\\nage phenomena, an extensive population in Arabia and even dinosaurs in the\\nJordan Valley, all forgotten by Abraham\\'s day.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWhen one understands how to take Hebrew genealogies and applies that\\nknowledge to Shem\\'s list, dozens of misinterpretations of Scripture are\\ncorrected and Scripture stands with greater trustworthiness and authority.    <em>Hidden Beauty</em> is long because it must overcome much\\ndisinformation. Determine for yourself if the following pages are\\nconvincing or not.\\n</p>\\n\\n'},ze={html:'<h2>\\nForeword\\n</h2>\\n<p align=\"center\">\\n(Yet to be written- OT Hebrew Authority Needed)\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAs of July 2022 none of the world\\'s leading inerrancy Hebrew/Old Testament\\nscholars has agreed to review this book. Maybe they are too busy; maybe\\nthis issue is not that important; maybe it is too unique. But this does not\\nmean that competent scholars with doctors\\' degrees have not reviewed this\\nmaterial. The author has communicated with three who have encouraged the\\npublishing of these ideas. All three are respected senior scholars at or\\nnear the end of fruitful lifetime ministries in teaching the Old Testament.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIn contrast those who reject the idea that Shem\\'s list is incomplete do not\\nhave this kind of experience or even these skills. Chapter 17 explains the\\ndifference between true scholars and those who add Shem\\'s numbers to\\ndeclare the date of the Flood. Some of the latter have corresponded\\npersonally with me. Their explanations and arguments are unconvincing and\\nwithout merit. For the sake of unity in the Body of Christ I will not\\nidentify them. Love among the brethren is the greater requirement.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe true issue of this book is the practice of Scripture. Is it true that\\nit uses family terms in a broad sense as well as in the standard narrow\\nsense? Is it true that the details of Amram and Jochebed were true of the\\nparents of their unnamed immediate son and that the Hebrew verb \"to bear\"\\nrefers to bearing Miriam, Aaron and Moses in the broad sense of being born\\nsomewhere down the line? Is it true that there is a 61% decrease in\\nlongevity between Eber and Peleg and other than this enormous decrease, the\\naverage generational decrease was never higher than six or seven years and\\neventually declined to zero by the end of Moses life? Yes. These biblical\\nuses are clear and they are the point of this book. Thus, the Flood\\noccurred nearer 4000 B.C. than 2500 B.C.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nMaybe someday the needed Old Testament Hebrew authority will come forward.\\n</p>\\n<p align=\"right\">\\nLloyd T.

For example, advanced societies thrived\\nacross the Near East when the numbers of Shem\\'s genealogy are used to\\ndetermine the date of Noah\\'s Flood. There is no error in Scripture so we\\nneed to understand the method that the Jewish people used in compiling\\ngenealogies and read accordingly. With this help we can affirm the\\ninerrancy of Biblical statements without denying the overwhelming testimony\\nof historical studies.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nFurthermore, if we understand the OT practice of condensing genealogies, we\\nwill not unnecessarily give people an excuse to attack the Bible as being\\nunreliable. Therefore, such insight is very important. In fact, it is so\\nimportant that we call those methods \"the hidden beauty of Hebrew\\ngenealogies.\" This hidden beauty focuses on identity in the family line,\\nnot necessarily the succession from father to son. It sometimes includes\\nsignificant gaps. Such understanding harmonizes those words and numbers of\\nthe Old Testament often viewed as contradictions and clumsily\\nreinterpreted.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe Executive Summary (pages 5-6) explains the conclusion of this book-that\\nShem\\'s genealogy of Genesis 11 omits 35-55 generations. This chapter\\nintroduces the first evidence for that conclusion. The Levi-Aaron list\\ncovers about 500 years which includes the 430-years Israel dwelt in Egypt.\\nYet it contains just four people (Levi-Kohath-Amram-Aaron). We are given\\nmuch information about them, even their overlapping life spans which fail\\nto bridge those 500 years. The list omits up to a dozen names.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThis position has not been the view of the church historically. The reason\\nhas to do with the number of years Israel sojourned in Egypt. Whether it\\nwas 215 or 430-years has been a continuing controversy for 2000 years. The\\npreponderance of Scriptural evidence favors 430 but historical evidence\\nsupported 215. For instance, the Septuagint (i.e., the Greek translation of\\nthe Old Testament) says Israel sojourned in Canaan and Egypt 430-years.\\nEarly authorities like Josephus concurred. The church fathers added their\\n\"Amen.\" Because the Hebrew text of the key passage, Exodus 12:40, had a\\nproblem, it could be understood to mean that 430-years was the total time\\nin Canaan <strong>and</strong> Egypt. Events in the lives of Abraham and\\nJacob were then erroneously interpreted to support a 215-year Egyptian\\nsojourn. As a result, the Levi-Aaron list was viewed as complete. To this\\nday some still insist that Israel only sojourned 215-years in Egypt.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWhile 430-years in Egypt only adds a few years to the antiquity of Noah\\'s\\nFlood, an incomplete Levi list opens the door to other Old Testament\\ngenealogies being incomplete. An abbreviated Shem list could push the date\\nfor the Flood back hundreds or even thousands of years. To find the\\napproximate time of the Flood, <em>Hidden Beauty</em> must address the many\\ncontroversies that have clouded this question. In the process the book has\\nbecome very long.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBefore proceeding, it must be stated that foundational to this book is the\\ndoctrine of the inerrancy of Scripture, the biblical truth that God so\\nmoved its authors that they wrote His message without error. It applies to\\nevery word of the original writings. It means that all Scripture was\\noriginally in harmony with the original writings of all other\\nScripture-that no statement contradicted any other statement in its\\noriginal writing. It also means that all Scripture is important, that every\\nword is equally true, that no Scripture should be dismissed, overlooked or\\nregarded as insignificant. The church has restated this doctrine at\\ncritical times in history. Most recently in the Fall of 1978 an\\ninternational gathering of nearly 300 noted evangelical scholars produced\\n\"The Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy\" which reaffirmed this truth\\nin clear but precise terms.    <a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\" title=\"\"><sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup></a>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBecause Scripture is God\\'s word, it is the final authority on every issue\\nit addresses. In this book every effort is made to answer each issue solely\\non the basis of what the Bible itself says. After determining what\\nScripture says, the secular view of where and when advanced societies first\\ndeveloped will be discussed because surprisingly it supports what the Bible\\nhas said all along. Also, by way of introduction the following purpose and\\nfunction of Hebrew genealogies must ever be in the minds of those who\\ndiscuss them.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Overview of Hebrew Genealogies</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nMost peoples, and especially the West, have used genealogies and\\nchronologies to display an unbroken list of immediate relationships such as\\nfather-son, rulers, priests, etc. In contrast, the basic idea of Hebrew\\ngenealogies was identity, not succession. Hebrews identified descendants\\nwith their forefathers and forefathers with their descendants. It could be\\nboiled down to this: all descendants were in the loins of their forefathers\\nand all forefathers were the fathers of their descendants. It was perfectly\\naccurate in Hebrew usage to say B was the son of A or to say G was the son\\nof A when actually generations B-F came between A and G.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nFor example, Hebrew genealogies could be as specific as Adam knew Eve who\\nconceived Cain (Genesis 4:1) or as broad as \"Jesus Christ, the son of\\nDavid\" (Matthew 1:1). Cain was the immediate result of the union of Adam\\nand Eve. There were no intermediate generations between the parents and\\ntheir son. This is the narrow use in Hebrew thinking (A begat B). On the\\nother hand, one thousand years separated David from his distant son Jesus\\nChrist. This is the broad use of genealogies in Scripture (A begat G). The\\nbroad use could compact many generations into one, yet be perfectly\\ntruthful. The intentional skipping or omitting of names could be considered\\ncondensing or abbreviating. It was beautifully efficient and simple.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nMatthew made no error when he wrote \"Jesus Christ, the son of David.\" His\\npurpose was to identify Jesus Christ with David genealogically. Authors of\\nScripture determined the degree of completeness of a blood line, often\\nproviding only as many names as their purpose required. Those in the day of\\nany particular author would discern whether his list was complete or not,\\nbut as time passed this discernment became more difficult. In time, even\\nBible scholars, misunderstanding this broader use of Hebrew genealogies,\\nbegan to wrest the Scripture with their interpretations.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Condensing a Genealogical List-A Clear OT Example </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nA 215-year sojourn by Jacob and his descendants in Egypt is an essential\\nelement in the historic view that the Flood occurred about 2348 BC\\naccording to Archbishop James Ussher. His monumental work,    <em>Annals of the World</em>, first published in Latin in 1650, used the\\ntypical approach of working back from later known dates to Abraham. This\\nmethod then added the years when each father in Shem\\'s genealogy of Genesis\\n11 had his heir to finally reach the Flood date.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nA 430-year Egyptian sojourn adds a mere 215-years to this date. But\\nrecognizing a 430-year Egyptian sojourn introduces a game-changing\\nprecedent. It means that many names are omitted in Levi\\'s genealogy that\\nappears to be complete. Since the Shem list has characteristics similar to\\nthe Levi-Aaron list, it opens the door to omitted names in that list which\\nsome vehemently deny.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWhile many have been told that Scripture is confusing about the years\\nIsrael spent in Egypt, the next chapter will show that no less than God\\nHimself witnessed to a 430-year sojourn there. But that is not all. Moses\\nlikewise witnessed to 430-years in Egypt. Then over a millennium later\\nStephen affirmed God\\'s word and Paul affirmed Moses\\' word. On the other\\nhand, nowhere does Scripture state that Israel sojourned in Egypt\\n215-years. Nowhere!\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThen where did the idea of 215-years in Egypt come from? It was primarily\\nfrom a deduction made from the following words in Exodus and Numbers which\\nlists Kohath as a son of Levi, Amram as a son of Kohath and Aaron as a son\\nof Amram:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    <sup>16</sup>\\n    These are the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations:\\n    Gershon, Kohath, and Merari, the years of the life of Levi being 137\\n    years. <sup>18</sup>The sons of Kohath: Amram&#8230;, the years of the\\n    life of Kohath being 133 years. <sup>20</sup>Amram took as his wife\\n    Jochebed his father\\'s sister, and she bore him Aaron and Moses, the\\n    years of the life of Amram being 137 years. Exodus 6:16, 18, 20.\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    <sup>58</sup>\\n    These are the clans of Levi: &#8230;of Kohath, the clan of the\\n    Kohathites; &#8230;And Kohath was the father of Amram. <sup>59</sup>The\\n    name of Amram\\'s wife was Jochebed the daughter of Levi, who was born to\\n    Levi in Egypt. And she bore to Amram Aaron and Moses and Miriam their\\n    sister. Numbers 26:58-59.\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWhile the two narratives appear to be a full and complete record of descent\\n(Levi-Kohath-Amram-Aaron), the following pages conclusively demonstrate\\nthat these genealogical records are abbreviated. But the historic approach\\nviews them as complete which requires rewriting much other Scripture. In so\\ndoing the cardinal rule of interpretation-inerrancy-is violated. This book\\nwill apply the broader concept of the nature and function of Hebrew\\ngenealogies to such passages. With this approach those violations of\\nScripture will be eliminated.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe passages above report three generations leading to Aaron-that of Levi,\\nKohath and Amram. No one disputes the relationships in these four\\ngenerations, i.e., that Kohath was a direct descendant of Levi, that Amram\\nwas a direct descendant of Kohath and that Aaron was a direct descendant of\\nAmram. When Jacob moved his people to Egypt, Levi was about 46 years old so\\nhis sons may have been teenagers or even in their twenties. All Jacob\\'s\\nmale descendants accompanied him to Egypt except Joseph and his sons who\\nwere already there. Genesis 46:8-26 records that list and begins:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    <sup>8</sup>\\n    Now these are the names of the descendants of Israel, who came into\\n    Egypt, Jacob and his sons, Reuben, Jacob\\'s firstborn, <sup>9</sup>and\\nthe sons of Reuben.&#8230; <sup>10</sup>The sons of Simeon&#8230;.        <sup>11</sup>The sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath and Merari. Genesis\\n    46:8-11.\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nKohath is among the names in the list above. He was born in Canaan before\\nthe move to Egypt. The next generation mentioned after Kohath was Amram.\\nExodus says Amram was a son of Kohath. Numbers agrees, saying Kohath was\\nthe father of Amram. Each passage validates the other. Both Exodus and\\nNumbers report that Amram and his wife had children-Exodus reports the\\nbirths of Aaron and Moses while Numbers reveals the names of three-Aaron,\\nMoses and Miriam. The 215-year view teaches these four\\ngenerations-Levi-Kohath-Amram-Aaron-are consecutive, i.e., immediate\\nfather-son relationships and span the 215-years in Egypt.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nHow long of a sojourn in Egypt could they possibly span? Let\\'s calculate.\\nSuppose each of these generations dwelling in Egypt fathered his named son\\nin the last year of his life. This number would be the maximum number of\\nyears these four generations could have contributed to the total sojourn in\\nEgypt if the genealogies were consecutive without any gaps or omissions.\\nThen that number could be viewed in the light of a 215 or 430-year sojourn.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nCalculations: Aaron was 83 at the time of the Exodus, so he accounts for 83\\nyears in Egypt (Exodus 7:7). Levi\\'s grandson, Amram lived 137 years (Exodus\\n6:20), all of them in Egypt. Add: 137 + 83 = 220 years. None of Levi\\'s\\nyears in Egypt can count since his son Kohath was already alive when they\\nmoved to Egypt. The only father left to contribute years in Egypt is\\nKohath. How many years did he contribute? Scripture doesn\\'t tell his age\\nwhen they arrived, so for contrast both the maximum and minimum years\\npossible will be calculated.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<u>Kohath\\'s minimum age</u>\\n: he was alive when they moved down to Egypt and he had a younger brother.\\nIf his younger brother had just been born, Kohath could have been as young\\nas one year old.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<u>Kohath\\'s maximum age</u>\\n: eleven sons were born to Jacob within a nine-year time span at uncle\\nLaban\\'s place. Levi was #3 and Joseph was #11. Thus, Levi was born about\\ntwo years into the nine-year time span while Joseph was born last so he was\\nborn about seven years later. This makes Levi about seven years older than\\nJoseph. Scripture reveals that Joseph was 39 when his family joined him in\\nEgypt; Levi would have been about 46 (39+7=46). At this time Jacob\\'s sons\\nwere starting families when they were very young, even younger than 20. If\\nLevi\\'s second son, Kohath, was born when his father was just 20, he would\\nhave been 26 when they moved to Egypt.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<u>Maximum Range for the age of Kohath</u>\\n: So Kohath could have been as young as one or as old as 26 when the family\\nmoved to Egypt. If he were just one year old, he would contribute the most\\nnumber of years to the Egyptian sojourn. So that number will be found\\nfirst. Kohath died at the age of 133 (Exodus 6:18) so he could have\\ncontributed as many as 132 years to Israel\\'s time in Egypt. Now the numbers\\nare available to determine the absolute maximum number of years in Egypt if\\nthis genealogy (Levi-Kohath-Amram-Aaron) is complete. Aaron provides 83\\nyears. Amram provides another 137 years and Kohath could have provided up\\nto 132 years. The total is 352 (83+137+132=352).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThree hundred fifty-two years is the maximum number of years these three\\nnamed fathers could contribute towards Israel\\'s total sojourn in Egypt if\\nthis list is complete. Although, it is most unlikely that a father would\\nhave had his named heir in the very year he died at such an advanced age.\\nFor this to happen twice in a row is even more unlikely. As already noted,\\nJacob\\'s sons were starting families as early as the age of 20. But for now,\\nthe maximum possible number of years in Egypt has been found if this\\ngenealogy is complete. That total number of years, 352 years, is more than\\nenough for a 215-year sojourn but it is not enough for a 430-year sojourn.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBecause of this the 215-year people conclude that when Moses said Israel\\'s\\nsojourn was 430-years (Exodus 12:40), he was referring to the entire time\\nfrom Abraham\\'s arrival in Canaan until the Exodus. Scripture reports that\\nAbraham, Isaac and Jacob lived in Canaan 215-years before the move to\\nEgypt. The remaining 215-years would be the years that are left for\\nIsrael\\'s sojourn in Egypt. Thus, they say, Israel sojourned in Egypt 215,\\nnot 430-years.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBut that interpretation conflicts with the very words of God, Stephen and\\nPaul as well as those of Moses, all of whom uphold the 430-year number for\\nthe years Israel was in Egypt. In effect this approach jumps from the\\nfrying pan-trying to escape the difficulty of Exodus 6 and Numbers 26-into\\nthe fire-doing violence to the words of God, Moses, Stephen and Paul. If\\nthe Exodus and Numbers passages will only support a 215-year sojourn while\\nthe four witnesses testify to a 430-year sojourn, the Bible apparently is\\ncontradicting itself and inerrancy is compromised. Since inerrancy assures\\nthat Scripture does not contradict itself, how is this dilemma resolved?\\nThe answer is found in the hidden beauty of Hebrew genealogies.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>The Hidden Beauty of Hebrew Genealogies</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBecause Biblical Hebrew relational terms were used in both narrow and broad\\nsenses, \"father\" could mean father, grandfather or ancestor. The same was\\ntrue of son, beget, and other common kinship terms. In Hebrew genealogies\\nboth the narrow and broad senses of these family relationships were\\nemployed. In the Levi-Aaron genealogy the maximum possible consecutive\\nyears of the named four living in Egypt (352) falls short of 430-years in\\nEgypt. To get 430-years more generations are needed. Since they are not\\nstated, <strong>this genealogy is abbreviated.</strong> Generations are\\nomitted. The following table shows the impossibility of four generations\\nspanning 430-years on the left and therefore what missing generations might\\nlook like on the right.\\n</p>\\n<table width=\"622\"

Amram had a son who had a son and somewhere down\\nthe line Aaron, Moses and Miriam were born. To say Aaron was the son of\\nAmram when many generations came in between is no different than Matthew\\n1:1 saying Jesus Christ was the son of David when many generations came in\\nbetween. This was a common and accepted way for ancient Hebrews to state\\ntheir genealogical relationships.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Conclusion to the 215/430 Debate</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThis chapter began by pointing out that a 215-year Egyptian sojourn is not\\nstated in Scripture but is primarily a deduction based on the Levi-Aaron\\ngenealogy recorded in Exodus 6 and Numbers 26. The few generations stated\\nin those two passages do not permit a 430-year sojourn. While those\\npassages appear to be reporting that a grandson of Levi married a daughter\\nof Levi and they became the immediate parents of Miriam, Aaron and Moses,\\nthat is the overview but there is more to the story. Rather Amram and\\nJochebed had these children through intermediate generations. Omitting\\ngenerations between Amram and Aaron was not a scribal error; it was a way\\nto state genealogies efficiently.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Nature of the Levi-Aaron Abbreviation</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe Jewish people all descended from a common ancestor. The God of creation\\ntold that ancestor, Abraham, that He would make of him a great nation. His\\ngrandson, Jacob, had twelve sons. Each formed a unit of the promised nation\\ncalled a tribe. The sons and sometimes further descendants of these tribal\\nfathers formed units within each tribe with various designations. As\\npopulations increased in succeeding generations that division was further\\nbroken down into a third level. It also had various names. Knowing a\\nperson\\'s identity with these three levels provided a powerful picture of\\nthe person. It showed where he belonged in the nation.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nGod said all booty from the battle of Jericho was under a ban. A soldier\\nviolated the ban. In judgment God caused the Israelites to lose their next\\nbattle. When the leaders cried out to God, He said to find the guilty\\nsoldier and execute him. To find him they were to bring each tribe before\\nthe LORD. Scripture continues: \"And the tribe that the LORD takes by lot\\nshall come near by clans. And the clan that the LORD takes shall come near\\nby households. And the household that the LORD takes shall come near man by\\nman\" Joshua 7:14. Here is an instance where God Himself spoke of those\\nthree levels of organization of the nation-He called them tribe, clan and\\nhousehold (ESV). While Scripture uses various designations for them in\\nother places, here God used specific designations for them. This book will\\nfollow His example and refer to that first level as tribe, to the second\\nlevel as clan and to the third level as household.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWithout question Levi, the third son of Jacob, formed a tribe. Numbers 26\\nspeaks of the second census of Israel. It was conducted just before\\nentering Canaan. The tribe of Levi was dedicated to the spiritual life of\\nIsrael so its population was not counted with the other tribes that became\\nthe army of Israel. In the census each of the twelve ordinary tribes are\\nindividually named. In doing so Scripture speaks of each son as follows:\\n\"Reuben, the firstborn of Israel, the sons of Reuben: of anoch, the clan of\\nthe HanochitesH\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nHanoch, the clans of the Hanochites&#8230;.\" Numbers 26:5. The chapter\\nlists each of the twelve tribes with the same sons as found in the list\\nthat went to Egypt 470 years earlier. Then it speaks of the tribe of Levi\\nin the same way: \"This was the list of the Levites according to their\\nclans: of Gershon, the clan of the Gershonites; of Kohath, the clan of the\\nKohathites; of Merari, the clan of the Merarites\" (Numbers 26:58). Next it\\nsays that Kohath was the father of Amram. So, the organization of Israel\\nadds to the view that these names are consecutive: Levi-Kohath-Amram.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWhen Moses recorded the Levi-Aaron list, he first cited the tribe that\\nAaron belonged to (Levi), then the clan (Kohath) and finally the household\\n(Amram). He knew who Aaron\\'s father, grandfather and great grandfather\\nwere. But they were unknown and unimportant to the nation at large. To list\\nthem would have been tedious, clumsy and unnecessary. But knowing the three\\nlevels of Aaron\\'s ancestry was very important. This pedigree showed that\\nboth Aaron and his younger brother Moses were part of the very foundation\\nof the nation. While God called Moses and authenticated him with signs,\\nancestors that laid the foundation of the Hebrew people added respect and\\nlegitimacy to him as God\\'s chosen leader. This understanding of purpose\\nexplains why Levi\\'s list is so short. Moses omitted all the generations\\nbetween Amram and Aaron. The existence of one undeniably abbreviated Hebrew\\ngenealogy in Scripture sets a precedent. If one genealogy was abbreviated,\\nothers could be as well. <strong></strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Implications for Shem\\'s Genealogy </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWhile the abbreviation of most Hebrew genealogies would have no significant\\neffect on the date of the Flood, an abbreviation in Shem\\'s genealogy would.\\nThen, adding those numbers would give an incorrect date. But Shem\\'s\\ngenealogy contains a feature that makes it different from the Levi-Aaron\\nlist. It not only identifies each father\\'s son but gives the year when that\\nson was born, saying two years after the Flood a son by the name of\\nArpachshad was born to Shem (Genesis 11:10). It continues by saying that\\nwhen Arpachshad had lived 35 years, he fathered Shelah (Genesis 11:12).\\nScripture states the age of each succeeding father when his heir was born.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThis feature appears to assure that Shem\\'s list is complete-no ifs, ands or\\nbuts. Nevertheless, in view of the fact that most inerrancy scholars are\\ncertain the Ussher date is too late, is there anything in Scripture to\\nsuggest the years of any of the fathers might be interpreted differently?\\nDoes Scripture anywhere provide information or give an example that would\\nanswer this difficulty? In fact it does. The very iron-clad genealogy of\\nLevi provides a completely satisfactory solution to the Shem issue in the\\nfollowing way.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWhat is overlooked is that the Levi-Aaron list also gives factual details\\nabout the father before the confirmed omission. While some of that\\ninformation could be true of Aaron\\'s immediate parents, other factual\\ndetails make it impossible for Amram to be the immediate father of Aaron.\\nIf so, to whom does that factual information apply? It must be true of the\\nunnamed immediate son of Amram and only in a broad sense is it true of any\\nfurther omitted generations and of Aaron. The following paragraphs identify\\nan amazing list of factual details about the generation in question.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe father at issue is the third name in the Levi-Kohath-Amram-Aaron\\ngenealogy, Amram. The following facts are stated in Scripture about him:\\nfirst, Amram is the first of four named sons born to Kohath (Exodus 6:18).\\nRemember, Kohath was alive when Jacob joined Joseph to begin the sojourn in\\nEgypt. Second, Amram took a wife (Exodus 6:20). Third, her name was\\nJochebed (Exodus 6:20, Numbers 26:59). Fourth, she was the daughter of Levi\\n(Numbers 26:59); fifth, she was the sister of Amram\\'s father (Exodus 6:20)\\nand, sixth, she was born in Egypt (Numbers 26:59). In other words this\\ndaughter of Levi was not born in Canaan like Levi\\'s three sons-Gershon,\\nKohath and Merari (Genesis 46:11). Rather, she was born after the move,\\nmaking her younger than her three brothers.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSeventh, since Amram was not listed among those sons of Jacob that moved to\\nEgypt (Genesis 46:11), he, too, was born after the move, that is, he too\\nwas born in Egypt. If Scripture hadn\\'t included the information about\\nJochebed being born in Egypt, it might have left the impression that Amram\\nmarried someone old enough to be his mother. Eighth, in addition to Aaron,\\nMoses was also born to Amram (Exodus 6:20). Ninth, in addition to Aaron and\\nMoses, Miriam was also born to Amram and Jochebed (Numbers 26:59). Indeed,\\ndepending on what is counted, up to nine specific facts are revealed in\\nScripture about the third generation male in the Levi-Aaron list of Exodus\\n6:18-22 and Numbers 26:58-59.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBecause Hebrews commonly named descendants after famous ancestors, some of\\nthese facts could apply to the parents of Aaron. But the fact that both\\nAmram and Jochebed were born at the beginning of the 430-year sojourn in\\nEgypt while Aaron was born near the end of that 430-year period separates\\nthe third and fourth names in the Levi list by some 300 years. Three\\nhundred years makes it impossible for Aaron to be the immediate son of\\nAmram. Therefore, those nine entirely true factual details about Amram\\napply to his unnamed son and only by the Hebrew custom of viewing all\\ndescendants as the son of the father do they apply to Aaron.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSome might suggest that numbers are more factual than other information,\\nthat in the statement \"When Eber had lived 34 years, he fathered Peleg\"\\n(Genesis 11:16), the number \"34\" is an absolute fact and cannot be viewed\\nin any other way. We agree. The number \"34\" is an absolute fact. It cannot\\nbe viewed in any other way. It is just like the absolute fact of Jochebed\\nbeing born in Egypt. Thus, the entire list of nine facts about Amram cannot\\nbe viewed in any other way. The insight lacking through all church history\\nwas that Scripture used Hebrew family relational terms in both a narrow\\nsense and a broad sense. The question here is whether Eber fathering Peleg\\nis used in a narrow sense or broad sense. If the writer used it in the\\nbroad sense, generations are omitted between Eber and Peleg.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe Levi-Aaron list becomes the biblical pattern for understanding details\\nof a father before a suspected omission. The details apply to the first\\nunnamed son while the name that appears is used in the broad sense of a son\\nfurther down the line. For beyond doubt names are missing between Amram and\\nAaron because Aaron came some 300 years after Amram. To remove that\\nimpossible timespan previous generations argued fiercely for a 215-year\\nsojourn in Egypt. Since some creationists still hold that view, the entire\\nnext chapter explains the impossibility of that position.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWhen the biblical pattern is applied to Shem\\'s list, if there are one or\\nmore omissions, the age of the father when his heir was born refers\\nspecifically to the first unnamed generation. But a high degree of\\ncertainty is needed to suspect names are omitted from any list. Shem\\'s list\\ngives two. First is the impossibly late Flood date it produces apart from\\nomitted names. But chapter seven gives an overwhelming second reason. While\\nlongevity decreased between two and eight years per generation after the\\nFlood, the decrease between Eber and Peleg was 225 years or 61% of the\\nentire decrease from the Flood until human longevity stabilized at 70 years\\nfor a full lifetime. The Eber-Peleg record is another Amram-Aaron case.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Viewing Shem\\'s List as a Chrono-Genealogy </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThose holding that Shem\\'s list is complete add the ages of the fathers when\\ntheir sons were fathered and declare that those years make it possible to\\ndetermine the date of the Flood. They call that type of genealogy a\\nchrono-genealogy. They then reason that even if there are omitted<strong><u>names</u></strong> between Eber and Peleg the<strong><u>number</u></strong> 34 ties Peleg to a    <strong><u>chronology</u></strong> and therefore the total time between\\nEber and Peleg cannot exceed 34 years. This argument is also called the\\n\"bookends\" argument.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nYet, how is a number different from any other category of words that\\nexpress an absolutely true detail, such as the detail that Jochebed was the\\nsister of Amram\\'s father who lived at the beginning of the 430-year sojourn\\nin Egypt? Clearly there is no difference. Numbers are no different from\\nother precise words expressing a fact. Words that express true facts are\\ntrue whether they are numbers or not. The bookend argument makes a\\nsuperficial distinction between numbers and other words and interjects a\\nfalse element into the time of the Flood debate.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWhile that argument is clever, it is incorrect and must be recognized as an\\ninvention of man to support a particular interpretation of how to treat\\nthose numbers. It is not stated by Scripture and violates how Scripture\\nitself treats such details in Levi\\'s genealogy. Further it is not verified\\nby Moses in as much as he did not add up those numbers in Shem\\'s list. Most\\nimportant of all this argument could not be why God included those numbers\\nbecause they give the wrong answer for the time of the Flood.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThose who hold this view reason: \"Why else would Eber\\'s age be given when\\nhe fathered Peleg other than to tell when the Flood happened?\" In response\\nAndrew E. Steinmann answered this question (applying it to Genesis 5 as\\nwell as Genesis 11 since the two instances of this format actually provide\\na stronger case against viewing them as having a chronological purpose):\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    This [chrono-genealogical argument] assumes that the information was\\n    included for chronological purposes and then argues that the\\n    genealogies must therefore be useful for chronological calculations. In\\n    fact, the author does not state the reason for including this\\n    information&#8230;. This information could well have illustrated\\n    several points without being intended to be used in chronological\\n    calculations relating to the events of the narrative. For instance, the\\n    information may simply have been intended to demonstrate:\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>1. </strong>\\n<strong>\\n    The different environmental and societal conditions that prevailed in\\n    that era. People not only lived longer in Genesis 5, they matured more\\n    slowly and/or married at a later age.\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>2. </strong>\\n<strong>\\n    That conditions had changed in Genesis 11 and people came to marry and\\n    have children at a younger age, and they lived shorter lives.\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>3. </strong>\\n<strong>\\n    That the persons in genealogies were actual historical persons, not\\n    fictions or fictionalized historical persons.\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    These points could be illustrated with selective genealogies that do\\n    not include every generation. The information would not be superfluous,\\n    but it also would not be useful for the purpose of chronological\\n    calculations.\\n    <a href=\"#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\" title=\"\">\\n        <sup><strong><sup>[2]</sup></strong></sup>\\n    </a>\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIn fact, the merits of the chrono-genealogical argument are not strong in\\nthe eyes of most Bible scholars. Moses wrote around 1400 BC when the\\nlifespan of man was 70. Saying that people once lived to the age of 900\\nwould be met with skepticism. Moses knew about the well-known fictitious\\nstories of exceptionally long lifespans in the past. The Sumerian King List\\nincluded one king who was said to have reigned 43,200 years. Moses\\' numbers\\nhad to be separated from such exaggerations. By giving the years before the\\nbirth of the heir, the years after and the total years of each father in\\nGenesis 5, God through Moses did all He could to assure His readers those\\npeople actually lived that long. Furthermore, those numbers provide the\\nvery patterns that have aided us in building our explanations concerning\\nman\\'s decreasing longevity which is the key argument for the missing 35-55\\ngenerations between Eber and Peleg.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIn the Abstract of Steinmann\\'s 2018 article, he noted a recent spate of\\narticles arguing that the genealogies of Genesis 5 and 11 were complete,\\nskipping no generations. In checking his observation this author found that\\nthree of the articles in a single issue of a popular monthly\\nage-of-the-earth magazine mentioned the too-recent year number. Steinmann\\nsummarized his article as follows:\\n<a name=\"_Hlk85297349\">\\n    \"\\n    <strong>\\n        The major arguments they use are defective and falsifiable\\n    </strong>\\n    .\"\\n</a>\\n<a href=\"#_ftn3\" name=\"_ftnref3\" title=\"\"><sup><sup>[3]</sup></sup></a>\\nHis version is 18 pages. But he only scratches the surface. Somewhere a\\nbook must spell it all out in detail. Hopefully by showing the nature and\\nfunction of ancient Hebrew genealogies <em>Hidden Beauty</em> will open\\npeople\\'s eyes to the frequent abbreviating of biblical genealogies.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>The Abbreviation of Shem\\'s Genealogy in Retrospect</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nHuman longevity declined gradually from the first fathers born after the\\nFlood until the days of Moses, from average full lifespans of 450 years to\\naverage full lifespans of 70 years. This is an average full lifespan\\ndecline of 380 years. Scripture gives abundant details to track this\\ndecline. Shelah who represents the second generation born after the Flood\\n(433-year lifespan), lived five fewer years than his father (438-year\\nlifespan) who was born two years after the Flood. Over the next two\\nmillennia the rate of decline was sometimes faster and sometimes slower but\\nlongevity stopped declining in Moses\\' day when he wrote that a full\\nlifetime was 70 years. To this day 70 years generally stands as a full\\nlifespan. But there was one exception during the gradual decline of those\\nborn after the Flood, a sudden one-time drop of 225 years. This one\\ninstance is between Eber and Peleg. Eber lived 464 years while Peleg, the\\nnext named person, lived 239 years, a decline of 225 years or 61%\\n(225/369=61%) of the total decline of human longevity after the Flood. This\\neye-popping decline was either produced by another catastrophe as great as\\nthe Flood or it is another Amram-Aaron case. There is no evidence for such\\na catastrophe 100 years after the Flood. Thus, it is another Amram-Aaron\\ncase.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe Amram-Aaron sequence leaves out an estimated 8-12 generations. The\\nEber-Peleg sequence leaves out as many as 55 generations. With new\\ngenerations starting each 30-34 years when people lived 200-450 years, this\\nrepresents up to 1900 more years of human history after the Flood than\\npreviously thought (and pushes the first man back accordingly). Since God\\nis not more specific, we dare not violate this ambiguity. These few\\nadditional years make no difference at all in the creation-evolution\\ncontroversy, but they make a world of difference in honoring Scripture\\nbecause they treat both the words and numbers of Scripture as inerrant.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nOnce we understand what the Bible literally says, we are free to examine\\nthe findings of secular disciplines; for, sooner or later when the secular\\nworld has all the facts, it will confirm God\\'s record. So, have such\\nfindings caught up with the revelation of Scripture? The Flood changed the\\nface of the earth up to ten miles down so it obliterated the physical\\nevidence of human existence that would speak to the condensing of the\\nGenesis 5 list. However, the Genesis 11 list involves the history of man\\nafter the Flood. To some extent evidence for that history still exists and\\nis constantly being discovered through such disciplines as studies of\\nHebrew and related languages, textual studies, archaeology and ancient Near\\nEast history.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAdding the time represented in the missing generations between Eber and\\nPeleg to the additional 215-years in Egypt provides enough time to\\nencompass all well-established human history as found in written records\\nsince the Flood. Thus, getting the genealogies of Scripture right provides\\nharmony between the words and numbers of Scripture and removes a huge\\nstumbling block between biblical creationists and other Evangelical\\nscholars. (See chapter seven for a full development of the abbreviation of\\nShem\\'s genealogy.)\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe next chapter examines the words of four witnesses to a 430-year sojourn\\nin Egypt. In Archbishop Ussher\\'s day the text of Exodus 12:40 was\\ndeficient; so, for centuries believers held the 215-year view believing\\nthey were standing on Scripture. Over the next two centuries the text was\\nclarified. Now eminent Hebrew scholars are unanimous-Moses clearly said the\\nEgyptian sojourn lasted 430-years. But all along the words of God Himself\\nto Abraham in Genesis 15:13 pointed to a 430-year sojourn in Egypt and\\nexcluded a 215-year sojourn.\\n</p>\\n<br clear=\"all\"/>\\n<p>\\n<strong> </strong>\\n</p>\\n<div>\\n<br clear=\"all\"/>\\n<hr width=\"33%\" size=\"1\" align=\"left\"/>\\n<div id=\"ftn1\">\\n    <p>\\n        <a href=\"#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\" title=\"\">[1]</a>\\n        http://www.bible-researcher.com/chicago1.html\\n    </p>\\n</div>\\n<div id=\"ftn2\">\\n    <p>\\n        <a href=\"#_ftnref2\" name=\"_ftn2\" title=\"\">[2]</a>\\nAndrew E.

Clearly,\\n    the Hebrews abbreviated their genealogies. But this could only be true\\n    if Israel sojourned in Egypt 430-years and the traditional view was\\n    215, not 430-years. God, Moses, Stephen and Paul speak to the issue.\\n    Beyond doubt they testify to a 430-Year Egyptian sojourn. Consequently,\\n    this chapter must examine the testimony of these four in considerable\\n    detail because the past confusion is still bothersome. In the process\\n    it will become apparent why the 215-year option was preferred but is\\n    now obviously incorrect.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    God Himself in Genesis 15 is the first witness. He spoke of 400 years\\n    of affliction but did not name the country where the affliction would\\n    occur. However, He did say Israel would come out of that country in the\\n    4<sup>th</sup> generation. That sounded more like 215-years than 430 to\\n    the traditionalists. The second witness, Moses, wrote about 430-years\\n    but his words could be understood as a total of 430-years between\\n    Canaan and Egypt until a corruption in the text was corrected in modern\\n    times. The third witness, Stephen, quoted God\\'s 400 years so his words\\n    fall in the same camp as God\\'s. The final witness, Paul, quoted Moses\\'\\n    430-years but his words are usually understood to be the total time in\\n    Canaan and Egypt so he was viewed as supporting 215-years.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Josephus, the church fathers, Ussher, the Reformers and the King James\\n    translators all held the 215-year view, but looking back, they were the\\n    victims of historical inaccuracies. Many in the inerrancy camp are\\n    still in this fog. The following will give better material for an\\n    informed view.\\n</p>\\n<h3>\\n    A. The Witness of God-Genesis 15:12-16\\n</h3>\\n<p>\\n    When Abraham was a young man, God was searching for a vessel to greatly\\n    further His work among mankind and begin a line of men who would know\\n    Him. Their descendants would eventually become a nation that declared\\n    His ways and produced both the Bible and the Messiah. The man God\\n    called was Abraham. In the beginning Abraham did not know God. He and\\n    his relatives were idol worshippers. They lived in one of the most\\n    culturally advanced cities on planet earth, but it had forsaken the\\n    knowledge of God.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Even yet, God appeared to him and told him to separate from his\\n    remarkable city, his many relatives, even from his father\\'s house and\\n    follow God to an undisclosed location. If he met those four conditions,\\n    God promised that his name would be great, that he would become a great\\n    nation and that in him all the earth would be blessed. Heady stuff!\\n    Eventually Abraham would fully obey so that God could fulfill His\\n    promises.\\n</p>\\n<h4>\\n    Need for a Covenant\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\n    God cannot lie because His word proceeds from His nature-perfect\\n    righteousness. All His promises to Abraham were real and would happen.\\n    However, the road to becoming a great nation would be incredibly\\n    difficult and take many generations. His descendants would eventually\\n    be reduced to slavery in another land. While the promises were certain,\\n    hardships along the way might lead to despair so God reassured Abraham\\n    as well as his son Isaac and his grandson Jacob with visitation after\\n    visitation, repeating and even expanding the promises.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The visitation in which God disclosed the frightening news that the\\n    path involved 400 years of affliction stood above all others. In\\n    Genesis 15 God made a blood covenant, swearing by Himself alone that no\\n    matter what, He would unconditionally do what He had promised. In the\\n    vision God was saying, \"May I be like the slain animals of the covenant\\n    if I do not keep my word to you.\" There was nothing Abraham or his\\n    descendants could do to produce the results of the covenant except obey\\n    God. Fulfilling the promises would be the supernatural work of God.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    This covenant was given about ten years after Abraham followed God to\\n    the Promised Land. Abraham and his descendants needed to have clearly\\n    in their minds that a time of fearful terror lay ahead. This horrible\\n    period would happen in another land. God would be with them and their\\n    oppression would finally end with them suddenly becoming a great and\\n    wealthy nation. As for Abraham, he would die in peace before this\\n    period of servitude began.\\n</p>\\n<h4>\\n    Setting for the Covenant-Genesis 15:1-11\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\n    Genesis 15 opens with Abraham gripped in fear. The preceding fall he\\n    had rescued Lot from the invasion of four powerful Mesopotamian armies\\n    and slaughtered its soldiers. Now it was the next spring, the time when\\n    armies went on the march. Abraham was scaring himself to death as he\\n    envisioned the certain revenge for which he was no match. In addition,\\n    he had turned his back on the spoils of his victory and was being stung\\n    with criticism for such a foolish act. These thoughts left him in deep\\n    distress.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Then God\\'s word came to Abraham in a vision, saying \"Fear not, Abram. I\\n    am your shield; your reward shall be very great\" (Genesis 15:1). God\\n    was saying that the mightiest army in the world could not harm him\\n    because the God of creation would be his defense. In addition, God\\n    would give him a far greater reward than the spoils of Sodom he\\n    refused.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Abraham had other troubling thoughts. How could he become a nation when\\n    he didn\\'t even have a son? God replied that he would have a son and his\\n    descendants would be like the stars-more numerous than he could number.\\n    Abraham asked how he could be sure this would happen. God told Abraham\\n    to cut in half a heifer, a goat and a ram and lay the halves on either\\n    side of a path. After foretelling key events of the next 700 years God\\n    alone passed between the bloody pieces of the animals thereby signing\\n    the covenant and making Him alone responsible for its fulfillment.\\n</p>\\n<h4>\\n    Terrifying Times Ahead - Genesis 15:12-16\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\n    About dusk, in his vision Abraham fell asleep. Then God made him sense\\n    the horrors his descendants would experience during a future time of\\n    servitude. That nightmare is described in Genesis 15:12 while its\\n    meaning is explained in the next four verses. Abraham\\'s offspring would\\n    be aliens in a foreign country. There they would suffer affliction 400\\n    years. But they would not be destroyed. Instead, they would return to\\n    this Promised Land in great numbers and with great wealth. They could\\n    not take possession of the land yet because others were still entitled\\n    to it. But the land was Abraham\\'s and his descendants by right of\\n    divine promise. As for Abraham, this dark period would not touch him.\\n    He would die in peace. Is this indeed what these verses are saying or\\n    is the traditional explanation to be preferred?\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>\\n        <sup>12</sup>\\n        As the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell on Abram. And behold,\\n        dreadful and great darkness fell upon him. <sup>13</sup>Then the\\n        LORD said to Abram, \"Know for certain that your offspring will be\\n        sojourners in a land that is not theirs and will be servants there,\\n        and they will be afflicted for four hundred years.\" Genesis\\n        15:12-13.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Grouping these two verses together shows the terrifying sense of danger\\n    that came over Abraham and the divine explanation for it. The\\n    traditional viewpoint generally ignores the dread of verse 12 and\\n    begins with God\\'s words in verse 13. But without acknowledging the\\n    overwhelming darkness, any explanation of verse 13 will overlook its\\n    intent. The table below examines God\\'s explanation for the cause of\\n    Abraham\\'s fear. It contains six elements (left column) together with a\\n    reasonable explanation of each element.

They\\nfeel four generations demand a 215-year Egyptian sojourn, so they have no\\nother choice than to wrench some of God\\'s clear statements in verse 13 as\\nwell as verses 14 and 15. Besides all this confusion in attempting a\\nconsistent interpretation, various 215-year supporters give interpretations\\nof verses 13-16 that even disagree with each other. Clearly their\\nexplanation of Genesis 15:12-16 is inconsistent and must be rejected.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBut there is more. God continues&#8230;\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<sup>14</sup>\\n<strong>\\n    But I will bring judgment on the nation that they serve, and afterward\\n    they shall come out with great possessions. <sup>15</sup>As for you,\\n    you shall go to your fathers in peace; you shall be buried in a good\\n    old age. <sup>16</sup>And they shall come back here in the fourth\\n    generation, for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet complete.\\n    Genesis 15:14-16.\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe two assertions of verse fourteen are momentous in their own right. God\\nwould judge the nation that enslaved His people and His people would come\\nforth from that nation with \"great possessions.\" Over 430-years Jacob\\'s\\nsmall band multiplied to a population of several million. Then, when God\\nordered the oppressing nation to free His people which it refused to do, He\\nsent ten devastating plagues of judgment. With that, the oppressors urged\\nHis people to leave before they all perished and sent them away with\\nvaluable gifts. A few days later, the nation had a change of heart and sent\\nits chariot army to bring the Hebrews back. God thwarted this effort by\\ndestroying their military force in the waters of the Red Sea.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAll this happened in the land of Egypt. Egypt was not promised to the\\nHebrews but was the land in which they would become servants, the land\\nwhere they would be afflicted four hundred years. Egypt was the nation God\\nwould judge and its wealth would enrich His people.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nGod spends all of verse 15 with words of assurance to Abraham-he would not\\nendure the grueling slavery destined for his descendants. While it might be\\npossible to argue that verse 13 implies the affliction would touch Abraham\\nas well, God clearly rules out Abraham\\'s participation in this sojourn of\\nservitude with these key phrases: \"As for you,\" \"go to your fathers in\\npeace,\" and \"buried in a good old age.\" In the light of these words, it is\\nhard to understand how the traditional view can insist that Abraham shared\\nin the affliction of verse thirteen.\\n</p>\\n<h4>\\nThree momentous assertions by Jehovah\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    And they shall come back here in the fourth generation, for the\\n    iniquity of the Amorites is not yet complete. Genesis 15:16.\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n1. \"And they shall come back here.\" Hundreds of years of affliction, some\\ninvolving grinding slavery would not annihilate Abraham\\'s descendants. They\\nwould be given the Promised Land just as Jehovah had covenanted.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n2. \"In the fourth generation.\" God did not give a vague promise of a return\\n\"someday.\" This specific time marker would constantly provide hope during\\nthe period of affliction.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n3. \"For the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet complete.\" Amorites\\noccupied the land God promised Abraham. While God is longsuffering, there\\nis a point where a people group has advanced so deeply into sin that hardly\\nanyone in it can get come to know Him. Thus, He must remove that entire\\npeople group. God saw the direction and result of their iniquity. It was\\nheaded towards the place where justice would obligate Him to remove them.\\nOnce their iniquity was complete, they surrendered their right to the land\\nand God was free to give it to others. God would remove the populous\\ncity-state of Sodom just years later for this very reason; there weren\\'t\\neven ten righteous in it. So verse 16 provided another reason for the\\nlengthy stay in Egypt and thus the need for patience until the right time\\narrived.\\n</p>\\n<h4>\\nGenesis 15:16-Fourth Generation Promise\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\nThe statements about returning to Canaan and the Amorites\\' iniquity are\\nclear and understandable but what did God mean by His statement that they\\nwould return in the fourth generation? It means, says the majority view,\\nthe fourth generation of Israelites in Egypt would return to Canaan. They\\nclaim this proves a 215-year Egyptian sojourn and eliminates a 430-year\\nEgyptian sojourn, since four generations could reach 215-years, but not\\n430-years. They point to Exodus six which names four generations ending\\nwith Moses and Aaron who participated in the Exodus (passage cited below).\\nExodus six records that Levi had a son named Kohath. Kohath had a son named\\nAmram and Amram had two sons, Moses and Aaron. The four generations were\\nLevi, Kohath, Amram and Aaron. While this explanation requires strained\\nexplanations for a dozen other details in Genesis 15:12-16 it is the only\\nway, they say.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBut this idea doesn\\'t work because Aaron had four grown sons at the time of\\nthe Exodus. If Levi-Kohath-Amram-Aaron were the right four generations, God\\ndid not keep His promise. To make matters worse Exodus six also names\\nAaron\\'s grandson, Phinehas, who possibly was born in Egypt. Maybe Levi\\'s\\nline came out in the sixth generation. Others have recognized this problem\\nand attempted to identify four other generations, but none work. The fact\\nis, the four generations can\\'t be found if \"fourth generation\" is\\ninterpreted as four consecutive father-son generations. The critical verses\\nare found in Exodus 6:16, 18, 20, 23 and 25:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<sup>16</sup>\\n<strong>\\n    These are the names of the sons of <u>Levi</u> according to their\\n    generations: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari, the years of the life of Levi\\n    being 137 years. <sup>18</sup>The sons of <u>Kohath</u>: Amram, Izhar,\\nHebron, and Uzziel, the years of the life of Kohath being 133 years.        <sup>20</sup><u>Amram</u> took as his wife Jockebed his father\\'s\\n    sister, and she bore him <u>Aaron</u> and Moses, the years of the life\\n    of Amram being 137 years. <sup>23</sup>Aaron took as his wife Elisheba,\\nthe daughter of Amminadab and the sister of Nahshon, and she bore him        <u>Nadab, Abihu</u>, <u>Eleazar, and Ithamar</u>. <sup>25</sup>Eleazar,\\n    Aaron\\'s son, took as his wife one of the daughters of Putiel, and she\\n    bore him <u>Phinehas</u>. (Emphasis ours.)\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n\"Coming out in the fourth generation\" also raises the question, \"How many\\nyears elapsed from the start of one generation to the start of the next?\\nWhile many years elapsed in the generations of Terah, Abraham, Isaac and\\nJacob, beginning with Jacob\\'s sons new generations generally started every\\n20 to 30 years. At that rate four generations would place the deliverance\\nin 80 to 120 years (20x4=80; 30x4=120). Such a time frame even falls short\\nof 215-years in Egypt. Further, God does not say four special generations\\nbut simply four generations. Everyone could count the generations in his\\nfamily and expect deliverance when the number reached four.\\n</p>\\n<h4>\\n\"Generations\" as \"Lifetimes\"\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\nIf a way could be found to harmonize the \"either/or\" verses, it would be a\\n\"both/and\" victory for inerrancy. All the verses and each statement of each\\nverse could be embraced without qualification, without diminishing, without\\nviolating inerrancy. We suggest that way is in a full understanding of the\\nHebrew concept of genealogies. It is much broader than in other cultures.\\nHere the generations would be lifetimes-Israel would come out in four\\nlifetimes, or in the fourth lifetime. Add up four known lifetimes and\\nbefore the end of the fourth, Israel would come out of Egypt.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nMoses wrote these words. He must have puzzled over what God had told\\nAbraham 600 years before. He doesn\\'t identify four successive generations\\n(the 215-year interpretation) but he does provide the numbers to make the\\nidea of \"lifetimes\" work. He lists 40 men in the genealogies of Exodus six\\nbut amazingly he only records the ages of three: Levi-137 years (6:16);\\nKohath-133 years (6:18) and Amram-137 years (6:20). Their ages added\\ntogether total 407 years. In the next chapter Moses wrote, \"Now Moses was\\neighty years old and Aaron eighty-three years old when they spoke to\\nPharaoh\" (Exodus 7:7). Those confrontations produced the Exodus. Adding\\nthose 83 years to the 407 years gives a total of 490 years, which more than\\ncovers a 430-year Egyptian sojourn (137+133+137+83=490). So a perfectly\\nsatisfactory interpretation is that in the total of four lifetimes or in\\nthe fourth lifetime Israel would come out.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThis interpretation allows each of the dozen details in Genesis 15:12-16 to\\nbe taken at face value, in their normal meaning. It completely upholds the\\nprinciple of inerrancy. God had promised the affliction would end at a\\ncertain time and that the outcome would be marvelous. Under this\\ninterpretation the end of Israel\\'s servitude in Egypt would come in just\\nfour lifetimes.\\n</p>\\n<h4>\\nAccepting the Witness of God\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\nGod Himself is the first speaker in Scripture to address the years of\\nsojourn in Egypt. He said Abraham\\'s descendants would be afflicted in a\\nland that was not theirs. Nearly all acknowledge this to be referring to\\nEgypt. He said affliction in that land would continue for 400 years. Since\\n400 years is clearly more than 215-years, God\\'s statement eliminates the\\ntraditional 215-year view. While the 215-year folks quickly fall back to\\nMoses\\' statement about Israel\\'s stay in Egypt in Exodus 12:40, we will show\\nnext that Moses statement does not support their view either.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSome see God\\'s 400-year statement and Moses 430-year statement as a\\nconflict and then imply that it is impossible to know for sure what is\\nbeing said. This conflict is resolved once one recalls that Moses was\\ntalking about Israel\\'s total time in Egypt which began with welcome, while\\nGod was speaking about the portion of time in Egypt after the welcome wore\\noff and was characterized by affliction. The number 400 is also more\\ngeneral and could suggest that the time of affliction was introduced over a\\nperiod of time. God\\'s statement agrees with Moses\\' 430-years statement but\\nrejects a 215-year Egyptian stay.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nGod is not only the first speaker in Scripture to address the issue but He\\nis speaking specifically about the length of time in Egypt. Further, He is\\nthe most important speaker in all of Scripture. In just five words, the\\nfirst five words of Scripture, \"In the beginning God created,\" He settled\\nthe creation/evolution issue. Certainly in five verses He could settle the\\n215/430-year issue. As we shall soon see, the position of the traditional\\nview only seems to worsen.\\n</p>\\n<h3>\\nB. The Witness of Moses-Exodus 12:40-41\\n</h3>\\n<p>\\nSo, how does Moses weigh in on the subject? After all, he was there. Under\\nthe LORD he led Israel out of Egypt. Maybe we have missed something, but\\nhis words seem clear. In Exodus 12:40-41 he states:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<sup>40</sup>\\n<strong>\\nThe time that the people of Israel lived in Egypt was 430-years.        <sup>41</sup>At the end of 430-years, on that very day, all the hosts\\n    of the LORD went out from the land of Egypt.\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe Hebrew text of verse forty was not always clear. In the days of Sir\\nIsaac Newton, Archbishop James Ussher, and the translation of the King\\nJames Version there were long standing questions about the text. The\\nSeptuagint gave the translation \"lived in Egypt and Canaan.\" Josephus took\\nthat view. As a result, the nearly universal view of Christians 400 years\\nago was that the 430-year sojourn included both the years in Canaan and in\\nEgypt. This is where the idea came from that 215 of the 430-year sojourn\\nwere spent in Canaan by Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Newton, Ussher and the\\nKing James translators were all products of their age and expressed the\\nunderstanding of their day.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nOver the next two centuries textual scholars worked to resolve the\\ndifficulties with the text. By the late 1800\\'s Robert Jamieson of the six\\nvolume Jamieson-Fausset-Brown commentary series could say that hardly any\\nHebrew scholar of eminence still accepted the corrupted text that allowed\\nfor understanding that the 430-years spanned the time Abraham and his\\ndescendants lived in the Promised Land and in Egypt.    <a href=\"\" name=\"_ftnref2\" title=\"\">[2]</a> Today even those few eminent\\nHebraists are history. Only the incorrect translation of 1611 and its\\nsuccessors remain to uphold the faulty interpretation. Those who still\\nteach that Israel sojourned in Egypt just 215-years reject hundreds of\\nyears of work to determine the correct text. Today\\'s translations such as\\nthe ESV used in this book (Exodus 12:40 cited above) clearly state that\\nIsrael sojourned in Egypt 430-years.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nMany have unwittingly clung to the incorrect view of Newton and Ussher\\'s\\nday. What are the authorities saying today? US career missionary to Israel\\n[Bill Rogers-over 20 years in Israel and now with Operation Mobilization]\\nanswered our question about what people in Israel believe about the years\\nin Egypt as follows:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    Regarding the 430-years, I have never even heard that this was in\\n    question, as it is accepted universally by Jewish scholars and most\\n    evangelicals too (I thought).

It\\n    is a no brainer to me. Of course I realize that there are all kinds of\\n    higher criticism people who question all of the Bible chronology,\\n    including the timing of the Exodus, but again it seems to me that the\\n    Bible is the final authority and speaks quite clearly on the subject of\\n    timing\\n</strong>\\n.<a href=\"\" name=\"_ftnref3\" title=\"\">[3]</a>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSince the subject is Jewish history, it would seem that of all people\\nliving today, Jews would have the most accurate understanding of their\\nhistory.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nDr. C.F. Keil, co-author of the authoritative 25-volume commentary on the\\nHebrew text of the Old Testament,    <em>Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament,</em> writes as follows about\\nIsrael\\'s time in Egypt:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\nThe sojourn of the Israelites in Egypt had lasted 430-years.        <u>This number is not critically doubtful</u>, nor are the 430-years to\\n    be reduced to 215 by an arbitrary interpolation, such as we find in the\\n    LXX [Septuagint]\\n</strong>\\n.<a href=\"\" name=\"_ftnref4\" title=\"\">[4]</a>    <strong>(Emphasis ours.)</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n\"Not critically doubtful\" means that Hebrew biblical scholars find no\\nsubstantial reason to question 430-years in Egypt. Dr. Keil acknowledges\\nthat lesser texts contain \"arbitrary interpolations\" such as the LXX which\\nreduces this number by adding the interpolation \"and Canaan,\" but that all\\nsuch interpolations should be ignored. They have no bearing on the Hebrew\\ntext. Dr. Keil wrote his commentary over a century ago.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nDr. Thomas Constable, Professor of Bible at Dallas Theological Seminary for\\n45 years and author of the vast web site, soniclight.com with over 8000\\npages of expository notes covering all the books of the Old and New\\nTestament writes this succinct statement:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    <u>The text is very clear</u>\\n    that Israel was in Egypt 430-years \"to the very day.\"\\n</strong>\\n<sup> <a href=\"\" name=\"_ftnref5\" title=\"\">[5]</a> </sup>\\n<strong>(Emphasis ours.)</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSo not only God Himself but also Moses, the greatest instrument of God in\\nproducing the Old Testament, testifies to many more than 215-years in\\nEgypt.\\n</p>\\n<h3>\\nC. The Witness of Stephen-Acts 7\\n</h3>\\n<p>\\nGod\\'s revelation in Genesis 15 was given to Abraham 4000 years ago. Moses\\'\\nrecord in Exodus was prepared 3400 years ago. Long after the words of God\\nand Moses, the New Testament also spoke to the years in Egypt. The church\\'s\\nfirst martyr, Stephen, before being stoned, declared:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<sup>6</sup>\\n<strong>\\n    And God spoke to this effect-that his [Abraham\\'s] offspring would be\\n    sojourners in a land belonging to others, who would enslave them and\\n    afflict them four hundred years. <sup>7</sup>\"But I will judge the\\n    nation that they serve,\" said God, \"and after that they shall come out\\n    and worship me in this place.\" Acts 7:6-7.\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nStephen, \"a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit,\" (Acts 6:5) was\\nciting God\\'s words to Abraham in Genesis 15:13-14. The common elements\\nagree-the subject is Abraham\\'s descendants who would be living as aliens in\\na land God had not promised them; they would be enslaved and this\\naffliction would last 400 years. Stephen unwittingly disclosed that in 2000\\nyears the belief of Jewry had not changed. After all that time they still\\nunderstood God to be saying that the sojourn in Egypt would involve 400\\nyears of affliction.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWe have already seen how the traditional view feels compelled to find other\\nexplanations for God\\'s seemingly clear words to Abraham in Genesis 15. But\\nreinterpreting Stephen\\'s words to mean something else would be very\\ndifficult. So, what does the traditional view do with Stephen\\'s testimony?\\nThey say Acts 7 is exactly what he said. Then they add that inerrancy only\\nguarantees what a person says, not the accuracy of what is said. They say\\nthat this man whom Scripture says was full of the Holy Spirit misspoke. He\\nwas under pressure and/or was confused, so his words cannot necessarily be\\naccepted as factual. On the contrary, Stephen must be added to the\\nwitnesses to a 430-year Egyptian sojourn. Now three consecutive witnesses\\nin Scripture testify to the larger sojourn number.\\n</p>\\n<h3>\\nD. The Witness of Paul-Galatians 3:17\\n</h3>\\n<p>\\nWhile Stephen is the New Testament witness to the 400-year number God gave\\nto Abraham, the Apostle Paul is the New Testament witness to the 430-year\\nnumber given by Moses:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    This is what I mean: the law, which came 430-years afterward, does not\\n    annul a covenant previously ratified by God, so as to make the promise\\n    void. Galatians 3:17.\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWithout question this is the traditional view\\'s favorite verse. \"Here is\\nabsolute proof\" they say, \"that the 430-years began when God first appeared\\nto Abraham and ended with the Exodus.\" They say God made the promises of\\nGenesis 12:1-3 to Abraham when he was living in Haran. He immediately\\nobeyed God\\'s call and moved to Canaan. Then 430-years later the law was\\ngiven at the time of the Exodus. Therefore the 430-years began when Abraham\\nmoved to Canaan and ended with the Exodus. The 430-years consisted of the\\nyears of sojourning in Canaan plus those in Egypt. Since Abraham, Isaac and\\nJacob sojourned in Canaan 215-years, the remaining 215-years was the time\\nof sojourning in Egypt.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe traditional view cites Paul\\'s authority. Because he wrote more of the\\nNew Testament than any other writer and his books contain the heart of\\nChristian doctrine, he outranks all other writers of Scripture. If there is\\nsome confusion between the Old Testament and the Apostle, one must prefer\\nthe Apostle. They suggest that possibly the Old Testament isn\\'t clear, but\\nthe Apostle is perfectly clear and he is the final authority. Thus, the\\ntraditional view stands with the Apostle-the entire sojourn in Canaan and\\nEgypt lasted 430-years, period, end of discussion.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWhen this view leads the discussion, it doesn\\'t start with the very words\\nof the LORD Himself in Genesis 15, but immediately starts with Galatians\\n3:17 and then reinterprets the words of Stephen, Moses and Jehovah to agree\\nwith Paul. But which is better: to start with the primary sources, Jehovah\\nand Moses, then work to the secondary sources in the New Testament, or\\nstart with one secondary source, work on the other secondary source and\\nthen rework the primary sources?\\n</p>\\n<h4>\\nReconciling Paul with God, Moses and Stephen\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\nNevertheless, every knowing Christian takes very seriously what the Apostle\\nwrote. What, then, are we to do with Paul\\'s words? First we should observe\\nthat the subject of both God and of Moses was the number of years in Egypt;\\nStephen and Paul were addressing other subjects. Stephen\\'s point was that\\nIsrael\\'s leaders historically rejected God\\'s messengers. So he specifically\\nquoted God\\'s words to Abraham as he reminded his hearers that God had\\nraised up the nation to sovereignly accomplish His will even though His\\nwill was constantly resisted.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nPaul, like Stephen, was not discussing how many years Israel sojourned in\\nEgypt. He was showing that God\\'s grace preceded God\\'s Law. In his argument\\nHe cited a number every Jew would know-the 430-year number. It was repeated\\nannually in the Passover celebration. Paul\\'s point was that the Law did not\\nfinally make a way for man to have a right relationship with God. God dealt\\nwith the forefathers of Israel in grace from the beginning, long before the\\nlaw. That grace is seen in the promises and covenant God gave to Abraham,\\nIsaac and Jacob. All this promise/covenant development happened 430-years\\nbefore God gave Israel the Law.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIf there was no standing before God until the Law, the promises were\\nmeaningless and all the Jewish people who lived before the giving of the\\nlaw missed out on a right relationship with God. The 430-year number was a\\npowerful argument for grace rather than law. Yet the Galatian believers\\nwere being told that they needed to keep the Mosaic Law to enjoy God\\'s\\nblessings. So, Paul argued that God established promises and a covenant\\nwith Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Then 430-years later He gave the Law. In\\nthis way, Paul agrees with God, Moses and Stephen in supporting 430-years\\nin Egypt.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIt should also be noted that since God\\'s and Moses\\' core subject was the\\ntime in Egypt while Stephen\\'s and Paul\\'s core subjects were other matters,\\nGod and Moses should be preferred over Stephen and Paul. But since\\nStephen\\'s words agree with God\\'s words, only Paul can be viewed to be at\\nodds with the other three. Rather than working on the words of the other\\nthree witnesses, many of which are not subject to another interpretation,\\nshouldn\\'t the first consideration be, \"Can Paul\\'s rather general words can\\nbe understood in another light?\"\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nProceeding on that basis-one insight would be Paul\\'s reference to covenant.\\nGod did not give Abraham a covenant when He called him. The covenant was\\nnot made until Abraham had been in the land about ten years-shortly before\\nAbraham took Hagar to give Sarah a child. If Paul were talking about the\\ntime from the Covenant to the Law, he should have said 420 years, not\\n430-years. On the other hand if the call came to Abraham when he was living\\nin Ur, not when his father died in Haran, then the time from the call to\\nthe Law would have been greater than 430-years. (The next chapter shows\\nthat the call came in Ur, not Haran.)\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBut Paul is not speaking about Abraham\\'s call. He is speaking about the\\npromises which foreshadow Jesus Christ and the salvation God would provide\\nthrough Him. These promises were amplified over time to Abraham, then to\\nhis son Isaac and finally to his grandson Jacob. They were sworn to by God\\nHimself in the covenant of Genesis 15.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nJoseph invited his father to move to Egypt where there was food because\\nfive years of famine remained. Jacob accepted. He took his household as far\\nas Beersheba in Southern Israel, but then he hesitated. Previously it had\\nnot been God\\'s will for him, his father or grandfather to leave the\\nPromised Land. Jacob offered sacrifices. In a vision God gave him assurance\\nto continue to Egypt.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong><sup>1</sup></strong>\\n<strong>\\n    So Israel took his journey with all that he had and came to Beersheba,\\n    and offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac. <sup> 2</sup>And\\n    God spoke to Israel in visions of the night and said, \"Jacob, Jacob.\"\\n    And he said, \"Here I am.\" <sup>3</sup>Then he said, \"I am God, the God\\n    of your father. Do not be afraid to go down to Egypt, for there I will\\n    make you into a great nation. <sup>4</sup>I myself will go down with\\n    you to Egypt, and I will also bring you up again, and Joseph\\'s hand\\n    shall close your eyes.\" Genesis 46:1-4.\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIn this passage God restates and amplifies the promises for the final time\\nbefore the sojourn in Egypt. On this night the promise-making period that\\nbegan with God\\'s call to Abraham concluded; the next day Jacob moved his\\npeople to Egypt. So the promises were given, restated and expanded over\\nmore than 215-years. After the promises (this promise-making period) came\\nthe 430-year sojourn in Egypt. Following this came the giving of the Law at\\nMount Sinai. Thus sandwiched in between the development of the promises and\\nthe giving of the Law were those 430-years in Egypt. First came years of\\nmaking the promises/covenant. Then came the 430-year sojourn in Egypt.\\nFollowing that God gave Israel the Law at Mount Sinai. Thus, from the [end\\nof the] promise and covenant making period to the law was precisely\\n430-years. Paul was not contradicting the words of Moses but was actually\\nconfirming them. This interpretation fits perfectly with the testimonies of\\nthe other three witnesses.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSo which is better? To make Paul\\'s words of a very general nature to agree\\nwith the specific words of the other three witnesses or to make all the\\nwords of the three witnesses agree with one interpretation of when the\\n430-years in Paul\\'s statement began? Logically, the first approach seems\\npreferable. Thus, it is sound hermeneutics to understand that Paul\\'s words\\nagree with those of God, Moses and Stephen. The New Testament confirms the\\nwords of God in Stephen\\'s message to the leaders of Israel and the words of\\nMoses in Paul\\'s argument to the Galatians. In contrast to the traditional\\n215-year view, the Bible gives no less than four passages to emphasize that\\nit was 430-years that Israel sojourned in Egypt. All the statements and\\nnumbers in these four passages are harmonized without conflict. Inerrancy\\nis honored.\\n</p>\\n<h4>\\nPath to Violating Scripture\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\nIn retrospect, where did the practice of preferring numbers to words begin?\\nAs stated in the previous chapter, it all began when people, thinking they\\nwere taking the Bible literally, added the numbers in Levi\\'s line and\\nrealized that Amram could not possibly be the immediate father of Aaron if\\nIsrael were in Egypt 430-years. They eventually concluded the 430-years\\nreferred to the entire time from Abraham\\'s arrival in Canaan until the\\nExodus. That left just 215-years in Egypt. It was possible for Amram to be\\nthe immediate father of Aaron if Israel were in Egypt just 215-years. But\\nunfortunately, the obvious meaning of many other words of Scripture would\\nneed to be reinterpreted in difficult and unnatural ways.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWhy do all that to Scripture when it is clear that Hebrew genealogies can\\nbe as narrow as Adam begetting Cain or as broad as Jesus being the son of\\nDavid? When one recognizes the nature and function of Hebrew genealogies,\\nthe record of Amram begetting Aaron is obviously a skipping of multiple\\ngenerations. It is the broad sense of Amram being a forefather of Aaron, of\\nAaron coming from the loins of Amram. Once this is understood, the\\nScriptures become whole, no contradictions, no errors, no explaining away\\nclear verses, no ignoring difficult verses.\\n</p>\\n<h4>\\nConclusion Number One: Israel Dwelt in Egypt 430-years\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\nThe debate over whether Israel dwelt in Egypt 430 or 215-years is not\\nbetween those who accept the Bible and those who question the Bible. Both\\nsides believe the Bible is inerrant and the final authority. Motive\\ndistinguishes the two positions. 430-years didn\\'t work with an uninformed\\nview of the genealogies, so long ago the traditional view found a way to\\ncut the 430-years down to 215. Today, the typical Evangelical Christian has\\nnever heard the 215-year view taught or even talked about. When he reads\\nabout those who reduce the 430-year Egyptian sojourn, he is shocked. He\\nasks, \"How could anyone who claims to honor Scripture treat it with such\\ncallousness?\"\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nHe might even reexamine what Scripture actually says and find that four\\nauthors address the subject. The first author is no less than God Himself\\nwho promised to make Abraham a great nation but warned that the path to\\nnationhood would involve exploitation and servitude. To give hope God\\nrevealed that difficult time would end in 400 years. Centuries later Moses\\nwrote a description of the deliverance from Egypt and said that the\\ndeliverance came 430-years to the day after Israel went down to Egypt.\\nWhile God\\'s 400 years only spoke about the affliction time in Egypt, he\\nwould realize that Moses\\' 430-years referred to the entire time in Egypt\\nwhich included a period at the beginning when Jacob\\'s family was given good\\nland and was not afflicted. Thus, the two periods, 400 and 430, were\\nactually the overall period and then a period within the overall period.\\nThey were true periods, each supporting the other. Thus, no less than God\\nand Moses attested to 430-years in Egypt.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nHe comes to the New Testament which states both the 400 year and 430-year\\nnumbers. Stephen rehearsed Israel\\'s history and quoted God\\'s statement\\nabout 400 years of affliction in a land belonging to others while Paul\\ncited Moses 430-year statement as the time from the making of promises and\\ncovenant to the giving of the Mosaic Law during the first year of\\nwilderness wandering. Thus he finds that both the Old and New Testaments\\nattest to 430-years in Egypt. With his study completed, he concludes,\\n\"Certainly the testimony of these authorities should be adequate. If not,\\nhow can a Christian trust anything Scripture says?\"\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nMotivation also tests the two interpretations. True motivation attempts to\\ndetermine what the passages in question say. The 430 view is motivated by\\nthis desire while the 215 view is motivated by a desire to reduce the\\n430-years in some way. If there are compelling reasons to understand a\\npassage in some other way than its normal meaning, it may be necessary to\\nexplore the subject passages in unconventional ways. But if not, such\\ntampering must be avoided. The 215-year view has no such compelling reason.\\nFour hundred thirty years is not harmful to Scripture. Instead, it is\\nbeneficial because it forces the interpreter to take the genealogies as\\nthey were meant to be taken. Finally, while four authors support the\\n430-year number, nowhere does a single author of Scripture suggest or imply\\nIsrael was in Egypt only 215-years.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWhile trying to avoid being dogmatic, we are stating what appears to most\\nto be obvious. It appears that beyond question Israel\\'s sojourn in Egypt\\nlasted 430-years. To say otherwise is to teach something the Scripture\\nsimply never says and to deny what the Scripture says multiple times. Two\\nhundred fifteen and years dishonors Scripture. It is not the way that\\ninerrancy treats Scripture. Once a person has a clear understanding of the\\nfour witnesses\\' testimonies, a 430-year sojourn in Egypt can no longer be\\ndisputed.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThis 430-year number is like a brick wall. All those who throw themselves\\nagainst it only injure themselves while the wall stands. Hopefully they\\nwill give glory to God who has revealed clearly a 430-year sojourn in Egypt\\nand abandon this longstanding distraction.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nA 430-year Egyptian sojourn would seemingly push Ussher\\'s date for the\\nFlood back 215-years, from 2348 BC to 2563 BC (in truth it doesn\\'t because\\nof other errors). This will make the historians and archaeologists a little\\nhappier since they find much human activity during that span. However, if\\nthe people who emphasize numbers over words in Scripture have made other\\nerrors in their calculations, the 2563 BC number will need further\\ncorrecting.\\n</p>\\n<h4>\\nConclusion Number Two: Genealogies May be Abbreviated\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\nChapter one showed that a 430-year sojourn in Egypt would require\\nunderstanding that the Levi-Aaron line of Exodus chapter six was\\nabbreviated. This chapter shows that beyond doubt Israel did sojourn in\\nEgypt 430-years. These two facts raise two alternatives: either the Bible\\nis in error at this point or the Levi-Aaron genealogy is abbreviated. The\\nfirst alternative is both unacceptable and unnecessary. Therefore, the only\\nother alternative must be accepted: their genealogy is selective rather\\nthan comprehensive.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSuch a conclusion is a stumbling block to some. But it need not be. When\\nthey examine the many ways Scripture uses genealogies, they will realize\\nthat Exodus six acceptably and accurately uses Hebrew genealogies. This\\ninsight will be a momentous advance for those who cherish Scripture as\\nGod-breathed.\\n</p>\\n<h4>\\nLooking Ahead\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\nGod, Moses, Stephen, Paul-four witnesses. Are four enough? In Deuteronomy\\n17:6 the very life of a person rested in the hands of just two or three\\nwitnesses. If someone turned to idolatry God said to put them to death on\\nthe evidence of two or three witnesses. This principle regarding the\\nrequired number of witnesses to establish a fact carried through to the New\\nTestament church. Paul said that two or three witnesses were necessary to\\nestablish a charge against an elder (I Timothy 5:19). The testimony of four\\nwitnesses more than meets the biblical requirement for establishing the\\ntruth.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nHaving established by four witnesses that Israel dwelt in Egypt 430-years\\nand therefore the Levi-Aaron genealogy of Exodus six is abbreviated, our\\ninitial goal has been reached. While we could end here, some may still\\nbelieve Abraham\\'s call came in Haran and therefore three witness for\\n430-years while one witnesses for 215-years. We will next examine extensive\\nevidence for that call coming in Ur, not Haran, leaving all four witnesses\\nsolidly in the 430-year Egyptian sojourn camp. Then we will take a careful\\nlook at Jacob\\'s life to correct details which have also been altered to fit\\nthe numbers over words approach. In effect this book provides a fresh look\\nat some of the key moments in the lives of Abraham and Jacob, a prize for\\nthose wanting to correct mistaken notions regarding aspects of their lives.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nOnce these interpretations are addressed, we can get to the heart of this\\npaper, a look at the nature and function of Hebrew genealogies. Chapter\\nfive addresses how family relationship words can be used in both narrow and\\nbroad senses; chapter six gives numerous examples of condensed genealogies\\nand chapter seven provides many evidences for Shem\\'s line (Genesis 11)\\nbeing condensed. And so it goes. Hold on to your hats.

For his words to have this meaning, God's call\\nhad to come when Abraham was living in Haran, a position that is fatally\\nflawed. Such an idea comes both from misinterpreting the Scriptural record\\nof certain events and oversimplifying how God was preparing Abraham for a\\nlife of faith. Yet the subject is complex and is not settled with a few\\nsimple proof texts.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThis chapter begins by noting the many contributions to Abraham's total\\nlife story in those first 75 years overlooked by Ussher and his followers.\\nIn the process most readers will gain an entirely new appreciation for this\\none whom God used to found the Jewish people and birth our Savior. Those\\nyears were not unlike the early years of Moses, Paul, Joseph and David\\nwhose stops and starts laid groundworks for their future ministries.\\nUnderstanding these puts flesh on the bones of Abraham's life of growing\\nfaith. Although sinning and doubting along the way, this man who worshipped\\nidols in Ur with his kindred, (Joshua 24:2) came to build altars to the one\\nand only true God in Haran so that when he arrived in Canaan his first\\nresponse was to build an altar (Genesis 12:7-8). How did that happen?\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWhen the call came in Ur, even Abraham's idolatrous father must have been\\nawed by his son's claims that if he followed the true God's leading, God\\nwould make of him a great nation and in him all the families of the earth\\nwould be blessed (Genesis 12:2-3). Apparently once Terah realized that he\\ncould not talk his son out of this insane plan to walk away from his life\\nin Ur, he began to wonder if maybe God did appear to him after all. Terah\\nhad taken delight in his son's impressive achievements in Ur and had the\\nstrongest confidence in this only son still in his household. In the end,\\nwith his final years looming, his only option was to accompany his son\\nalthough some of this remains a mystery. We can only surmise but history\\npoints to difficult times ahead for Ur. God often uses circumstances in His\\nleading. Perhaps in this case the winds of war were already in the air.\\nWhew, away from that!\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAlong the journey the family most likely questioned Abraham: what next? God\\nhad said \\\"to go to the land that I will show you\\\" (Genesis 12:1). Hebrews\\n11:8 concurs:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to a place that he\\n    was to receive as an inheritance. And he went out, not knowing where he\\n    was going.\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIn a way not explained by Scripture God was showing Abraham where to go\\njust as He had said. At each fork somehow God led him. As they journeyed\\nfrom Ur Abraham confidently told his party whether to go left, right or\\nstraight ahead. Because this went on for nearly two months Abraham's party\\nmust have felt better and better about the move with each passing day. Then\\nsuddenly about 700 miles from Ur Abraham didn't know which way to go.\\nWhatever method God used to lead him stopped, vanished, disappeared into\\nthin air. So there they waited and waited. Not a sign, not a hint from God.\\nFinally, after some days, heavy with disappointment, they began to discuss\\nwhat went wrong. Abraham knew-while he had separated from his country and\\nrelatives, he had not separated from his father's idolatrous household. Now\\nwhat?\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe decision was made to settle in Haran. Scripture doesn't tell how far\\nHaran was from where the leading stopped but it does report that \\\"when they\\ncame to Haran, they settled there\\\" (Genesis 11:31) even though they\\neventually learned that the destination was Canaan. After all this divine\\nleading and the visitation that triggered it, Abraham would never be the\\nsame. Now he knew there was a great difference between the idolatrous gods\\nof Ur and the true God who spoke to him in Ur and led him as far as Haran.\\nHe must know this true God. Information was available to those so motivated\\nand Abraham began to gather that information and seek this God. With the\\npassing of time he began to worship this true God. He began to build altars\\nas those before him who worshipped the true God had done.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nFor the next 10 or 15 years Abraham got to know the true God better and\\nbetter and worshiped at the altar more and more frequently. This in itself\\nis remarkable but another remarkable thing began to happen. The members of\\nTerah's household began joining Abraham at the altar. Eventually,\\napparently Terah's entire household worshiped at the altar. He was in his\\nfinal days and now totally dependent on his son. Very possibly before the\\nend he also joined with the others at Abraham's altar. Oh, how marvelous\\nwas the grace of God in allowing this family situation to play out in Haran\\nover those years.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe proof for all this is the large evidence of faith demonstrated by\\nAbraham's household once they reached Canaan-immediately worshipping at\\naltars upon arrival, ascribing faith to Lot (II Peter 2:7), choosing for\\nHebron and the suicidal mission of rescuing Lot from the invasion of the\\nMesopotamian armies.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Abraham's Place in the Birth Order of Terah's Sons</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nPiecing together those 75 years before the move to Canaan requires solving\\nthe issue of birth order of Terah's three sons. Stephen said that Abraham\\nmoved to Canaan after Terah died (Acts 7:4). He died at the age of 205\\n(Genesis 11:32). Since Abraham arrived in Canaan at the age of 75 (Genesis\\n12:4), he was born when Terah was 130 years old (205-75=130). Because Terah\\nbegan fathering his three sons when he was 70, Abraham had a brother who\\nwas 60 years his senior (130-70=60).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBut Abraham is generally considered the oldest son. Twice Scripture names\\nTerah's three sons and in both cases the order is Abraham, Nahor and Haran\\n(Genesis 11:26, 27). People assume the sons are named in the order of their\\nbirth. While this is the normal practice of Scripture, sometimes it names\\nsons in the order of their importance or impact in the plan of God. Such is\\nthe case here. Abraham would touch the entire world. Nahor would supply\\nwives to Abraham's descendants. Haran died in relative obscurity. As to why\\nthe three brothers were born over a period of 60 years, Terah apparently\\nhad a fertility problem. This explanation seems reasonable because his\\ndaughter Sarah was barren, his granddaughter Rebekah also was barren and\\neven his great-granddaughter Rachel was barren.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAs to the ages of Abraham's two brothers, Nahor and Haran, Scripture\\nprovides important hints to work with. First, Nahor married Haran's\\ndaughter Milcah. Second, Haran's name suggests Terah enjoyed business\\nsuccess at the trade route town by that name before moving to Ur. Third,\\nHaran died before Abraham left Ur. These three details point to Haran being\\nolder than Nahor. When was Nahor born? He had eight sons by Haran's\\ndaughter and was no longer living with his father when God called Abraham.\\nFurther Abraham was attached to Lot, the son of Haran, not his brother\\nNahor. These details indicate Nahor would have been 30 or 40 years older\\nthan Abraham. Now a possible picture emerges: Haran was born when Terah was\\n70. Nahor was born 20-40 years later. Abraham was the youngest brother,\\nborn 60 years after Haran.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nMore details emerge. Abraham married his father's daughter by a second\\nwife. Sarah was ten years younger than Abraham. They were married long\\nenough in Ur to discover that unlike her sister-in-law, she was barren.\\nThis seems to indicate that Abraham lived many adult years in Ur. The age\\nfor adulthood was 25 at the time. Possibly Abraham married Sarah once she\\nreached that age. Then, 25-30 years of marriage would be adequate to\\nrealize that Sarah could not have children and would place the call of God\\nwhen Abraham was 60 or 65. If so, Haran died by the age of 130 or 135 and\\nTerah was 190 or 195. Living 35-40 adult years in Ur allowed Abraham to\\nlearn and achieve much and drink deeply from Ur's culture while 10-15 years\\nof mature adult life in Haran would have been enough time to become wealthy\\nboth materially and spiritually.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Nephew Older Than Uncle</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWith Lot's father 60 years older than Abraham and Lot's sister marrying\\nAbraham's other brother, Lot himself must have been some years older than\\nAbraham. Does this fit the context? Actually, Lot being older than Abraham\\nmakes better sense of what Scripture reveals of their relationship. One\\ngets the impression that Abraham was more attached to Lot than Lot was to\\nAbraham which would be expected if Lot were older than Abraham.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAbraham's real older brother, Nahor, was preoccupied with a growing family.\\nMeanwhile Lot continued to live in the household of his grandfather. So\\nLot, not Nahor, became the \\\"big brother\\\" figure in Abraham's life. This\\nbonding would be a new explanation for why Abraham was so loyal to him and\\nwould also explain why Abraham offered Lot first choice of the land when\\nthey separated (Genesis 13). It would further explain how Lot could go his\\nseparate way and seek out Sodom rather than staying close to Abraham. He\\nthought for himself. He had his own views. He did what he pleased. In\\nsummary, if Lot were the elder, he would have been something of a big\\nbrother in Abraham's childhood and this early relationship colored\\nAbraham's relationship with him in adulthood.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAs to Terah, he was becoming infirm and dependent on others. His oldest son\\nwas dead and the other was living on his own. Abraham was the only son left\\nto care for him when God's call came. As it played out, this youngest son\\nand his daughter cared for Terah until his death. These also became the\\nobvious heirs to Terah's household along with Lot who must have received an\\ninheritance in place of his father who was the oldest son. This would also\\nexplain where Lot got the vast herds that forced him and Abraham to\\nseparate shortly after arriving in Canaan.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Life in Ur</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nOf all the cities on the face of the earth in which to live in Abraham's\\nday, Ur would have won top honors. It was the Paris of its time, even more\\nadvanced than any city in Egypt, leading in wealth, education, security,\\ncomfort and pleasure. Standing at the head of the Persian Gulf, it\\ncontrolled the mouth of the Euphrates. Thousands of tablets have been\\nrecovered from the site that reflect this period. Numerous royal graves\\nwere found unrobbed and filled with historical artifacts. The temple\\ncomplex housed a school. Sir Leonard Woolley excavated the levels of Ur\\nfrom 1922-1934 and learned from student work tablets the extensive\\nknowledge taught its youth, even high school level math. Consequently, the\\nfree population was both intelligent and well educated. The monarchy and\\nthe worship of the moon god were unifying institutions.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nArchaeologists report that most of Ur's population consisted of\\nservants/slaves. If 90% were not completely free and the country's total\\npopulation numbered 250,000, then only 25,000 were actual citizens.\\nAbraham's kin could have numbered in the hundreds and wielded a significant\\ninfluence within the free population. About Abraham's time Ur had a\\npowerful and successful army. At one point it was the dominant force in\\nMesopotamia, establishing hegemony all the way up the Euphrates to the\\nMediterranean. Free citizens made up the higher echelons. If Abraham had\\nfollowed a military career, he would have studied military science and\\nworked up to a significant command position. Whether or not the military\\nwas his career, his military savvy shines in the following event.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>The Campaign of Four Mesopotamian Armies</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIn an astonishing military victory Abraham defeated a coalition of four\\nMesopotamian armies some nine years after he arrived in Canaan. After\\nserving the King of Elam 12 years the population center where Lot moved\\nrebelled. Scripture is clear about the military force that retaliated\\n(Genesis 14:1-16)-its size, objective and success. The king, Chedorlaomer,\\nbrought his army from Elam, an area to the east of Lower Mesopotamia,\\ntoday's southwestern Iran. These people were later called Persians. After\\nAbraham followed God to Haran, Chedorlaomer's country defeated Ur and\\ndestroyed the city. This is well-known in secular history. In short order\\nElam extended its governance all the way to the Sodom-Gomorrah region. Now\\nits present ruler came with three allies-Amraphel king of Shinar (Babylon),\\nArioch king of Ellasar (Larsa, longtime rival of Ur) and Tidal, king of\\nNations (apparently from Upper Mesopotamia).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThese four kings controlled an enormous area, from Upper Mesopotamia to\\nwell beyond Lower Mesopotamia, 500 to 1500 miles distant from Sodom. One\\ncommentator suggested this force could have numbered 100,000 soldiers.\\nTheir columns stretched for miles. As they left the Euphrates and marched\\nsouthwest towards Sodom, raiders from the badlands to the east fell upon\\ntheir columns and supply lines. Distracted from their original mission they\\nbegan fighting people group after people group to the east of their route\\n(Genesis 14:5). Eventually they fought all the way to Eilat at the head of\\nthe Gulf of Aqaba (Genesis 14:6).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nTurning west they encountered and defeated the desert people that occupied\\nthe lands south of Sodom (Genesis 14:7). Finally, they reached their\\nobjective, attacking the Sodomites but apparently in a surprise maneuver\\nonly hinted at in Scripture. The defenders expected the enemy to approach\\nfrom the south but seem to have been pinned against the bitumen pits. This\\nwould point to an unexpected and unexplained backdoor route descending the\\nhills to the west and only lightly guarded by the defenders. In this battle\\nthe consortium utterly crushed the five kings that governed the heavily\\npopulated Sodom-Gomorrah civilization bowl. With no opposition remaining,\\nthe victors began the long march home loaded with plunder and the\\npopulation whom they would sell into slavery. Abraham's \\\"big brother\\\" was\\nheaded for a miserable future.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Abraham's Private Army</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAn escapee brought the bad news to Abraham who immediately gathered his\\nforces to free Lot. The odds at this point appeared to be 100 to 1. This\\nwas certain suicide, unless Abraham was a military genius. Scripture\\nsuggests as much, relating that Abraham \\\"led forth his trained men, born in\\nhis house, 318 of them.\\\" (Genesis 14:14). Abraham had his own private army.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nUntil now Scripture had said nothing about Abraham training his servants\\nfor combat. From what happens in the battle one must conclude that they had\\nmilitary skills equal to the invaders who were professional soldiers,\\nbattle hardened after an unexpectedly difficult possibly year-and-a-half\\nlong campaign. With Abraham about 84 years old the youngest of his fighters\\nwould have been born when Abraham was 64 years old or 11 years before he\\nleft Haran for Canaan. The fact that they were born in his house indicates\\nhe began their training at an early age and that this practice had been\\ngoing on for many years.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWhat did these trained fighters look like? As a general over his army\\nAbraham trained them to handle lethal weapons and kill. His forces knew how\\nto work together to overcome far superior forces. They were cunning, strong\\nand had tremendous endurance. Where could Abraham possibly have gained this\\nmilitary knowledge? You guessed it-in Ur. During his early years in Ur its\\narmy was having great success. Now he had an army like Ur's in his very own\\nhousehold. His men could face the best from Mesopotamia. Would it be too\\nmuch to say Abraham's 318 were among the best soldiers alive in their day?\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Abraham's Amorite Confederates</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nEven more remarkable, Abraham had Amorite confederates who joined this\\nsuicidal venture. Why? They had to have confidence in Abraham's knowledge\\nof warfare. This explains another mystery. Why would the Amorites share\\ntheir land with Abraham in the first place? Shortly after arriving in\\nCanaan the range land proved insufficient for Abraham's and Lot's cattle so\\nthey separated. Lot set his tent towards Sodom while Abraham moved to\\nHebron. What Scripture doesn't explain is that Hebron was the highest\\nground in Israel, even higher than Jerusalem which is a half mile above sea\\nlevel. It was one of the most out of the way and defensible locations\\nAbraham could choose. Furthermore, it had limited access. It was at a dead\\nend. Abraham literally took the high ground. But it was occupied by\\nAmorites. So while this act displays great military savvy, how would the\\nAmorites ever be persuaded to share their land with him?\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nFirst, Abraham proved to be a diplomat and a business man. Somehow, he\\nshowed them that his presence would be to their advantage. Second, he must\\nhave shared his military experiences from Ur. The Amorites had never heard\\nsuch things. They were impressed. His fighters and the Amorite fighters\\nwould have contests. Abraham's were superior. Abraham began telling them\\nhow he trained his fighters. They formed a mutual defense alliance. Over a\\nfive or six year period the Amorites greatly increased their military\\nskills and came to have unflagging confidence in Abraham.\\n</p>\\n<p align=\\\"center\\\">\\n<strong>A Military Victory for the Books</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nNow Lot and his family were prisoners. Abraham loved his nephew and saw his\\ninterest in the true God (\\\"righteous Lot\\\" II Peter 2:7). But what chance\\ndid Abraham have against the ocean of invaders? Again, his knowledge of\\nwarfare. He would know that once the invader's campaign was successful, the\\nkings and most of their soldiers would head for home at top speed. At a\\nmuch slower pace a small but adequate force would return with the vast\\nplunder and the many slaves. Possibly only 5,000 to 10,000 soldiers\\nremained, but still the odds were five or ten to one.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBut Abraham had one more ace up his sleeve. He knew that discipline would\\nbe almost non-existent now that the army had vanquished all opposition. The\\ncoalition had been fighting for over a year. This was a time to celebrate\\nand those celebrations typically came in the form of nightly drunken orgies\\nat the expense of the female prisoners. Apparently even nighttime\\nreconnaissance patrols were neglected. From his days in Ur Abraham\\nunderstood the various plans for night watches, passwords, trumpet signals,\\ncommand structure, and camp layout. He also knew the typical contingency\\nplans for night attacks. In other words, he knew the military science of\\nSouthern Mesopotamia. Further, he and senior members of his household knew\\nthe various languages of Mesopotamia and could use those languages to get\\ninside the enemy's defenses. Further yet, he had grazed his flocks for\\nyears through the entire area and knew every trail like the back of his\\nhand. Undoubtedly he sent scouts ahead to gather intelligence. HHHHere in\\nabbreviated fashion is the scriptural account:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    And he divided his forces against them by night, he and his servants,\\n    and defeated them and pursued them to Hobah, north of Damascus. Genesis\\n    14:15.\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAbraham's plan was to strike in a night attack from multiple directions.\\nThis plan employed a major strategy of military science-surprise. But it\\nalso violated two principles-attacking at night and dividing one's force\\nagainst a superior force. It was very, very risky. There would be either\\ngreat reward or great loss. Abraham was the overall commander with three\\nAmorite bands taking orders from him. Possibly his force numbered 600-700.\\nAbraham and senior officers had to have gone over the plan in great detail.\\nThey caught up with the invaders where the city of Dan would later be\\nestablished on the northern boundary of Israel about 110 air miles north of\\nHebron. The forced march could hardly have been accomplished in four\\nexhausting days. Along the way they encountered injured and dead prisoners\\nand a trail of their discarded possessions. By the time they reached Dan,\\nthough exhausted, they were highly motivated.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAbraham's night attack was a complete success. He could have found wounded\\nor dead soldiers along the way and taken their uniforms to dress some of\\nhis troops to infiltrate their lines. Perhaps he impersonated a commander\\nof the invaders and gave guards contradictory orders, using his mastery of\\nthe languages of Lower Mesopotamia and his intimate knowledge of their\\nmilitary operations. Whatever strategy he used, he utterly surprised and\\nrouted the invaders. He drove the fleeing confederation fifty miles, to a\\nplace called Hobah somewhere north of Damascus. He knew that if the army\\nregrouped and counterattacked it would all be over for him and his allies.\\nNo enemy soldier could be spared; it was either complete victory or\\neventual disaster. Even one escapee could provide the information needed\\nfor a retaliatory strike the next year.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<em>HB</em>\\nhas Col. R. B. Thieme Jr. to thank for many of the above insights. Col.\\nThieme's military genius was followed by international Bible teaching from\\nstudying the original languages of Scripture. Thieme served his country in\\nWorld War II, becoming the youngest man ever, up to that point, to make\\nfull colonel in the US Army. After the war he graduated from Dallas\\nTheological Seminary in 1950 (Th.M.) with the intention of entering the DTS\\nHebrew doctoral program in the Fall. That summer found him as the interim\\npulpit supply at Berachah Church in Houston Texas where he was made pastor\\nand served that church until 2004, maintaining a unique schedule of seven\\nhours of Bible teaching at his church weekly. Tapes of those studies\\ncircled the globe.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Abraham's Best Defense</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe next spring when armies go to war found Abraham knotted up in fear.\\nThis would be the time when the Mesopotamians would return to wreak\\nvengeance on him and his neighbors. Where does this idea come from? The\\nvery next chapter records how God appeared to him in a vision and said,\\n\\\"Fear not, Abram. I am your shield; your reward shall be very great.\\\"\\n(Genesis 15:1). Abraham had dared to strike the flower of Mesopotamia. Now\\nhe feared the worst. But he did not have to fear because the God of\\ncreation would be his shield. Further, apparently he was having second\\nthoughts about having lifted up his hand \\\"to the LORD God Most High,\\nPossessor [Creator] of heaven and earth, &#8230;not to take a thread or a\\nsandal strap or anything that [belonged to Sodom] lest [the king of Sodom]\\nshould say, 'I have made Abram rich'\\\" Genesis 14:22-23. Had that been the\\nright thing to do? Yes, because for that stand God promised that his reward\\nwould be <strong>very</strong> great.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>75 Years of Preparation in Ur and Haran </strong>\\n(see also Appendix 3.4)<strong></strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAbraham's military skills point to many adult years in Ur, not the sleepy\\nvillage of Urfa 25 miles northwest of Haran while his altars point to years\\nof growing closer to the LORD in Haran. During the Haran years Terah's\\ninfluence waned while Abraham's influence grew. The vast numbers of\\nAbraham's cattle when he separated from Lot and the 318 shepherd/warriors\\nborn in his house indicate that Abraham did not separate from his father's\\nhousehold but rather influenced his father's household to worship the God\\nwho led him to Canaan.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nGenesis 14 provides a remarkable fit of Scripture and secular history with\\nregard to Abraham's early years. It records that the Sodom-Gomorrah\\nconfederation had paid tribute to the king of Elam for 12 years. When they\\ndid not pay in the 13<sup>th</sup>, the war machine from Mesopotamia came\\nto teach them a lesson in the 14<sup>th</sup> year led by Elam. The\\ncampaign apparently lasted the better part of two years. Secular history\\nrecords that Ur reached its zenith during the 97 golden-year rule of the\\nfive kings of the Third Dynasty. It is an historical fact that its end came\\nsuddenly at the hands of Elam. Elam broke Ur's control of the lower\\nEuphrates in a military invasion that overwhelmed the capital itself,\\nburned its palace and enslaved its population. In a strange and as yet not\\nunderstood alliance with other Mesopotamian powers only specifically\\nreported in Scripture to date, Elam extended its control all the way to\\nSodom and Gomorrah. Had Abraham not left Ur in obedience to God, he would\\nhave lost his freedom and wealth if not his life.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe timeline looks like this: Scripture clearly indicates the passing of 14\\nyears, from the first year in which the pentapolis paid tribute to Elam\\nuntil Elam and its allies arrived to punish them for not paying in the 13    <sup>th</sup>. The time needed to forge alliances and establish control\\nfrom Ur up the Euphrates and then down the Jordan Valley to the five cities\\nis unknown. This could have been accomplished in as little as a year or\\ntwo. Thus, an estimated minimum of 16 years passed from the fall of Ur to\\nthe punishment dealt the five cities.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSometime before the fall of Ur, God called Abraham. Upon responding to the\\ncall, he lived an unknown number of years in Haran. Then God led him from\\nHaran to Canaan and when Elam arrived to punish the rebels Abraham had been\\nin Canaan approximately nine years. This is known because of the next\\nsequence of events in Abraham's life: God's appearance in a vision and the\\nblood covenant the next spring, the birth of Ishmael a year later and the\\nbirth of Isaac when Abraham was 100 and Ishmael was 14. Since Abraham was\\n75 when he arrived in Canaan, he would be 84 when the invaders defeated\\nSodom and enslaved Lot.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSecular history gives various ranges of dates for the glorious years of the\\nThird Dynasty of Ur. The ancient cuneiform documents are consistent in\\ntheir records of the names of the five kings of the Third Dynasty, the\\nnumber of years each reigned and the major achievements of each. It was the\\nsecond of five that actually raised Ur to dominance. However, secular\\nhistory has been unable to anchor their 97-year total reign to a fixed\\ntime. Instead, it offers various ranges of dates, from early, to moderate,\\nto late, etc. They differ by as much as at total of 155 years. The earliest\\nrange ends at 2150 BC and the latest ends at 1995 BC. Abraham was 75 at\\n2091 so he fits well into the secular range of dates.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nTwo entire chapters of the Bible come out of Elam's rise (Genesis 14 and\\n15). Is that enough to set us thinking that maybe Abraham was an important\\nfigure in Ur? Could it be that at the time of God's call, Abraham was well\\ninto the politics or military of Ur and did not like the way negotiations\\nwere going between his country and Elam? Could it be that due to the\\ngrowing problems facing Ur's leaders, he was not so certain about Ur's\\nfuture after all? Could it be that when God called, for the first time in\\nhis life he might actually consider leaving Ur? We can only wonder but we\\ndo know that God's timing is perfect.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nHere is another thought to chew on: Elam's having conquered the Jordan\\nValley just years before Abraham arrived in Canaan would explain why he\\ncould move about so freely. The long established powers of the land had\\nbeen shaken to their roots and were busy recovering and rebuilding after\\nElam swept through so they paid little attention to this man and his many\\nflocks and shepherds. This also vouches for our dates.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nFinally, in an entirely different vein, Elam only dominated Southern\\nMesopotamia for a short time. Then in some as yet unexplained way the\\nalliance or one of its members turned on Elam and its power was broken in\\nthat region until the rise of the Persian Empire 1500 years later. A\\n215-year sojourn in Egypt would place the birth of Abraham long after\\nElam's dominance in Mesopotamia and Sodom. If that were the case, Genesis\\n14 would be fiction. Further, rivals of Ur governed that city-state once\\nElam's control had been broken. So whether it was Elam or Ur's rivals, such\\na time would not have been conducive to Terah and his relatives thriving in\\nUr. If his kinsmen survived at all, it would have been because they fled\\nthe country. If they returned, they would have been involved in picking up\\nthe pieces and living under the control of various other powers and that is\\nnot how secular sources picture the Ur of Abraham's day.\\n</p>\\n<p align=\\\"center\\\">\\n<strong>Scriptural Support that Abraham's Call Came in Ur</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWe are convinced that God's call came to Abraham in Ur, not Haran, and that\\nhe spent a number of years in Haran before God led him the rest of the way\\nto Canaan. But hyper literalists who bend all Scripture to the numbers in\\nShem's genealogy reject this position. To support their 215-year Egyptian\\nsojourn view, they interpret the Apostle Paul's words in Galatians 3 to\\nmean that God called Abraham in Haran, not Ur and that he immediately\\nfollowed God to Canaan. Then 430-years later God gave Israel the Law on\\nMount Sinai immediately following the Exodus. They interpret the details of\\nAbraham's life to fit this view. Book after book repeats this idea. The\\nApostle is their only hope even though they misinterpret his argument. When\\nthey deal with the four witnesses of chapter 2, they always start with\\nPaul.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nNevertheless, what saith the LORD? In the first half of this chapter we\\nshowed that such a view is ruled out by the events in Abraham's life. The\\nrest of the chapter will look at specific statements of Scripture. The\\ninformation will be organized around eight Old Testament passages, one New\\nTestament passage and an argument from silence. These ten arguments show\\nbeyond question the error of a Haran call and the 215-year sojourn behind\\nit.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Stephen Says \\\"Ur\\\"</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIn the days following the resurrection of Christ, Stephen was full of grace\\nand power, doing great wonders and signs among the people. Those who\\ndisputed with him could not withstand the wisdom and the    <strong><u>Spirit</u></strong> with which he spoke, so they found people\\nwho falsely charged that Stephen spoke blasphemous words against Moses and\\nGod (Acts 6:8-11). This caused a disturbance that landed Stephen before the\\ncouncil where additional false charges were made. Stephen defended himself\\nby reciting major events in the history of Israel, especially showing how\\nthe nation had established a pattern of rejecting God's messengers, last of\\nall, the Messiah. Speaking by the Holy Spirit, he began with Jewish history\\nthat none could deny:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    <sup>2</sup>\\n    Brothers and fathers, hear me. The God of glory appeared to our father\\nAbraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran,        <sup>3</sup>and said to him, \\\"Go out from your land and from your\\n    kindred and go into the land which I will show you.\\\" <sup>4</sup>Then\\n    he went out from the land of the Chaldeans and lived in Haran. And\\n    after his father died, God removed him from there into this land. Acts\\n    7:2-4.\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nStephen said exactly what this book maintains are the facts and which those\\nwho add only numbers deny. His words are clear. They can't be interpreted\\nto mean something else. So, in this case the numerologists don't deny or\\nput a spin on what he said. Rather they say he made a slip of the tongue;\\nwhat he said was erroneous. They say that inerrancy only guarantees that\\nStephen said these words, not that he had his facts straight. They say\\nmaybe he was under pressure and was rattled or maybe he was a young\\nbeliever and didn't have a good grasp of the Old Testament. Somehow,\\nStephen misstated. Their numbers supplant words.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIt is true that inerrancy assures us of what someone said, even when they\\nspeak error. For instance, God had told Adam he would die if he ate fruit\\nfrom a certain tree. Then the serpent said to Eve that she would not die if\\nshe ate from that tree (Genesis 3:4). Scripture accurately reported that\\nthe serpent said this even though what he said was untrue.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThis interpretative tool is useful, but used wrongly is dangerous. It can\\nbe used against any of the people in Scripture that said something the\\ncritic disagrees with. There must be strong evidence that the speaker spoke\\nin error. Where is this evidence? Their only evidence is that it conflicts\\nwith their interpretation of what Paul said in Galatians three. So they say\\nPaul was right; Stephen was wrong. We suggest both Stephen and Paul were\\nright. When Paul's words are correctly understood, his words will agree\\ncompletely with the words of Stephen. Invoking this extra ordinary use of\\nthe principle of inerrancy is incredulous, strained. After all, Stephen was\\nfull of the Holy Spirit:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    <sup>5</sup>\\n    Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit. <sup>8</sup>\\n    Stephen, full of grace and power, was doing great wonders and signs\\n    among the people. <sup>10</sup>They could not withstand the wisdom and\\n    the Spirit with which he was speaking. Acts 6:5, 8, 10.\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nRecognizing that Stephen did speak accurately, others find a different\\ninterpretation of Acts 7:4 in order to maintain Abraham was the firstborn\\nof Terah's sons. They observe that three personalities are found in verses\\n2-4: God, Terah and Abraham. While verse four speaks of \\\"his father,\\\" it\\nuses the personal pronoun four times. They say \\\"he removed him\\\" refers to\\nAbraham removing his father Terah, not God removing Abraham. So rather than\\nGod leading Abraham on to Canaan after Terah died, this view says that\\nsixty years after Abraham arrived in Canaan, his father died. Abraham then\\nreturned to Haran and brought his father's body to Canaan for burial. They\\nemphasize that this is consistent with the Hebrew mindset of the importance\\nof where one was buried and are adamant about this interpretation.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSuch an explanation is strained and unnecessary. Why would Stephen begin\\nhis address with where Abraham's father was buried rather than that God\\nHimself led the founder of the Jewish race to Canaan? This bad explanation\\ndemonstrates just how far the numbers over words folks will go to uphold\\ntheir chronology from Shem to Abraham. They seem to suffer from\\nover-literalism. This chapter previously showed another example of\\nover-literalism. When Scripture says that at the age of 70 Terah fathered\\nthree sons, Abraham, Nahor and Haran, it was not implying that they were\\ntriplets or that this was their birth order. Rather, Scripture was naming\\nthem in the order of their importance. Abraham was the youngest, not the\\noldest.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nNow for the eight Old Testament passages that indicate the call came in Ur.\\nMany times a single statement in the Bible is used to establish a biblical\\ntruth. Two or three witnesses established a truth in a Jewish court of law.\\nIncluding the silence of Scripture, we find ten to establish that Ur was\\nthe country God called Abraham to leave.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Eight Old Testament Scriptures Argue for \\\"Ur\\\"</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n1.<strong> Genesis 15:7.</strong> God Himself said He brought Abraham out\\nfrom Ur. If the call had come in Haran, God would have said \\\"I am the LORD\\nwho brought you out of Haran.\\\"<strong></strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    And he said to him, \\\"I am the LORD who brought you out from Ur of the\\n    Chaldeans to give you this land to possess.\\\" Genesis 15:7.\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n2. <strong>Genesis 12:1.</strong> In the call God told Abraham to separate\\nfrom his father's household. That would make sense if the call came in Ur\\nbecause his father had compromised with the idolatry of that city and God\\nwanted to get Abraham away from his father's influence. But if the call\\ncame in Haran after his father died, there would be no father with his\\nidolatry to separate from. Death would have done the job. Further, by the\\ntime his father died, his father's household had turned from the idolatry\\nof Ur and was worshiping at Abraham's altar in Haran. In the end Abraham\\nand Lot inherited Terah's household.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n3. <strong>Genesis 11:31. </strong>At God's prompting the journey began in\\nUr, not Haran.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    Terah took Abram [Abraham] his son and Lot the son of Haran, his\\n    grandson, and Sarai [Sarah] his daughter-in-law, his son Abram's wife,\\n    and they went forth together from Ur of the Chaldeans to go into the\\n    land of Canaan, but when they came to Haran, they settled there.\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThis verse was written in retrospect. It clearly says they departed from\\nUr, not Haran, to go to Canaan. While Terah was the patriarch and therefore\\nnominally in charge, his son Abraham was determined to obey God and go to a\\nland God would show him, so in effect, Terah was accompanying his son, not\\nleading his son.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n4. <strong>Genesis 11:28</strong> says that \\\"Haran [Terah's oldest son]\\ndied in the presence of his father Terah in the land of his kindred, in Ur\\nof the Chaldeans.\\\" Terah's kindred which we would call relatives lived in\\nUr, not Haran. Since one of the conditions of God's call to Abraham was to\\nleave his kindred, the call must have come where Abraham's kindred\\nlived-Ur.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n5. <strong>Genesis 11:27-25:11.</strong> Argument from the organization of\\nGenesis. The 215-year view notes that the death of Terah is recorded in\\nGenesis 11 while the call is recorded in Genesis 12. They conclude that the\\ncall was issued after Terah's death. When they read \\\"Now the LORD said to\\nAbram&#8230;,\\\" they understand it to be saying, \\\"<strong>Then</strong> the\\nLORD said to Abram&#8230;\\\" Genesis 12:1. But, are these events sequential?\\nDoes the fact that the record of the call follows the notice of Terah's\\ndeath prove God issued the call after Terah's death? Not at all.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nGenesis arranges biographical material in logical groupings. First one life\\nor episode is stated, then another life or episode is presented. Terah's\\nlife is presented in Genesis 11:27-32. Abraham's life follows in Genesis\\n12-25:11. This is followed by Ishmael's in Genesis 25:12-18, Isaac's in\\nGenesis 25:19-26:35, Jacob's in 27-35, Esau's in 36, then Joseph's and so\\non. What could be more important in the Abraham section than his call?\\nThus, the Abraham chapters begin with his call. The fact that Abraham's\\ncall is recorded following the end of the section on Terah says nothing\\nabout when it was issued.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n6. <strong>Nehemiah 9:7-8. </strong>Other Old Testament books refer to\\nAbraham's country as Ur, not Haran. Abraham was told to leave his country.\\nSince his country was Ur, the call came when he was living there.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    <sup>7</sup>\\n    You are the LORD, the God who chose Abram and brought him out of Ur of\\n    the Chaldeans and gave him the name Abraham. <sup>8</sup>You found his\\n    heart faithful before you and made with him the covenant to give to his\\n    offspring the land of the Canaanite&#8230;.\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nNehemiah ranks high among pious Old Testament Jews in prominent places. He\\nmourned and wept with fasting and prayers for days when he heard that the\\nwalls of Jerusalem had not been repaired. Then when he was performing his\\ntask of setting wine before the emperor of the Persian Empire, Artaxerxes,\\nthe king noticed his sadness. The story came out and Nehemiah was allowed\\nto go to Jerusalem to rebuild the walls. He organized those who had\\nreturned to Jerusalem and in the face of much opposition, the walls were\\nrebuilt in just 52 days. Following this was a time of intense spiritual\\nrenewal. He records the Levites praying the words quoted above. They\\nacknowledged that God had brought Abraham out of Ur of the Chaldeans. For\\nfifteen hundred years the descendants of Abraham had understood that God\\nfirst called Abraham in Ur and later in Canaan made a covenant with him to\\ngive his descendants that land. God's bringing was from Ur, not from Haran.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n7-8. <strong>Joshua 24:2-3. </strong>Two arguments come from these and\\nother verses:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    <sup>2</sup>\\n    Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, \\\"Long ago your fathers lived\\n    beyond the Euphrates, Terah, the father of Abraham and of Nahor, and\\n    they served other gods. <sup>3</sup>Then I took your father Abraham\\n    from beyond the River and led him through all the land of Canaan, and\\n    made his offspring many&#8230;\\\" Joshua 24:2-3.\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nJoshua specifically states that the fathers of Israel, Terah, Abraham and\\nNahor, practiced idolatry (\\\"served other gods\\\") before God took Abraham\\nfrom where they lived \\\"beyond the Euphrates\\\" to Canaan. Their idolatry was\\nreal. They did this in Ur. God broke Abraham's idolatrous ways by\\nseparating him from the powerful idolatrous culture of Ur. In Haran Abraham\\nestablished the worship of the true God in Terah's household. This worship\\ncontinued during the lifetime of Isaac and was the faith Jacob was raised\\nin. On the other hand, Nahor followed Terah and Abraham to the general area\\naround Haran but kept his idols. His grandson still held to them when Jacob\\ncame to live with him. Abraham's break with idolatry began when he moved\\nfrom Ur, not from Haran. Therefore, the call came in Ur, not Haran.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nJoshua's use of the phrase \\\"beyond the Euphrates\\\" also points to the call\\ncoming in Ur, not Haran. Altogether this phrase or similar words occur a\\ndozen times more in Ezra and Nehemiah. The Euphrates is 1000 miles long. It\\nbegins near the mountains of Armenia, flows somewhat west, curves south and\\nfinally heads southeast to empty into the Persian Gulf. Haran is across the\\nEuphrates River but the expression is mostly used for more than simply\\ncrossing the river. It is like a sweep of the hand to indicate a great\\ndistance. In most of its occurrences this phrase refers to Lower\\nMesopotamia. Thus, it also confirms that the call came in Ur.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n9. While Scripture specifically says the call came in Ur as seen in the\\nmany references above, nowhere in the Old or New Testaments does it say or\\neven hint that the call came in Haran. Arguments from silence in themselves\\ndo not establish a truth of Scripture. But when combined with positive\\ndeclarative statements, they do add validity to the concept under\\nconsideration.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIn summary, the conditions of Abraham's call, to leave country, kindred,\\nfamily and go to a land God would show him could only apply to the time\\nwhen Abraham lived in Ur. Why is that so important? Abraham had to replace\\nthe idolatry that gripped Ur with faith in the one true God. Was he ready\\nfor that? He was ready to leave his kindred and Ur, but leaving his\\nfather's household was a road block. Refusing to stay behind they also\\nwould need to leave their idol worship and that was not easily done. So\\nHaran became an important first step. It cannot be dismissed which the call\\ncoming in Haran does. Hebrews 11 makes it clear that by faith Abraham\\nobeyed, going out to an unknown destination but ultimately expecting a city\\nwith better foundations, one whose builder and maker is God. Exactly what\\nhe left is very important: the world with all its idols, wealth and glamor.\\nThat was Ur, not Haran.\\n</p>\\n<p align=\\\"center\\\">\\n<strong>\\n    Brief Chronology of Abraham --- Focusing on Elam's Defeat of Ur\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nOverview: Based on 1876 BC arrival in Egypt (Dates BC):\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n2006 - Birth of Jacob\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n2066 - Birth of Isaac\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n2166 - Birth of Abraham\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nFirm (f) and estimated (e) dates for events in Abraham's early years:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n2166f - Birth of Abraham in the country of Ur, Mesopotamia\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n2156f - Birth of Sarah\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n2131e - Abraham marries Sarah when she turns 25; he is 35\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n2111e - 2106e - No children after 20-25 years of marriage; Sarah is\\nobviously barren\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n2111e - 2106e - God calls Abraham to leave his country;\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAbraham accompanied by his father's household follows God's leading\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAbraham and Sarah with their father's household settle in Haran\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong> 2100e - Approximate year that Elam crushes Ur</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n2097e - Elam puts the Jordan Valley pentapolis under tribute\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n2091f - Terah dies; Abraham is 75; God leads him from Haran to Canaan\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n2082e - Mesopotamian armies defeat Jordan Valley pentapolis; Abraham\\nrescues Lot\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n2081f - God's promises and prophecy to Abraham in Genesis 15\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n2080f - Birth of Ishmael\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n2066f - Birth of Isaac (when Abraham is 100 and Ishmael is 14\\n</p>\\n\\n\"},We={html:'<h1>\\nChapter Four\\n</h1>\\n<h1>\\nJacob\\'s Life Requires a 430-Year Egyptian Sojourn\\n</h1>\\n<p>\\nThe record of Jacob\\'s life is a moving account of divine intervention and\\ngrowing faith. It also supports a 430-year Egyptian sojourn. To make it\\nread otherwise those who elevate numbers over words reinterpret events in\\nhis life to make them support their 215-year, no-abbreviated-genealogies\\nview. In order to see that his life does support 430-years, a careful,\\nin-depth look at the events in his life after the pattern of chapter three\\nis necessary.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWhen Jacob\\'s father turned 40, Abraham secured a bride for him (Genesis\\n25:21). After twenty years of barrenness Isaac prayed for her and God\\ngranted his prayer. Miraculously, she became pregnant with twins. As the\\nbabies developed a strange thing began to happen. She sensed a struggling\\nin her womb. She inquired of the LORD and He said:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nTwo nations are in your womb, and two peoples from within you shall be\\ndivided; the one shall be stronger than the other, the older shall serve\\nthe younger. Genesis 25:23.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe struggle in Rebekah\\'s womb foretold the future of the twins and their\\ndescendants. There would be strife, not harmony. There would be two\\nseparate nations pursuing their own interests, not family working toward a\\ncommon goal. The older would dominate for a time but eventually the younger\\nwould prevail. Rebekah did not learn this from a soothsayer or even second\\nhand from a prophet of God. No less than God Himself gave this information\\nto her directly in answer to her prayer.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAs to their actual births, of Esau Scripture records \"The first came out\\nred, all his body like a hairy cloak.\" Of Jacob, Scripture continues,\\n\"afterward his brother came out with his hand holding Esau\\'s heel\" (Genesis\\n25:26). The midwives must have been dismayed when the second of the twins\\nimmediately followed with his hand holding the heel of the first. Next,\\nScripture gives a snapshot of the direction the boys\\' lives took:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    When the boys grew up, Esau was a skillful hunter, a man of the field,\\n    while Jacob was a quiet man, dwelling in tents. Genesis 25:27.\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIn the above verse Scripture immediately advances from their birth to the\\ntwo as grown men, reporting that the twins grew up to be very different.\\nHunting characterized the one, the quiet of home the other. Of Jacob Unger\\nwrites \"Jacob preferred the quiet of a home life to the active dangerous\\ncareer of a hunter.\"<a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\" title=\"\">[1]</a> So\\nScripture is extremely brief about their early years. Just the struggling\\nin the womb, God\\'s personal explanation and what characterized their adult\\nyears. How different is the story of their father Isaac and all Scripture\\ntold of his conception, birth, youth and adult years before marrying at the\\nage of 40.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nScripture does not elaborate on what it meant to be a skillful hunter or a\\nquiet man living in tents. It only hints at these two pursuits by saying\\n\"Isaac loved Esau because he ate of his game, but Rebekah loved Jacob\"\\n(Genesis 25:28). Esau wasn\\'t just the average hunter; he was \"skillful.\" He\\ngreatly enhanced the family table with his game. Because of this he was\\nnumber one in his father\\'s books. Rebekah\\'s greater concern was the\\nfamily\\'s livelihood. Because Jacob focused on learning and operating the\\nfamily ranching business, he became number one in her books. While Esau\\nloved to feel the adrenaline of the hunt, Jacob accepted the discipline of\\nrepetitive daily chores. That daily routine tied him down to a predictable\\nschedule. These two men couldn\\'t have been more different.\\n</p>\\n<h3>\\nPurchasing the Birthright\\n</h3>\\n<p>\\nAfter explaining the direction of each twin\\'s life, Scripture discloses\\njust one event in their adult lives before Esau married at the age of 40.\\nOne day Esau returned home from the hunt. Apparently he had pressed and\\npressed without success to the point of exhaustion. He asked Jacob for a\\nbowl of his stew. This indicates that the quiet man was there at his\\ntypical station, doing something useful to sustain the family, this time\\ncooking. Here is what happened:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong><sup>31</sup></strong>\\n<strong>\\n    Jacob said, \"Sell me your birthright now.\" <sup>32</sup>Esau said, \"I\\n    am about to die; of what use is a birthright to me?\" <sup>33</sup>Jacob\\n    said, \"Swear to me now.\" So he swore to him and sold his birthright to\\n    Jacob. <sup>34b</sup>Thus Esau despised his birthright. Genesis\\n    25:31-33, 34b.\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBirthright? Where did this come from? How could Jacob suggest such a thing?\\nWhile Scripture gives commentaries on Esau\\'s action, it does not explore\\nthe background of this event. It assumes the reader would know all that was\\ninvolved, that grandfather Abraham died when the twins were 15 years old\\nand would have told them again and again about God\\'s appearances to him and\\nthe promises those appearances conveyed. Isaac also had similar personal\\nexperiences with God and had witnessed God\\'s visitations to his father\\nAbraham as well. These stories were also told over and over in family\\ngatherings. While Rebekah may have kept secret God\\'s words to her before\\nthe birth of the twins, they must have been aware of at least some of the\\ndetails of their births and why they were given such unusual names.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThus, while Scripture does not elaborate, it only seems reasonable that\\nover the years Jacob and Esau wondered about those stories. Though God\\'s\\nvisitations to his father and grandfather seemed remote, so beyond anything\\nactually happening in their lives, if there was something to them, Jacob\\nwanted to be their recipient. Eventually Jacob came to place a measure of\\nfaith in them and decided to watch for an opportunity to gain the\\nbirthright. Then suddenly the opportunity came. Esau was famished and\\nwanted something Jacob had. Jacob made the offer and maybe to his amazement\\nthe possessor of the birthright agreed saying \"I am about to die; of what\\nuse is a birthright to me?\" (Genesis 25:31).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nJust what was the birthright at this time? It is worth hearing from a\\nleading Hebrew commentator:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    The birthright consisted afterward in a double portion of the father\\'s\\n    inheritance (Deuteronomy 21:17); but with the Patriarchs it embraced\\n    the chieftainship, rule over the brethren and the entire family\\n    (Genesis 27:29) and the title to the blessing of promise (Genesis 27:4,\\n    27-29), which included the future possession of Canaan and of covenant\\n    fellowship with Jehovah (Genesis 28:4).\\n</strong>\\n<a href=\"#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\" title=\"\">[2]</a>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nPossessing this birthright conveying all God promised to Abraham and Isaac;\\nit was the deed to these promises, but it required faith in the true God.\\nScripture pronounces harsh judgment on Esau\\'s act. This passage says he\\ndespised his birthright. Hebrews calls him unholy because of selling his\\nbirthright for a mere meal (Hebrews 12:16). Malachi 1:3 gives an overall\\ndivine assessment: \"I have loved Jacob, but Esau, I have hated\" (Malachi\\n1:3). Henry Morris concurs in these assessments:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    It is remarkable that so many Christians are quick to defend Esau and\\n    rebuke Jacob [trading a meal for the birthright], when God has done\\n    neither. Esau was a profane fornicator, with no redeeming qualities\\n    whatsoever, caring nothing about the spiritual significance and\\n    responsibilities of the patriarchal birthright, until he thought that\\n    its loss might diminish his inherited wealth.\\n</strong>\\n<a href=\"#_ftn3\" name=\"_ftnref3\" title=\"\">[3]</a>\\n<strong> (Our words in brackets.)</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAfter the birthright incident nothing more is said of the boys until the\\nend of the next chapter of Genesis. There Scripture reports Esau got\\nmarried. By way of background, when Isaac turned forty, Abraham found him a\\nbride-Rebekah, a granddaughter of Abraham\\'s older brother Nahor. Now Esau\\nwas 40, yet his father gave no indication of finding him and Jacob mates.\\nPossibly Esau became convinced his father would do nothing so according to\\nthe following verse, before the year was out, the man of action, Esau,\\nmarried not one but two Canaanite women:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong><sup>34</sup></strong>\\n<strong>\\n    When Esau was forty years old, he took Judith the daughter of Beeri the\\n    Hittite, and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite, <sup>35</sup>\\n    and they made life bitter for Isaac and Rebekah. Genesis 26:34-35.\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThis action brought Canaanite life with all its evil right into Isaac\\'s\\nhousehold. The two Canaanite women made life bitter for both Rebekah and\\nIsaac. Jacob, seeing their distress, decided to wait for the right woman.\\nThat wait lasted forty more years. This second report of Esau\\'s actions\\nconclude how Scripture would have us view Esau at this point in his life,\\nconfirming the characterizations of Genesis 25:34, Hebrews 12:16 and\\nMalachi 1:3.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe next glimpse of the twins is even more distressing and not without\\ncontroversy. When Isaac thought he was dying, he determined to pass on the\\nblessing of the firstborn to Esau, the twin born first. In view of the\\nwords of God to Rebekah and the direction of Esau\\'s life, Isaac\\'s plan is\\nunexplainable. Without question he was badly confused. But we know what\\nhappened. Rebekah learned of the plan. She dressed Jacob to impersonate\\nEsau and Isaac unintentionally gave the blessing to Jacob.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nEsau was angry and let it be known that he would kill his brother once his\\nfather died. At that point he would add murder to his list of evils. Jacob\\ndidn\\'t doubt his older brother\\'s word and feared for his life. But sanity\\nprevailed. Rebekah discussed the situation with Isaac who blessed Jacob and\\nsent him away to the household of his mother\\'s father in Haran. He must\\ntake a wife from his mother\\'s people. He must not marry a Canaanite woman.\\nTrusting God he departed on the 500-mile journey with only a staff in his\\nhand. In this way God preserved the Abrahamic line from the abominations of\\nthe Canaanites.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nOnly a few nights from home 74-year-old Jacob had a dream. In it he saw the\\nangels of God rushing up and down on a grand staircase as they carried out\\nGod\\'s work on earth. At the top was God Himself. He spoke to Jacob, saying\\nHe was the God of Abraham and Isaac, that He would give this land to Jacob\\nand his offspring, that his offspring would be like the dust of the earth,\\nthat in Jacob and his offspring all the families of the earth would be\\nblessed, that He would keep Jacob and return him to this land (Genesis\\n28:10-15).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nNothing more is said of the journey but no sooner had Jacob reached his\\ndestination than he was taken with Rachel who was \"beautiful in form and\\nappearance\" (Genesis 29:17). Rachel was the daughter of his mother\\'s\\nbrother. Since her older sister, Leah, was becoming something of an old\\nmaid, Rachel might have been considerably older than a teenager. Jacob\\noffered to serve seven years for her hand in marriage and Laban agreed to\\nthe offer.\\n</p>\\n<h2>\\nA Closer Look at Jacob\\n</h2>\\n<p>\\nJacob has received much criticism for the actions of his youth. But are\\nthey consistent with God\\'s revelation? What do we learn from Scripture?\\nFirst, Jacob\\'s character. Dr. Morris was distressed to find most\\ncommentators characterized Jacob as a crooked man, a heel grabber. While it\\ncannot be denied he was shrewd, even crafty, he had fine qualities that\\nneed to be laid beside his stealth. Per chance they mitigate and even cast\\na different light on the broad judgment that he was basically dishonest.\\nAfter all, Rahab told a direct lie but no commentator casts her in the\\nlight of being a liar. David committed adultery but no commentator\\ncharacterizes him as basically immoral. Other qualities far outshine\\nRahab\\'s lie and David\\'s adultery. As for Jacob, he was professional,\\nproductive, hard-working, likable and God was with him.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWas he basically dishonest? It was his mother who all but ordered him to\\nimpersonate Esau. She had great influence on him. He had even foregone\\nmarriage out of his respect for his parents\\' feelings and judgment. His\\nfather was apparently about to disregard God\\'s will and his mother proposed\\na way to avoid that. As to her plan, it certainly was dishonest, but the\\ntendency toward dishonesty came mostly from her side of the family. Her\\nbrother was as crooked as they come. He changed Jacob\\'s wages countless\\ntimes to steal what rightly belonged to Jacob. He gave Jacob Leah after\\nJacob had served him seven years for Rachel. So let\\'s dispense with\\nlabeling Jacob \"dishonest.\" Instead see him as Scripture begins to speak\\nmuch of him, beginning with his arrival in the region of Haran.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    Now as soon as Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother\\'s\\n    brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother\\'s brother, Jacob came near\\n    and rolled the stone from the well\\'s mouth and watered the flock of\\n    Laban his mother\\'s brother. Genesis 29:10.\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nNotice Jacob\\'s skill with animals. Although he was a complete stranger to\\nthis flock, Rachel\\'s sheep immediately sensed they were in good hands,\\nallowing him to water them. Jacob also understood the sheep business for he\\nhad previously noted to the other shepherds that it was high noon and the\\nsheep needed to be grazing, not waiting to be watered. Then, without help,\\nhe removed the cover from the well and watered Rachel\\'s sheep. He was not\\nbound by incompetent practices which limited the success of shepherding in\\nthat area. This act displayed initiative, independence, strength,\\nconfidence and competence.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIf Jacob acted with professionalism towards this newly encountered flock,\\nhis next action showed a soul filled with deep emotion and expectation. His\\nskill with the sheep was only exceeded by his way with the shepherdess.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong><sup>11</sup></strong>\\n<strong>\\n    Then Jacob kissed Rachel and wept aloud. <sup>12</sup>And Jacob told\\n    Rachel that he was her father\\'s kinsman, and he was Rebekah\\'s son, and\\n    she ran and told her father. Genesis 29:11-12.\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe kiss: Maybe tender and on the cheek, but arising from deep emotion.\\nThis 74-year-old man bawled aloud. Just as Abraham\\'s servant had found his\\nmother immediately upon his arrival 94 years before, Jacob no more arrived\\nthan he stumbled on what he must have hoped would be his life\\'s partner.\\nBoth events happened somewhere near Haran. She was the right fit-his\\nmother\\'s niece, his own cousin whom he had never met and probably did not\\nknow existed, beautiful, enterprising, engaging and receiving. What a\\nreward after forsaking his home of 74 years and making a perilous, lonely,\\n500-mile journey. The girl\\'s father invited Jacob to stay with them.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe next verses tell us Jacob was smart and industrious. Rather than\\nspending all of his time with Rachel, he immediately set out to impress her\\nfather with his work ethic and he succeeded. A month later Laban\\nuncharacteristically began the following conversation:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    Because you are my kinsman, should you therefore serve me for nothing?\\n    Tell me, what shall your wages be? Genesis 29:15.\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWages? Here was Jacob\\'s opportunity. Jacob wanted Rachel. He had no money\\nfor a dowry but he could work. He made an offer of service for this\\ndaughter of Laban. He would serve Laban seven years for Rachel and then she\\nwould be his. Next we read:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong><sup>20</sup></strong>\\n<strong>\\n    So Jacob served seven years for Rachel, and they seemed to him but a\\n    few days because of the love he had for her. <sup>21</sup>Then Jacob\\n    said to Laban, \"Give me my wife that I may go in to her, for my time is\\n    completed.\" Genesis 29:20-21.\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWhat love it had been that seven years would seem like a few days. Then\\nJacob went to Laban and asked for Rachel so he could \"go in to her.\" The\\nreason he was asking was that he had completed his seven years of service\\nfor her. \"Going in to her\" is a euphemism for marital intimacy. In effect\\nJacob was saying that he had not violated Rachel\\'s virginity even though he\\nhad been with Laban seven years.\\n</p>\\n<h2>\\nJacob Marries the Wrong Woman\\n</h2>\\n<p>\\nNext Scripture reports on the wedding celebration:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong><sup>22</sup></strong>\\n<strong>\\n    So Laban gathered together all the people of the place and made a\\n    feast. <sup>23</sup>But in the evening he took his daughter Leah and\\n    brought her to Jacob, and he went in to her. <sup>25</sup>And in the\\n    morning behold, it was Leah! And Jacob said to Laban, What is this you\\n    have done to me? Did I not serve with you for Rachel? Why then have you\\n    deceived me?\" <sup>26</sup>Laban said, \"It is not so done in our\\n    country, to give the younger before the firstborn.\" Genesis 29:22-23,\\n    25-26.\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe passage does not say how Laban switched daughters but it clearly states\\nhe successfully did. In the morning Jacob was outraged and accused Laban of\\ndeception. He said, \"What is this you have done to me? Did I not serve with\\nyou for Rachel?\" Why then have you deceived me? (Genesis 29:25). Clearly\\nJacob had fulfilled his end of the bargain. He had served seven years for\\nRachel. Laban affirmed it by explaining a previously unmentioned custom,\\nthat the oldest daughter had to be married first.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    The Traditional Approach: Marriage before the Years of Service\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAstonishingly, the leading advocate of the 215-year approach, Archbishop\\nJames Ussher as well as others to this day say this wedding celebration\\ntook place before Jacob had served any of the 14 years. In complete\\ndisregard to the words of the Bible Ussher offers the following chronology:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>1759 BC - Jacob flees from Esau to Haran</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>1758 BC - Leah bears Reuben</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>1757 BC - Leah bears Simeon</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>1756 BC - Leah bears Levi</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>1755 BC - Leah bears Judah</strong>\\n<a href=\"#_ftn4\" name=\"_ftnref4\" title=\"\">[4]</a>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nUssher\\'s chronology above shows Jacob to have fathered his firstborn the\\nyear following his arrival in Haran. Since Leah was the mother, by\\nimplication both daughters became wives of Jacob at the beginning of his\\n20-year stay with Laban. Ussher\\'s dates show he believed Leah\\'s first four\\nsons were born just one year apart beginning one year after Jacob\\'s arrival\\nin Haran. Why would he and those holding the 215-year view to this day\\ncontradict the clear words of Scripture? The following three reasons are\\noffered; this chapter shows that each was unsound.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n1. Scripture relates a sequence of births one after another, not several at\\nthe same time.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n2. All the children were born by the time Jacob had been with Laban 14\\nyears because of the six year work contract\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n3. The children had to be several years older than they would be if he\\nworked seven years before receiving his bride(s) because of later events in\\nthe life of Jacob.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Confirming Marriage to Leah; Serving for Rachel </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBack to our story. Laban had a solution:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong><sup>27</sup></strong>\\n<strong>\\n    [Laban said] \"Complete the week of this one [Leah], and we will give\\n    you the other [Rachel] also in return for serving me another seven\\n    years.\" <sup>28</sup>Jacob did so, and completed her [Leah\\'s] week [of\\n    wedding celebration]. Then Laban gave him his daughter Rachel to be his\\n    wife. Genesis 29:27-28. (Our words in brackets.)\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nLaban\\'s solution was that Jacob could have Rachel as well as Leah for seven\\nmore years of service. He only asked that Jacob fulfill the week of wedding\\ncelebration with Leah and then he would give Jacob Rachel as well. The\\nsolution seemed straight forward. Jacob was to complete the very public\\nmarriage celebration to the older sister. There would be no doubt in\\nanyone\\'s mind that he was married to her. After the festivities he would be\\ngiven the younger sister as well and then serve Laban seven more years for\\nthe second wife.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThis new offer meant Jacob would continue to celebrate his marriage to Leah\\nfor the remaining six days-no public scene denouncing Laban as a deceiver,\\nno cold shoulder to Leah; rather, pleasant, cheerful, celebrating. Jacob\\nhad not planned to be a bigamist. Both his father and grandfather were\\none-woman type of men. For seven years thoughts about Rachel had helped him\\nthrough each exhausting day. Her presence lit up his life. He had no\\ninterest in any other woman.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nJacob was over a barrel. He wanted Rachel with all his heart. He would do\\nalmost anything for her. Further he was a decent man and didn\\'t want to\\ndenounce Leah. Wittingly or not, he had spent the night with her. Who would\\nwant her now? He was undoubtedly angry and probably confused and he didn\\'t\\nhave the luxury of time to think it over. Scripture records his decision\\nand Laban\\'s response: \"Jacob did so and completed her week. Then Laban gave\\nhim his daughter Rachel to be his wife\" (Genesis 29:28). So Jacob said\\n\"uncle\" and soon had twice as many wives as he ever intended. Nine months\\nlater Leah gave Jacob his first son, sealing her status as his wife.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nLaban\\'s plan was a complete success. His older daughter who had attracted\\nno successful suitor was very publicly wedded to Jacob. Laban\\'s honor was\\nintact. He would have no old maid daughter languishing in his house. Most\\nlikely at least his household knew what he had done but woe to the person\\nwho questioned his actions. Thus was the power of the family patriarch in\\nhis day.\\n</p>\\n<h3>\\nProblem of the Sequence of Children\\'s Births\\n</h3>\\n<p>\\nThe genealogists say the Scripture tells the sequence of the children\\'s\\nbirths. This sequence requires approximately fourteen years. The only way\\nto find that much time is for Laban to have given his two daughters to\\nJacob at the beginning of Jacob\\'s 20-year stay. We suggest that on\\noccasion, Scripture groups similar events and thoughts before going back\\nover the same time frame to report other events and thoughts. The following\\nare examples of Scriptural grouping:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nEsau\\'s genealogy is inserted between the death of Isaac and Joseph\\'s story.\\nGenesis 35 ends with the death of Isaac. Genesis 36 chronicles 500 years of\\nJacob\\'s twin brother\\'s line. Genesis 37:1 actually backtracks to events\\nbefore Isaac\\'s death. Thus 500 years of Edomite history are inserted in the\\nmiddle of the Jacob/Joseph narrative.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nGenesis 2:5 returns to day six of creation week after Genesis 1:1-2:3\\nreports the full seven days. The sons of Japheth are listed in Genesis\\n10:2-5, then the descendants of Ham (10:6-20) and finally the descendants\\nof Shem (10:21-31). No one would dispute that division of history, but\\nGenesis 10 would be very confusing if it reported each birth as it\\nhappened. Genesis 11:27-32 reports the record of Terah before taking up\\nGod\\'s dealing with Abraham which reaches back to his call in Ur (Genesis\\n12-24) 10 or 15 years before. Genesis 35:28-29 reports the death of Isaac\\neven though it happened 13 years after the selling of Joseph in Genesis 37.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSimilarly, we believe that because several mothers were expecting at the\\nsame time and therefore births overlapped, the writer chose to group the\\nbirths of Jacob\\'s children: Leah\\'s first four, then Bilhah\\'s two, then\\nZilpah\\'s two, then Leah\\'s final three and lastly Rachel\\'s son. Because of\\noverlapping pregnancies, twelve children were born in just 10 years.\\n</p>\\n<h3>\\nTwelve Births in Ten Years\\n</h3>\\n<p>\\nOver the next ten years Jacob fathered eleven sons plus a daughter. But the\\nother side can only see seven years available for these 12 children if\\nJacob served seven years before he received two wives and then six years\\nfor the cattle. Thus they manipulate Scripture to make more time. We will\\nsee that ten years were available and that ten years was sufficient. But\\nfirst, we must acknowledge that this was the work of God. The odds of\\nhaving eleven sons in a row are enormous. God was behind all this and the\\ngoal was our salvation, Jesus Christ, Jacob\\'s ultimate seed and the defeat\\nof Satan. Scripture does not tell us all the details of the scenario God\\nused. Because some insist it was impossible, we suggest one scenario that\\nis entirely consistent with Scripture. While the following is speculative,\\nit honors Scripture.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWhen the week of celebrating Jacob\\'s marriage to Leah was over, Laban\\nquietly gave Jacob his younger daughter as well. Jacob immediately\\ntransferred to Rachel\\'s bedroom and spent nearly all of his time there for\\nthe next 13 years. At first possibly this was a family secret but in time\\nit simply became accepted as the way things were. This transfer of bedrooms\\nis apparent from the names Leah chose for her six boys and the mandrake\\nevent. She called her firstborn Reuben \"Because,\" she said, \"the LORD has\\nlooked upon my affliction; for now my husband will love me.\" (Genesis\\n29:32). How was she afflicted? How was she unloved? Her husband paid her no\\nattention. He spent his nights in Rachel\\'s tent. Score: Leah-1; Rachel-0.\\nElapsed time: 9 months since the marriage.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nJacob knew about conception. Animal breeding was his life. To say he was a\\nsuccessful animal breeder would be an understatement. He became wealthy\\nthrough his breeding skills. In the next few years Jacob discovered that\\nLeah was a virtual baby machine, and sons at that! Leah would deliver a son\\nand six months later she would conceive again-spacing boys about 15 months\\napart. Rachel had not conceived in nine months while Leah conceived that\\nvery first week. So about 6 months after Leah\\'s first delivery, Jacob began\\nvisiting her bedroom until she became pregnant again. But then he went back\\nto Rachel. Scripture tells us as much. Leah named her second son Simeon\\n\"Because the LORD has heard that I am hated.\" (Genesis 29:33). Hated? Yes.\\nHer husband spent his nights with Rachel, not with Leah. Score: Leah-2;\\nRachel-0. Elapsed time: 24 months since the marriage (9+6+9=24).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAbout 6 months after Leah\\'s second delivery, Jacob returned and soon she\\nwas expecting a third time. A total of 30 months had elapsed (9+6+9+6=30).\\nThis may have been when a new development unfolded. Rachel engaged Jacob in\\na heated argument. She demanded he make her pregnant. He said he was not\\nGod. Well, if he couldn\\'t make her pregnant, he must give her a child by\\nher handmaid, Bilhah. Jacob must have thought, \"Is a third wife the price\\nof peace?\" With that, Bilhah conceived and behold, another boy. This son\\nwas born shortly after Leah\\'s third. Score: Leah-3; Rachel-1. Elapsed time\\nsince Jacob\\'s marriage: 42 months (30+9+3=42).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSix months after her third delivery, Leah became pregnant a fourth time.\\nAbout three months later, Bilhah became pregnant with her second. So\\nfifty-four months after her marriage, Leah mothered a fourth son\\n(9+15+15+15=54) while Bilhah delivered her second son three months later.\\nFor the first time Leah did not complain about her husband\\'s absence.\\nInstead she said, \"This time I will praise the Lord.\" (Genesis 29:35).\\nScore: Leah-4; Rachel-2; Elapsed time since Jacob\\'s marriage: 57 months\\n(54+3=57). Jacob now has six sons in just four and three-quarter years.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWhen Leah didn\\'t get pregnant as she usually did about six months after the\\nbirth of her fourth son, she became uneasy. Maybe Bilhah became pregnant\\nfor a third time which would later prove to be a girl, but Leah would not\\nknow it at the time. Leah must have fretted, \"Rachel is catching up! I must\\ndo something. Rachel enlisted her handmaid. I\\'ll do the same with my\\nhandmaid Zilpah.\" As to Laban\\'s thoughts on the matter, he was already\\nbragging to his men friends: \"You hear? Six grandsons in less than five\\nyears. Isn\\'t that a record?\"\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAt the same time Jacob may have been thinking, \"God, you said, \\'Your\\noffspring shall be like the dust of the earth, and you shall spread abroad\\nto the west and to the east and to the north and to the south, and in you\\nand your offspring shall all the families of the earth be blessed.\\'\\n(Genesis 28:14). God, I had no idea, but if this is how, so be it.\" So when\\nLeah offered her handmaid, Jacob went for broke. Nine months later Zilpah\\ndelivered a son. Score: Leah-5; Rachel-2 (plus possibly a girl from\\nBilhah). Elapsed time: 72 months or six years (57+6+9=72).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSix months after the birth of Zilpah\\'s first son, Jacob came again and\\nZilpah became pregnant with a second son. When she delivered him nine\\nmonths later, Leah named him Asher which connotes happiness. This indicates\\nLeah was not displeased that her husband had fathered two sons through her\\nhandmaid. Score: Leah-6; Rachel-2. Elapsed time: 87 months or 7 years and\\nthree months (72+15=87).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nGenesis 30:14 reports that little Reuben came in from the field with\\nmandrakes (love apples-thought to help in conceiving). Rachel asked Leah\\nfor some. Apparently Jacob had given up on Rachel conceiving even though he\\nstill shared her bed. As for Leah, Jacob hadn\\'t come to her tent for nearly\\na year and a half (the last time was six months after the birth of her\\nfourth son when she did not conceive). Leah struck the following bargain:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong><sup>15</sup></strong>\\n<strong>\\n    But she [Leah] said to her, \"Is it a small matter that you have taken\\n    away my husband? Would you take away my son\\'s mandrakes also?\" Rachel\\n    said, \"Then he may lie with you tonight in exchange for your son\\'s\\n    mandrakes.\" <sup>16</sup>When Jacob came from the field in the evening,\\n    Leah went out to meet him and said, \"You must come in to me, for I have\\nhired you with my son\\'s mandrakes.\" So he lay with her that night.        <sup>17</sup>And God listened to Leah, and she conceived and bore Jacob\\n    a fifth son. Genesis 30:15-17.\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nHere we read that Leah had to hire her husband for a single night some\\nseven years and four sons after they were married! Clearly, Jacob did not\\ndivide his time between Leah and Rachel. Leah who hoped for the attention\\nof her husband came to derive happiness from her sons and from the Lord who\\nanswered her prayer for a fifth son. Maybe Jacob was still blind to her\\nworth, but who cared when the hugs of little boys never ceased, and\\ngrandfather Laban swelled with pride.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nNote that Scripture does not indicate that Leah\\'s fifth pregnancy followed\\nZilpah\\'s second pregnancy. Rather, Scripture groups Zilpah\\'s two\\npregnancies together just as it grouped Bilhah\\'s two pregnancies together.\\nWe suggest that Leah rested for two years after the birth of Judah and then\\nbecame pregnant for the fifth time when Jacob visited her tent for a single\\nnight six and a half years after their marriage. Fifteen months later Jacob\\nvisited again and Leah became pregnant with her sixth son. Fifteen months\\nlater Jacob visited again and Leah became pregnant with her first daughter.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nTo summarize, Rachel\\'s handmaid carried sons during Leah\\'s 3<sup>rd</sup>\\nand 4<sup>th</sup> pregnancies while Leah\\'s handmaid carried pregnancies\\ntowards the end of Leah\\'s 24 month resting period and again during her\\nfifth pregnancy. Rachel delivered Joseph shortly before Leah\\'s first\\ndaughter was born, maybe three months before. By this scenario, the total\\ntime involved from Jacob\\'s week-long marriage celebration to Leah to the\\nbirth of Dinah was 117 months (9+3*15+24+9+2*15=117)    <a href=\"#_ftn5\" name=\"_ftnref5\" title=\"\">[5]</a>. 117 months is nine years\\nand nine months. Final score: eight sons and one daughter for Leah\\'s team;\\nthree sons and an unreported number of daughters for Rachel\\'s team.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nRachel also learned to look to God rather than Jacob during this time:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong><sup>22</sup></strong>\\n<strong>\\nThen God remembered Rachel and God listened to her and opened her womb.        <sup>23</sup>She conceived and bore a son and said, \"God has taken away\\n    my reproach.\" <sup>24</sup>And she called his name Joseph, saying, \"May\\n    the LORD add to me another son!\" Genesis 30:22-24.\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe paragraph before the birth of Joseph concludes with \"Afterward she\\n(Leah) bore a daughter and called her name Dinah.\" (Genesis 30:21). The\\nwriter grouped Leah\\'s last three births together, but indicated that\\nJoseph\\'s birth came before Dinah\\'s birth. In this way all of the children\\nwere born within the birthing years of Leah. This is not the only scenario\\nthat could be devised, but whichever one it was, Scripture says it was\\nsuccessful. Who is man to change what God said happened?\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe scenario we use places Joseph\\'s birth at 114 months (9.5 years) after\\nJacob received his two wives. When Joseph was born is the key to the age of\\nJacob and his children. He was 130 when he appeared before Pharaoh (Genesis\\n47:9) and Joseph was 39. [Joseph was elevated at the age of 30 (Genesis\\n41:46) and officiated over seven years of plenty and two years of famine\\nwhen he stood with his father before pharaoh (30+7+2=39)]. Therefore,\\nJoseph was born when Jacob was 91 (130-39=91). We suggest that about three\\nand a half years later Jacob returned to Canaan and was 94.5 years old.\\nThus, he arrived in Haran at the age of 74 and was married at the age of 81\\n(74+7=81). Since Scripture doesn\\'t work with fractions of a year, we need\\nto work with the whole number of departing Haran at the age of 94.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIn summary, this is our view: Jacob served Laban seven years, then married\\nLeah and Rachel and fathered twelve children in the next ten years. Sadly,\\nthe numbers-over-words approach is that more years were needed and\\nconcluded Laban gave his two daughters to Jacob shortly after he first\\narrived. Thus, by silence in the case of Ussher in    <em>The Annals of the World</em>, and through explaining Scripture away in\\nthe case of his modern counterparts, inerrancy is violated. Where is faith\\nin all this? Inerrancy requires us to accept what God has clearly said, not\\nfollow our own reasoning. Unfortunately, the inerrancy view continues to be\\nrejected to this day.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nHowever, first an observation is in order. Early Bible history emphasizes\\nsons. The genealogies from Adam to Noah and from Seth to Abraham are\\nrecords of sons begetting sons. Some fathers had multiple wives. No lines\\nare recorded in terms of daughters begetting daughters; wives having\\nmultiple husbands is likewise unrecorded. When Jacob fled from Laban,\\nGenesis 31:17 reports, \"So Jacob arose and set his sons and his wives on\\ncamels.\" Yet when Jacob moved his people to Egypt, Genesis 46:5-7 says,\\n\"Then Jacob set out from Beersheba... and came into Egypt, Jacob and all\\nhis offspring with him, his sons and his sons\\' sons, his daughters, and his\\nsons\\' daughters&#8230;.\"\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n\"Daughters\" is plural, yet only Dinah is said to have been born to him in\\nall his years. Because of the emphasis on \"sons,\" it is possible that the\\nhandmaids of Leah and Rachel bore unnamed daughters to Jacob either before\\nor after he left Haran. Since the Scripture is silent about when one or\\nmore other daughters were born to Jacob, we need to be aware that possibly\\nduring the birth of the eleven sons in Haran, one or more other daughters\\nwere also born to him. We make this point because sometimes interpreters\\nstate dogmatically what Scripture does not actually say. In honoring the\\nprinciple of inerrancy, we must diligently stand where Scripture stands and\\nbe tentative where Scripture is silent. This principle will become\\nparticularly important as we look at individual genealogies later on.\\n</p>\\n<h3>\\nProblem of the Timing of Jacob\\'s Contract\\n</h3>\\n<p>\\nThe 215-year people also say Jacob\\'s wages supports their view, with the\\nfollowing line of thinking. Jacob requested being sent away as soon as his\\neleventh son, Joseph, was born. Laban urged Jacob to stay with him and\\noffered to let him name his wages. Since Jacob later said he served 14\\nyears for Laban\\'s two daughters and six years for Laban\\'s flock, the\\nstandard approach jumps to the conclusion that this request and Joseph\\'s\\nbirth occurred 14 years after Jacob joined Laban and six years before he\\ndeparted from Laban. We will show that there were multiple wage contracts\\nand clearly, this was not the one that began the final six years, thus\\ninvalidating their argument.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe relevant Scripture is found in Genesis 30-31:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong><sup>25</sup></strong>\\n<strong>\\n    As soon as Rachel had borne Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, \"Send me away,\\n    that I may go to my own home and country. <sup>26</sup>Give me my wives\\n    and my children for whom I have served you, that I may go, for you know\\n    the service that I have given you. <sup>27</sup>But Laban said to him,\\n    \"[stay with me] &#8230;. <sup>28</sup>Name your wages&#8230;\" Genesis\\n    30:25-28.\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    [Jacob said] \"These twenty years I have been in your house. I served\\n    you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your\\n    flock, and you have changed my wages ten times.\" Genesis 31:41.\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWhile their logic seems plausible, nowhere does Scripture say Joseph was\\nborn at the end of the fourteen years. Neither does it say that this labor\\ncontract began the six years for the flock. But it does quote Jacob twice\\nsaying that Laban changed his wages ten times (to his wives in 31:7 and to\\nLaban in 31:41). Eleven contracts? Once a search is made for evidence of\\nchanged wages and Jacob\\'s claim is justified, we will realize that Ussher\\nand followers commit the logical fallacies of jumping to conclusions and\\narguing from silence. So, when was the first agreement made? The last? And\\nwhat about the one that is recorded?\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWe suggest that various informal arrangements were made and then broken by\\nLaban before the most important one, the one that is recorded. Some were\\nmade even before the fourteen years were completed. This is suggested by\\nJacob\\'s later angry response to Laban:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong><sup>38</sup></strong>\\n<strong>\\n    These twenty years I have been with you. Your ewes and your female\\n    goats have not miscarried, and I have not eaten the rams of your\\n    flocks. <sup>39</sup>What was torn by wild beasts I did not bring to\\n    you. I bore the loss of it myself. From my hand you required it,\\n    whether stolen by day or stolen by night. <sup>40</sup>There I was: by\\n    day the heat consumed me, and the cold by night, and my sleep fled from\\n    my eyes. Genesis 31:38-40.\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nHow could Jacob bear the loss? How could it be required of his hand if he\\nhad no sheep or goats of his own to pay with before those final six years?\\nFemales were kept to multiply the flock while males were eaten, but Jacob,\\nin spite of having a growing household, ate none of Laban\\'s goats. Only if\\nLaban paid Jacob with animals or allowed Jacob to begin building a flock of\\nhis own during those fourteen years could he feed his family and repay\\nLaban for animals that had been torn or stolen.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAt the fourteen-year mile stone a more formal arrangement was made so he\\ncould begin to acquire camels and cows as well as flocks. While Scripture\\ndoes not record this agreement, it alludes to such an arrangement with the\\nwords about serving six years for the flocks. But when Laban saw Jacob\\ntruly prospering, he would have repeated his practice of changing Jacob\\'s\\nwages time and again.\\n</p>\\n<h3 align=\"left\">\\nWage Agreement Reported in Scripture\\n</h3>\\n<p>\\nFinally when Joseph was born, Jacob became very assertive and said to Laban\\n\"Send me away.\" This time Laban, fearing he was about to lose Jacob, let\\nJacob name his wages and Jacob stayed on. This is the wage arrangement\\nreported in Genesis 30: 25-28. It happened just after the birth of Joseph.\\nDinah was born several months later. If the final six years were a rounded\\nnumber and the actual duration were six years and three months, Jacob would\\nhave left Laban three and a half years after Dinah\\'s birth (according to\\nour proposed scenario). When Jacob did leave, he left with an enormous\\nnumber of healthy, young animals. Jacob\\'s practices did not produce this\\nbounty. It came from God who provided both his enormous herds and his sons.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWhy was Laban desperate to retain Jacob\\'s services? He himself said, \"The\\nLORD has blessed me because of you\" (30:27). Jacob states this even more\\nstrongly: \"For you had little before I came, and it has increased\\nabundantly, and the LORD has blessed you wherever I turned\" (30:30).\\nJacob\\'s service increased Laban\\'s wealth from \"little\" to \"abundant.\"\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThis recorded agreement was to begin by Jacob passing through all Laban\\'s\\nflock and removing \"every speckled, and spotted sheep and every black lamb,\\nand the spotted and speckled among the goats\" (Genesis 30:32) for himself.\\nWhat actually happened? Somehow Laban distracted Jacob or took advantage of\\nJacob\\'s work schedule and while Jacob was busy with other things, Laban\\nwith his sons rushed out and removed all such sheep and goats and sent them\\nfar away with his sons so Jacob would never get any of them back. Laban\\nviolated that contract before the ink was dry.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nOn average sheep produce lambs once a year although they can bear in both\\nthe spring and fall. Three years is about the minimum time to replace most\\nof Laban\\'s black and white animals with striped and spotted animals by\\nnormal births, but with the hand of God guiding the genetics the process\\nwas miraculously shrunk into the available time.\\n</p>\\n<h3 align=\"left\">\\nGod Overrules Laban\\'s Wage Changes\\n</h3>\\n<p>\\nJacob tells Rachel and Leah about two other changes to his wages after the\\nagreement recorded in Scripture: \"If he (Laban) said, \\'The spotted shall be\\nyour wages,\\' then all the flock bore spotted\" (31:8). In other words, when\\nLaban saw that all (or most of) of the kids were striped, mottled or\\nspotted which he originally said would be Jacob\\'s wages, he reneged,\\nlimiting Jacob\\'s wages to just those with spots. Jacob continued: \"if he\\nsaid, \\'The striped shall be your wages\\', then all the flock bore striped.\"\\nIn other words, when Laban saw all the kids were spotted, he changed the\\nwages to those kids with stripes and the next time around, all the kids\\nwere striped. Every time Laban changed Jacob\\'s wages, the flocks bred in\\nJacob\\'s favor! Jacob realized that God was doing this: \"But God did not\\npermit him to harm me\" (31:7). God was overruling Laban\\'s changes. \"Thus\"\\n(Jacob concluded) \"God has taken away the livestock of your father and\\ngiven them to me.\" (31:8-9).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nEven more evidence for the wage changing game comes in the form of a dream\\nGod gave Jacob. He told Rachel and Leah, \"The angel of God said to me in\\nthe dream, \\'Jacob,\\' and I said, \\'Here I am!\\' And he said, \\'Lift up your\\neyes and see, all the goats that mate with the flock are striped, spotted,\\nand mottled, for I have seen all that Laban is doing to you\\'\" (31:11-12).\\nWhat was God\\'s point? In the field all mating goats that were not\\ncompletely black had been removed and set aside. But in the dream, all the\\nremaining mating goats, the ones belonging to Laban, were also\\nmulticolored, thus insuring their kids would be multicolored and thus\\nbelong to Jacob. Jacob would understand the same thing to be true of the\\nflocks of sheep.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nLaban should have known that he couldn\\'t cheat God. God would simply have\\nall the kids and lambs marked with Laban\\'s most recent wage change. When\\nJacob told Rachel and Leah his dream, they agreed with Jacob that they\\nshould move to Canaan, concluding that their father was cheating them out\\nof what was rightfully theirs:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong><sup>14</sup></strong>\\n<strong>\\nIs there any portion or inheritance left to us in our father\\'s house?        <sup>15</sup>Are we not regarded by him as foreigners? For he has sold\\n    us, and he has indeed devoured our money. <sup>16</sup>All the wealth\\n    that God has taken away from our father belongs to us and to our\\n    children. Genesis 31:14-16.\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<h3>\\nTime for Jacob to Leave\\n</h3>\\n<p>\\nSheep were sheared before the hot summer but after spring lambing. It could\\nbe this master contract was negotiated before spring birthing and shearing,\\nallowing Jacob to accumulate his animals over four birthing seasons, even\\nthough only 3 &#189; years passed. Thus when he left, most of his oldest\\nanimals were just over three years old and the youngest had been born\\nwithin the previous three months.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nMaybe this is why Laban removed the multicolored animals for himself once\\nhe realized that the animals had already mated the previous fall. The\\npossibility of four birthing seasons would answer any who might maintain\\nthat Laban\\'s flocks couldn\\'t be transferred to Jacob in just three birthing\\nseasons. As previously pointed out, the six years and twenty years are\\nround numbers. The six years could be 6 &#188; years. The twenty years\\ncould be 20 &#188; years. Leah\\'s daughter could have been born 9 &#190;\\nyears after Jacob received his wives. These number would provide 3 &#189;\\nyears from this master contract until Jacob departed. In that case it could\\nhave involved four mating seasons and four birthing seasons.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAs God increased Jacob\\'s wealth, Jacob heard that the sons of Laban were\\nsaying, \"Jacob has taken all that was our father\\'s\" (Genesis 31:1).\\nFurther, Jacob saw \"that Laban did not regard him with favor as before\"\\n(Genesis 31:2). An alarming number of Laban\\'s animals had become Jacob\\'s.\\nHe was no longer their workhorse, multiplying their wealth. Jacob\\nattributed the deed to God: \"God has taken away the livestock of your\\nfather and given them to me\" (Genesis 31:9). But jealousy was replacing\\ntheir approval of Jacob. Jealousy can be deadly. Jacob was in danger. At\\nthis point God told Jacob to return to his homeland (Genesis 31:3).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBut how could he leave? For twenty years Jacob had seen Laban\\'s\\nhighhandedness. He believed Laban would never let him return to Canaan with\\nhis family and wealth. Both he and Laban said as much. Laban later said,\\n\"You have driven away my daughters like captives&#8230;\" Laban called\\nJacob\\'s children \"my sons and my daughters...\" (Genesis 31:26, 28). They\\ndidn\\'t belong to Jacob, they belonged to him and as head of the household,\\nhe intended to keep what was his. Further, he would threaten, \"It is in my\\npower to do you harm\" (Genesis 31:29). Jacob would reply, \"If the God of my\\nfather, the God of Abraham and the Fear of Isaac, had not been on my side,\\nsurely now you would have sent me away empty-handed\" (Genesis 31:42). This\\nwas the power of the patriarch. Laban could allow Jacob to go out with his\\nfamily and wealth or let him leave empty-handed. Jacob had no choice but to\\nflee secretly. Laban pursued and overtook Jacob. God intervened. Jacob was\\nable to keep his family and newly formed wealth.\\n</p>\\n<h3 align=\"left\">\\nCounting Jacob\\'s Wealth\\n</h3>\\n<p>\\nHow much had God given Jacob? How many animals did Jacob have to move?\\nGenesis 30:43 reports that Jacob \"increased greatly and had large flocks,\\nfemale servants and male servants, and camels and donkeys.\" In Genesis 32:5\\nhe sent the following word to Esau: \"I have oxen, donkeys, flocks, male\\nservants and female servants.\" He gave the following present to his brother\\nEsau:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong><sup>14</sup></strong>\\n<strong>\\n    two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and\\n    twenty rams, <sup>15</sup>thirty milking camels and their calves, forty\\n    cows and ten bulls, twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys. Genesis\\n    32:14-15.\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nJacob\\'s gift amounted to 550 animals plus calves. At Bethel twenty years\\nbefore, Jacob had promised God a tenth if God brought him back home\\n(Genesis 28:22-22). If this was that tenth, he possessed over 5000 animals\\nwhich was nearly half as many animals as Job had before Satan\\'s attack. Yet\\nmost of Jacob\\'s were acquired in just six years! Indeed, only God could\\nhave provided such increase.\\n</p>\\n<h3>\\nJacob\\'s Escape: How Do the Numbers Work Out?\\n</h3>\\n<p>\\nMultiplying Jacob\\'s livestock was one thing. Returning them to the home of\\nhis father was another. How did Jacob do it? Here is a possible scenario:\\nJacob\\'s nursing flocks could cover ten miles at most in a day without\\ninjury. It was about 500 land miles to his father in Hebron and almost 400\\nmiles to the hill country of Gilead where Jacob thought he might be safe.\\nYet it was there that Laban and his kinsmen overtook Jacob. How could Jacob\\nhave gotten so far in such a short time? Or did he have more time?\\nScripture sometimes summarizes an event that involved much more than is\\nstated as we shall shortly see.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBut first, Jacob\\'s escape and Laban\\'s pursuit:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong><sup>17</sup></strong>\\n<strong>\\n    So Jacob arose and set his sons and his wives on camels. <sup>18</sup>\\n    He drove away all his livestock, all his property that he had gained,\\n    the livestock in his possession that he had acquired in Paddan-aram, to\\n    go to the land of Canaan to his father Isaac.... <sup>21</sup>He fled\\n    with all that he had and arose and crossed the Euphrates, and set his\\n    face toward the hill country of Gilead. <sup>22</sup>When it was told\\n    Laban on the third day that Jacob had fled, <sup>23</sup>He took his\\n    kinsmen with him and pursued him [Jacob] for seven days and followed\\n    close after him into the hill country of Gilead. Genesis 31:17-18,\\n    21-23.\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThree critical details are disclosed in these verses. First, he had camels\\nfor transportation which meant speed and endurance. Second, he had to cross\\nthe Euphrates which was the major barrier between Haran and Hebron. Third,\\nhis goal was to reach the hill country of Gilead.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>The Route to Home</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe standard trade route from Haran to Egypt involved crossing the\\nEuphrates River at the last down river place it could be forded on foot-the\\nancient city of Carchemish, 65 miles due west of Haran. From the story of\\nJoseph being sold by his brothers, we learn that shepherds took their\\nflocks many miles to find pasture. Jacob would surely have located his\\nflocks in the direction of the escape route. From Carchemish the trade\\nroute went southwest for 80 miles to Aleppo and then south another 35 to\\nEbla. The trade route continued directly south for another 170 miles to\\nDamascus. Seventy-five miles beyond Damascus one reached the hill country\\nof Gilead which was directly east of the Sea of Galilee in the Jordan Rift\\nValley.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nHowever, determining specifics are difficult since at least three unknowns\\nare involved in Jacob\\'s return home. First, we only know the general area\\nof Laban\\'s ranch-Paddan-aram and Haran. Paddan-aram was a region while\\nHaran was the major supply center on the trade route. The ranch could have\\nbeen 20-30 miles from Haran. Second, we do not know for sure that Jacob\\ncrossed at the common fording of Carchemish. While that was the normal\\nfording point a millennium later, the river could have changed much between\\nJacob\\'s day and when better records were kept later. Third, we do not know\\nwhere along the hills of Gilead Laban finally overtook Jacob. Four hundred\\nyears later that area was given to two and a half of Israel\\'s twelve\\ntribes. At that time, it was generally to the east of the Sea of Galilee.\\nBut it is possible that in Jacob\\'s day the area nominally extended north\\nfor a distance. Thus, our best effort is an estimated 400 miles from\\nLaban\\'s ranch to the point where he overtook Jacob.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWhen God told Jacob to return home He added, \"I will be with you\" (Genesis\\n31:3). Jacob would have divine protection. Nevertheless, Jacob had to plan\\nhis escape carefully. He waited until Laban would be shearing his sheep\\nseveral days journey away from the ranch. He sent for his wives (possibly\\nas Laban was setting out) to join him for a secret meeting in the fields.\\nLaban\\'s household must not know. Jacob made his case for fleeing. Once his\\nwives consented each began the extensive preparations for the journey\\n(keeping their secret from Laban\\'s people).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Moving Sheep and Goats</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nJacob\\'s first concern would be to get the sheep and goats moving because\\nwith nursing young they could hardly do ten miles a day. Cattle are good\\nfor twice that while camels can be used for rapid travel. Since Scripture\\nstates that Laban overtook Jacob in the hills of Gilead after a seven-day\\npursuit and this appears to have been nearly 400 miles, the flocks must\\nhave been on the road at least 40 days. So how does this work?\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nOnce Jacob secured his wives agreement to leave Laban, he would have worked\\nat getting the flocks across the Euphrates. This means he would have\\naccompanied the shepherds for this most difficult task. If his flocks were\\nalready grazing a three days\\' journey west of Laban\\'s ranch, he would have\\nspent most of a week getting them to and safely across the Euphrates. He\\nwould not be missed at the ranch as he was often in the fields with the\\nflocks for periods of time.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nToday, for several miles near Carchemish the Euphrates divides into two\\nchannels with an island between the channels. Possibly at one place one\\ncould wade across the first channel, then find a shallow part of the second\\nchannel somewhere else to wade across. We don\\'t know. Only the Scripture\\nmakes a point of saying that Jacob got all he had across the Euphrates.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThen he would cover the distance back to the ranch in two days to get his\\nherds on the trail. This may have taken another week. By then the sheep and\\ngoats, divided into many flocks, would be 160 miles from the ranch (7 + 2 +\\n7 = 16 days). Then Jacob would continue his plans to flee with his\\nremaining household-wives, children, kindred and servants-closing out their\\nlives in Haran and preparing for the long, perilous journey ahead. Possibly\\na trusted servant had been moving back and forth between the flocks, herds\\nand ranch (on camel back) while Jacob\\'s household prepared. By one excuse\\nor another to Laban\\'s people he may have been able to send off donkey\\ntrains of possessions during that week. When they were ready, possibly a\\nweek or so after the cattle left, Jacob\\'s wives must have said their\\ngoodbyes. With that Jacob put his family on camels and his household moved\\nout. Laban\\'s people sent a runner to tell Laban. By this time the sheep\\nwould be 230 miles away (16 + 7 = 23 days).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nCamels were the finest all-around transportation in this part of the\\nancient world. In a caravan with heavy loads, they typically covered 25\\nmiles a day or three miles an hour. They actually could walk all day at\\nfour miles an hour, but to conserve their energy, the drivers walked rather\\nthan rode. This slowed the caravan down to the pace and endurance of the\\ndrivers. Camels had been known to travel a hundred miles a day when\\nemployed for military purposes.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Laban\\'s Pursuit</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nOn the third day Laban received word that Jacob had fled. Laban was\\nshearing sheep. For Laban to take action, he first arranged care for the\\nsheep being sheared, then made the three-day journey back to the ranch and\\nthen organized an armed pursuit party on camels. Jacob would have about a\\nten-day head start but that would not alarm Laban since the sheep with\\nrecently born lambs could only travel ten miles a day at most. What Laban\\nhad not counted on was that Jacob had sent the sheep ahead before returning\\nto the ranch. By the time Laban was ready to pursue, the sheep were on the\\ntrail the equivalent of 33 days, 330 miles from Haran (23 + 3 +2 +3 + 2 =\\n33 days). Meanwhile the herds had been on the trail 17 days so they would\\nsoon catch up with the flocks. Jacob and family had been on the trail ten\\ndays and were a good 250-300 miles from Haran. With camels they would soon\\ncatch up with the flocks, herds and donkey trains.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nScripture says it took Laban seven days to overtake Jacob. Just days\\nbefore, Jacob\\'s cattle, donkeys and camels had all caught up with his\\nflocks and they were now in the hill country of Gilead, 400 miles from\\nHaran. Just as Jacob thought he was safe, Laban and his band appeared.\\nWhile Laban had expected to find them just 170 miles from his ranch, it\\nprobably did not take him long to learn they were a great distance ahead of\\nhim so he would have gone into a forced day and night march. Even so for\\nLaban to cover 400 miles in seven days, his camel army would have had to\\ncover a punishing 55 miles a day. What an amazing flight on Jacob\\'s part.\\nWhat an amazing pursuit on Laban\\'s part.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nNevertheless, it was not that Jacob had reached familiar ground that\\nprotected him but none other than God Himself who appeared to Laban in a\\ndream and warned him not to harm Jacob. In the end Laban and Jacob\\ncovenanted not to cross into each other\\'s lands for harm. Laban kissed his\\ngrandchildren and daughters and returned home. Again, the angels of God\\nappeared to Jacob. (Genesis 32:1). God was doing as He had originally\\npromised at Bethel.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Esau Advances with 400 Men</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThen Jacob learned that his twin brother Esau was coming with a small army.\\nHe sent everyone ahead and was left alone. Yet he was not alone. He\\nwrestled all night. The struggle was both spiritual and physical.\\n\"Wrestling\" suggests a night of fervent prayer. Yet he sustained a lifetime\\nphysical injury. In the end his opponent said \"Your name shall no longer be\\ncalled Jacob, but Israel, for you have striven with God and with men, and\\nhave prevailed.\" (Genesis 32:28). The new name has the connotation of power\\nwith God. Following this Jacob said, \"I have seen God face to face and yet\\nmy life has been delivered\" (Genesis 32:30). Jacob had encountered the\\npreincarnate Christ.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nEsau and his 400 men arrived. It looked like the end. Instead, \"Esau ran to\\nmeet him and embraced him and fell on his neck, and kissed him, and they\\nwept\" (Genesis 33:4). Of this Jacob said: \"I have seen your face, which is\\nlike seeing the face of God, and you have accepted me\" (Genesis 33:10).\\nEach visitation from God strengthened Jacob\\'s faith.\\n</p>\\n<h4>\\nDinah\\'s Humiliation\\n</h4>\\n<h4>\\nInstead of returning to his father in Hebron, for some unexplained reason\\nover the next 12 years Jacob first built a house in Succoth, then bought\\nland and settled in Shechem. There his daughter Dinah \"went out to see the\\nwomen of the land\" (Genesis 34:1). Dinah was now old enough to socialize\\nwith the village women. The text does not mention an escort. Genesis 34:2\\ncontinues: \"When Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the\\nland, saw her, he seized her and lay with her and humiliated her.\" Having\\neleven older brothers she was used to receiving a lot of attention from\\nboys and undoubtedly knew how to give and take a lot of innocent\\nplayfulness. Whatever he saw attracted him like a fly to flypaper. Then he\\nlost control.\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\nAt the least we can observe that Dinah acted indiscreetly. \"Going out to\\nsee the women\" suggests inexperience, an enlarging of her world. In all\\nthis visiting she must have met Shechem. She was poised, self-confident, a\\ntalker and playful. Maybe Shechem misinterpreted her innocent fun for\\nsomething more. We have suggested she was fifteen years old. If she were\\nolder, she would know more about men outside of her family and be more\\ncareful. If she were much younger, she would be less desired as his wife.\\nAt fifteen she was a grown woman capable of marriage and suitable as a mate\\nfor the young prince. Fifteen fits the Scriptural chronology.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nDinah had six natural older brothers while Jacob\\'s other five sons were her\\nstep-brothers. Her oldest natural brother and Jacob\\'s first was Reuben. He\\nwas ten years older than her. Her brothers were beyond indignant. Shechem\\nloved Dinah and asked his father to get her for his wife. When Shechem\\'s\\nfather asked Jacob to let his daughter marry his son, he said the two\\npeoples could become one. Jacob\\'s sons said the Hivites would have to be\\ncircumcised first. So, all the men of the village were circumcised. Then\\ntwo of Dinah\\'s natural brothers came and murdered all the men when they\\nwere in the most pain. These brothers, Simeon and Levi, were 23 and 22,\\neight and seven years older than Dinah.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThinking the sons had to be older people ask, \"How could two young men kill\\nall the men in an entire village?\" First, they came on the third day when\\nthe men were sore. Intense pain can incapacitate. The village men had no\\nstrength to fight back. Second, this question reinforces an earlier\\nsuggestion in this paper, that Abraham had gained military training in Ur.\\nWhen he left Ur, he trained every able-bodied male in his household in the\\nart of defense. When the Jordan Valley was invaded and Lot was taken\\nprisoner, Abraham \"led forth his trained men, born in his house, 318 of\\nthem&#8230;\" and with allies, completely vanquished an experienced,\\nprofessional army (Genesis 14:14). That a 23- and 22-year-old could put an\\nentire village to the sword suggests Jacob also trained his sons in the use\\nof the sword. Today 23- and 22-year-old college football players display\\nthe kind of strength and determination that Jacob\\'s sons displayed. The\\nother side sees the need for the sons to be seven years older, but they\\ndidn\\'t need to be 30 and 29 to wreak this havoc on the village.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWhile the slaughter at Shechem possibly doubled Jacob\\'s wealth, his focus\\nwas on his and his family\\'s survival. He was angry and terrified expecting\\nrevenge from the Shechemites\\' fellow Canaanites. Little did he know that\\nGod would command Israel to destroy the Canaanite population five hundred\\nyears later. Could it be that the act of Simeon and Levi was divine\\njudgment to break the hold of paganism on its surviving residents (over\\nhalf of its population) and give them the opportunity to meet the true God\\nand receive eternal life?\\n</p>\\n<h4>\\nReturning to Bethel, the \"House of God\"\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\nAfter Simeon and Levi slaughtering the adult males of the village, all of\\nhis sons plundered what was left and took the wives and children. Jacob was\\nappalled at his sons\\' action. He said to Simeon and Levi, \"You have brought\\ntrouble on me by making me stink to the inhabitants of the land, the\\nCanaanites and the Perizzites. My numbers are few, and if they gather\\nthemselves against me and attack me, I shall be destroyed, both I and my\\nhousehold\" (Genesis 34:30). Jacob must have cried out to God because we\\nnext read \"God said to Jacob, \\'Arise, go up to Bethel [Hebrew: beth-house;\\nel-God; thus \"house of God\"] and dwell there. Make an altar there to the\\nGod who appeared to you when you fled from your brother Esau\\'\" (Genesis\\n35:1). God said to \"dwell there,\" not \"stop there\" or \"visit there.\"    <em>HB</em> finds he lived there for at least two years, until Joseph\\nreached the age of 17, and possibly as many as three.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBethel would be a place of refreshment after years of stress and trouble.\\nJacob would find peace and quiet in the House of God. He told his household\\nand all who were with him, \"Put away the foreign gods that are among you\\nand purify yourselves and change your garments. Then let us arise and go up\\nto Bethel, so that I may make there an altar to the God who answers me in\\nthe day of my distress and has been with me wherever I have gone\" (Genesis\\n35:2-3). With him were his household plus many new faces--all those in the\\nplunder of Shechem for Scripture previously reported: \"They (Jacob\\'s sons)\\ntook their (Shechem\\'s) flocks and their herds, their donkeys, and whatever\\nwas in the city and in the field. All their wealth, all their little ones\\nand their wives, all that was in the houses, they captured and plundered\"\\n(34:28-29).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nEveryone with him was to put away their false gods, follow rites of\\ncleansing and change their clothes in preparation for meeting the LORD.\\nJacob buried these instruments of idolatry near Shechem and left for Bethel\\n(Genesis 35:4). Along the way the Canaanites did not attack them. Instead\\n\"a terror from God fell upon the cities that were around them, so that they\\ndid not pursue the sons of Jacob\" (Genesis 35:6). At Bethel he built an\\naltar which indicates animal sacrifice and worship. The women and children\\nof Shechem had been the pitiful victims of idolatry. Here they learned\\nabout the true God. He must be approached through the blood of a sacrifice\\nas man had done since the time of Abel. Each Old Testament sacrifice\\nanticipated the ultimate and final sacrifice, that of Jesus Christ on the\\ncross. Certainly, many of these newcomers believed in the true God and\\nentered His Kingdom that day.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBethel was where God had first repeated to Jacob the promises of people and\\nland He had given to Abraham and Isaac. In addition, God had promised that\\nJacob would return to this place. Now Jacob was again in this place. God\\nhad kept His promise. But not only had Jacob returned to this place, he had\\nreturned with a vast household and great wealth.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nFor the sake of continuity, Scripture next records God\\'s second appearance\\nto him at Bethel. Then it continues with Jacob\\'s journey back to Isaac,\\nrelating the death of Rachel near Bethlehem. Finally, Jacob reaches Hebron.\\nScripture closes this portion with the death of Isaac. In the next section\\nScripture tells about Joseph\\'s rise in Egypt and Judah\\'s family, both\\nessential to Israel\\'s becoming a nation and continuing the line of Christ.\\nBut <em>HB</em> seeks to show that the dates of Scripture provide a sound\\nchronology without changing what it says. For this reason, the events that\\nhappened in Bethel are grouped together before the journey to Hebron.\\nScripture gives at least three clues: Joseph was 17 when his brothers sold\\nhim; Judah\\'s marriage occurred \"at this time\" and Jacob built a pillar, not\\nan altar when God appeared to him the second time. Each of these clues\\ncould consume considerable space, but <em>HB</em> will give them briefly\\nand let the reader fill in the details.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Joseph-17 years old</strong>\\n. He and Dinah were 15 when Dinah was violated and God told Jacob to go to\\nBethel and live there. Joseph was brilliant. Because Jacob was worn out, he\\nbegan using Joseph to report on his brothers\\' management of Jacob\\'s vast\\nflocks and herds. He reported his brother\\'s incompetence. They hated him,\\nsold him into slavery and dipped his clothing in blood. Jacob concluded his\\nson was killed by wild beasts and was crushed with grief. Since only two\\nyears is available after Shechem, Joseph\\'s apparent death had to have\\nhappened at Bethel. His mother was still alive and Benjamin had not yet\\nbeen born. Joseph saw Benjamin for the first time when his brothers brought\\nhim to Egypt. Scripture says Jacob grieved over Joseph and would not be\\ncomforted. This event broke Jacob and caused him to return to Hebron and\\nthe consolation his home would provide.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n\"<strong>At that time</strong>\" (Genesis 38:1) begins the story of Judah\\'s\\nmarriage and family. It happened during the days Joseph was dreaming of\\ndominance over his brothers and parents, during those two years when Joseph\\nwas Jacob\\'s eyes and ears. Joseph was 15 when they arrived at Bethel and 17\\nwhen his brothers sold him. Judah being six years older than Joseph was\\n21-23 during the Bethel years. It couldn\\'t have happened much earlier\\nbecause it happened around the time that tragedy befell Joseph. It couldn\\'t\\nhave happened much later because Egypt was just 22-23 years off and Judah\\nwould raise and marry off two sons during those 22-23 years.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>God\\'s second appearance</strong>\\n. God had confirmed the Abrahamic Covenant to him at this very place when\\nhe left home for Haran (Genesis 28:10-22). Now 32 plus years later God\\nrepeated those promises:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    <sup>11</sup>\\n    I am God Almighty [El Shaddai]: be fruitful and multiply. A nation and\\n    a company of nations shall come from you, and kings shall come from\\n    your own body. <sup>12</sup>The land that I gave to Abraham and Isaac,\\n    I will give to you, and I will give the land to your offspring after\\n    you. Genesis 35:11-12.\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nGod identified Himself as \"El Shaddai,\" the all-powerful God. No less than\\nthe One who created all things in six days stood behind these promises to\\nAbraham, Isaac and now Jacob. Further, God confirmed his new name \"Israel\"\\nfirst given over 12 years before when he had wrestled with God all night.\\nHe hadn\\'t been living up to his new name in Shechem. Now that he was living\\nin Bethel, he was finally being \"Israel\" and God acknowledged that. This\\ndivine appearance happened after Jacob built the altar and offered\\nsacrifice on it when his troop first arrived. This is clear because in\\nresponse to this appearance, Jacob set up a pillar of stone and poured out\\nboth a drink offering and oil on it.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBut there were tears even at Bethel. There Deborah, Rebekah\\'s nurse died\\nand was buried under an oak. The place was named \"Allon-bacuth\" (oak of\\nweeping; Genesis 35:8). Possibly this woman had cared for Jacob in his\\ninfancy and his mother as she aged. It is likely that when Rebekah died,\\nher nurse came to help with all the children born to Jacob. In Jacob\\'s\\nhousehold she became a pleasant reminder of his years in his parent\\'s home.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>From Bethel to Hebron and finally to Egypt </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nCrushed by the loss of Joseph Jacob headed for home. More grief visited the\\ndisheartened band. Jacob\\'s beloved Rachel went into labor near Bethlehem\\nwhich was then called Ephrath. Rachel had prayed for another son (Genesis\\n30:24) and now God answered. The child Benjamin lived, but his mother died\\nin childbirth. This was Jacob\\'s twelfth and last son. Over a thousand years\\nlater Micah would prophecy that the most significant son in all human\\nhistory would be born there. The second person of the godhead, God the Son,\\nwould become clothed with humanity in that very place.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBut you, O Bethlehem Ephrathah, who are too little to be among the clans of\\nJudah, from you shall come forth for me one who is to be ruler in Israel,\\nwhose coming forth is from of old, from ancient days. Micah 5:2.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIn a single verse (Genesis 35:22) Scripture reports another disheartening\\nevent. His oldest son committed fornication with his beloved wife\\'s\\nhandmaid, Bilhah. It was like violating the memory of Rachel. Scripture\\ncalls her \"his father\\'s concubine.\" Most likely, Bilhah bore some of\\nJacob\\'s daughters. We don\\'t hear any more of this until Jacob blesses his\\nsons on his death bed. There he says to Reuben,\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<sup>3</sup>\\nReuben, you are my firstborn, my might and the firstfruits of my strength,\\npreeminent in dignity and preeminent in power. <sup>4</sup>Unstable as\\nwater, you shall not have preeminence, because you went up to your father\\'s\\nbed; then you defiled it-he went up to my couch! Genesis 49:2-3.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nFinally, Jacob arrived \"at Mamre, or Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron), where\\nAbraham and Isaac had sojourned\" (Genesis 35:27). He had been away for 34\\nyears, the 20 with Laban plus the 14 in Shechem and Bethel. He had left\\nhome at the age of 74. Now he returned at the age of 108. During his\\nabsence Esau lived for a time with his parents, Isaac and Rebekah, who must\\nhave harbored a deep, quiet grief for Jacob. Esau no longer had to compete\\nwith Jacob who seemed unmatchable. As he became the sole heir of all his\\nfather had, he mellowed. Apparently, he eventually showed interest in the\\nstories of God\\'s appearances to his father and grandfather and finally\\nbelieved. When Jacob returned from Haran, Esau had welcomed him home with\\ntears, forgiving his brother who had purchased his birthright and stolen\\nhis father\\'s blessing. God honored Esau with an entire chapter of the\\nBible, a long one at that, devoted to a 500-year record of his descendants\\n(Genesis 36).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nJacob enjoyed his father\\'s company for just 12 years (1898-1886 BC).\\nGenesis 35:28-29 report, \"Now the days of Isaac were 180 years. And Isaac\\nbreathed his last, and he died and was gathered to his people, old and full\\nof days. And his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.\" Jacob was 120. Eight\\nyears later famine struck. Jacob was infirm but still surrounded by his\\nfamily and still in control. What happened next requires the context that\\nfollows.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe Ishmaelites had sold the slave Joseph to Potiphar, captain of Pharaoh\\'s\\nguard. Potiphar quickly realized Joseph was a good administrator and put\\nhim in charge of all he possessed. His wife found Joseph handsome. When\\nJoseph refused her overtures, she falsely accused him and Potiphar placed\\nhim in the special prison where Pharaoh\\'s prisoners were kept. Again, his\\ngenius was apparent and he came to be in charge of the prisoners. Then\\nJoseph interpreted Pharaoh\\'s dream and was made the governor of Egypt. Over\\nthe next seven years of plenty, due to his administrative skills the\\nstorage facilities of Egypt came to overflow with grain. Then began the\\nseven years of famine and the arrival of his brothers. After shrewd\\ntesting, disclosed himself to them with tears.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSince five years of famine remained, Joseph invited his family to move to\\nEgypt. Pharaoh gave Jacob prized land in the Nile Delta (Goshen) nearest\\nCanaan. Jacob appeared before Pharaoh and said he was 130 years old.\\nScripture identifies all his descendants who ended up in Egypt. Counting\\nJacob the party numbered 70 (Genesis 46:8-27). The Book of Exodus opens by\\nrepeating the names of Jacob\\'s sons in Egypt and giving the same number for\\nhis party found in Genesis 46:27 (70). Jacob died 17 years later at the age\\nof 147 (Genesis 47:28).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Lessons from Jacob\\'s Genealogy</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n1. Use of the term \"son.\" In totaling the sons of each of Jacob\\'s four\\nwives, Scripture says \"these are the sons of&#8230; Leah\" (v15), \"Zilpah\"\\n(v18), \"Rachel (v22) and \"Bilhah\" (v24). In the list are sons, grandsons\\nand even great grandsons. Also included in the count of sons borne by Leah\\nis her husband, Jacob. Obviously, \"son\" can have a wider meaning than in\\ntypical genealogies. The various uses of kinship terms is the subject of\\nthe next chapter.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n2. Focus on sons. Of the 69 named individuals who descended from Jacob and\\ncomprised his household in Egypt, 67 were sons and just two were daughters.\\nSpecifically, it says that Leah bore 33 sons and daughters, even though it\\nlists only one, Dinah. Seriah in verse 17 is the only other daughter found\\nin the list. In using \"daughter\" in the plural, Scripture indicates that\\nother daughters were born but are not listed. Since over time the number of\\nsons and daughters balance out, several dozen daughters could have been\\nomitted for this supposedly complete list.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n3. Focus on the future. In two clear cases unborn sons are listed. Perez\\'s\\nsons, Hezron and Hamul, were born years after the move to Egypt since Perez\\nhimself was born at the time of the move. Benjamin was just 22 at the time\\nof the move, yet ten sons are listed for him. Most would have been born\\nafter the move. Why would a genealogy list unborn sons? This list shows\\nthat God is beginning the fulfillment of his promise to make Abraham\\'s\\ndescendants without number.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBecause of these obvious differences from typical genealogies, unless the\\nBible interpreter thinks of genealogies as Hebrews did, he will make\\nincorrect interpretations.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAppendix Tables 4.1 and 4.2 compile Jacob\\'s genealogy. A highly accurate\\nlist is possibly because Scripture gives so much detail to Jacob\\'s life.\\nTable 4.1 points out that whereas 38 specific dates or details are recorded\\nconcerning Isaac, 80 are found for Abraham and 158 relate to Jacob. Table\\n4.2 dates with a high degree of reliability 30 specific details or events\\nin his life producing an extremely accurate chronology.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWith HB\\'s study of the lives of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, a reliable\\nhistorical chronology can be established back to the birth of Abraham\\'s\\nfather, Terah. Working backwards from the construction of Solomon\\'s temple\\nin 966 BC, the Exodus occurred 480 years before (1446 BC). Jacob moved his\\nfamily to Egypt 430 years before that (1876). He was born 130 years before\\n(2006 BC). Isaac was born 60 years before that in 2066 BC and Abraham was\\nborn 100 years before Isaac (2166 BC). Finally, Terah was born 130 years\\nbefore Abraham (2296 BC). These numbers are found in Table 3.1. Tables B.1\\nand B.2 use HB\\'s findings of 35-55 generations missing between Eber and\\nPeleg to produce historical chronologies both forwards and backwards\\nbetween creation and the present.\\n</p>\\n<br clear=\"all\"/>\\n<p>\\n<strong> </strong>\\n</p>\\n<div>\\n<br clear=\"all\"/>\\n<hr width=\"33%\" size=\"1\" align=\"left\"/>\\n<div id=\"ftn1\">\\n    <p>\\n        <a href=\"#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\" title=\"\">\\n            <sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup>\\n        </a>\\n        Merrill F.

Most importantly, God himself established\\nthem.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIn elegance they can be a long list of immediate father-son relationships\\nor as brief as \"Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham\"\\n(Matthew 1:1).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nProfound-they identify the fathers of post-Flood people groups that\\nrepopulated the world.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nMysterious-they speak of ten sons accompanying 24-year-old Benjamin to\\nEgypt (a 24-year-old with ten sons?). Further, they include the two unborn\\nsons of baby Perez among the 66 descendants of Jacob who went down to\\nEgypt.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nFlexible-they are not always a record of immediate father-son\\nrelationships; rather, they are elastic enough to include future\\ndescendants under the concept that all future generations are in the loins\\nof their forefathers. In this way the record could be particularly tailored\\nto meet the author\\'s purpose with remarkable efficiency.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIn purpose and function they provide identity and explanation-who am I?\\nWhere do I belong? How did it happen? With brevity they record: 1) the\\nspread of man after the Flood; 2) Abraham\\'s ancestors; 3) Israel\\'s\\norganization.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nA three-tier division of Jacob\\'s descendants (tribe/clan/household) insured\\nbrilliant organization and maximum security in the wilderness and fair\\ndivision of the land in Canaan. In effect, the genealogies told each family\\nwhere to pitch its tent in a camp of 2.5 million people and where to settle\\ndown in the spacious Promised Land. They especially confirm that Jesus was\\ntruly human. While biblical genealogies have similarities to the\\ngenealogies of monarchial societies through the ages, they also have\\nsignificant differences and must be explained in a way consistent with\\nbiblical use.\\n</p>\\n<h4>\\nGenealogies Organized Israel\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\nFree at last; no longer slaves under the yoke of Egypt. But what would keep\\nthese former slaves from exploiting each other as they had been exploited?\\nIn a word, genealogies. The ex-slaves had to think and act like free people\\nand stand together as a nation. To keep them from destroying each other\\nbefore they learned those new ways, genealogies helped organize them so\\nthey would live together in a civilized way.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWhen God delivered Israel from Egypt, He gave Moses an amazingly simple yet\\nefficient way to organize the people. He grouped them by tribe, clan, and\\nhouseholds that contained even smaller divisions. At the center of the camp\\nin the wilderness was the Tabernacle. Surroundit was an open area large\\nenough to assemble the nation. Beyond that the three clans of Levi camped\\non three sides of the Tabernacle while the families of Moses and Aaron\\ncamped in front. Beyond the Levites was an assembly area for common\\nactivities. Beyond this, possibly a mile from the Tabernacle, began the\\ncamps of the people. Three tribes camped side by side on each of the four\\nsides, radiating out like wedges. Each tribe was divided into three to six\\nclans, approximately 50-60 clans in all. Clans ranged from 10,000 to 50,000\\nmembers. Divisions further extended to thousands, hundreds and tens. Adult\\nmales provided the basis for population counts.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nEach person living in his own unit restrained theft and promoted acceptable\\nbehavior. Everyone knew the people around them. Their neighbors were their\\nrelatives. Each witnessed the other\\'s actions. Due to distances, people in\\none tribe had little association with people in another tribe. The life of\\neach person centered around where his genealogy put him. Those Levites over\\nthe age of 50 were spared transporting the Tabernacle and became the guards\\nat the heart of the nation. If an unauthorized person entered that inner\\ncircle, he was to be executed-except on those occasions where individuals\\nor the entire nation were summoned to join Moses at the Tabernacle which\\nwas also called \"The Tent of Meeting.\" One didn\\'t just wander anywhere\\nthrough the camp. People were born, married and died in their own\\norganizational unit.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSo, a person\\'s genealogy told him who he was, where he belonged, where he\\nplaced his tent and who his neighbors would be. Slaves could be ornery,\\nstubborn. Sometimes it took a whip to keep them in line. Now the whip was\\ngone. Genealogies were doing what the whip had done. Yes, the people were\\nfree from servitude in Egypt, but their freedom had limits. They didn\\'t\\nhave to work for others twelve hours a day and they didn\\'t have to spend\\ntheir days confined to the work area of a slave gang, but God put an\\nimpressive amount of structure in their lives. Can we picture it?\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWhen this sea of people arrived at a new location, they set up their unit\\nin relation to the whole. Tribal and clan leaders designated areas for\\ntents, established corridors, marked and cleared open spaces for manna,\\ndesignated the special places outside the camp and set up necessary\\nservices for the function of each unit. With practice they became\\nefficient. The Tabernacle, first assembly space, Levite tent area and\\nsecond open area must have stretched a mile in every direction from the\\ncenter, the Tabernacle. Then came the tribes divided into clans and clans\\ndivided into households radiating out for another three miles or so.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nTo be sure, there was more desirable real estate. The tribal and clan heads\\npitched their tents nearest the Tabernacle. Those of lesser position tented\\nfurther out in their clan\\'s living space. If the farthest tents were four\\nmiles from the Tabernacle, all people could collect at the Tabernacle and\\nreturn to their tents the same day. This walk probably motivated families\\nto earn the right to camp closer to the front of their tribe\\'s wedge. This\\ndensely packed part of the camp would cover an area of over 50 square miles\\n(4<sup>2</sup>*3.14).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nJoshua 7:24 says Achan had \"oxen, donkeys and sheep.\" If these animals were\\nkept in the camp their manure would foul the manna and the camp would be\\nhopelessly spread out. More likely the herds and flocks were kept in\\nspecially designated areas outside the camp proper. Other specially\\ndesignated areas would have been used for temporarily unclean individuals,\\nfor lepers, for burying the dead or disposing of waste, among others. These\\nspecially designated areas could have occupied a band three miles wide\\noutside the living area. A camp 14 miles in diameter would have an area of\\n150 square miles, the inner 50 for living and the outer 100 for specially\\ndesignated functions. This vast distance explains why people mostly lived\\nand mixed within their designated areas-tribes, clans, households, etc.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Daily Life in the Wilderness</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nPicture the people rising early to gather their daily portion of manna.\\nTheir desire for manna that was still fresh before the heat of the day\\nspoiled it would have been adequate motivation to brave the nippy early\\nmorning desert cold. Perhaps each person spent the first hour or more\\ngathering a day\\'s worth. In this way God saw to it that each individual\\nreceived sufficient daily exercise. If one area was gathered clean, people\\nwould have to search for areas that still had a supply. Manna was a perfect\\nfood but the effort required to gather it most likely limited over eating\\nand thus becoming overweight.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThen people would relax while they enjoyed the first meal of the day and\\nchatted about the daily tasks needing attention. Young children would\\nrequire the attention of mothers. Just carrying water might occupy a teens\\nmorning. Waste had to be carried to designated areas and buried. Others\\ngathered wood, bartered and traded services and cooked meals while the\\n600,000 men of the camp conducted their morning military drills. Herds and\\nflocks were cared for. Professions and specialties were developed. Maybe\\nall this was done before the sun was high in the sky and it was time for a\\nlong afternoon nap. There were many special days, days for instruction,\\ndays for their religious life and plenty of time to get into trouble for\\nthose so inclined. So went life for that vast multitude, thankfully\\nprotected by cloud from the burning daytime sun and by the pillar of fire\\nduring the cold desert night.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nMoses had an army to train and command. Like all generals he needed to know\\nhow many troops were available for the day. Most likely it was a day for\\ntraining, but it might be a day for action. He must have taken a \"morning\\nreport\" as military commanders generally do. How would it work? Possibly at\\na certain time the horns were blown at headquarters for the morning report.\\nThe horns at each tribe a mile from the Tent of Meeting would repeat the\\ncall. Those in charge of ten had already made the rounds to determine the\\nable bodied. When the horns sounded, each sprinted off to his captain of\\n100 with his report.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe captain of 100 made a quick tabulation and hurried to the next level,\\nthe captain of a thousand. Those reports went to the clan leaders who most\\nlikely were near the tents of the tribal leaders. The tribal leaders made\\ntheir tallies and sent them with runners to the Tent of Meeting. Possibly\\nthis was all accomplished in just half an hour. The officials at the Tent\\nof Meeting tabulated the twelve tribal reports. Moses and his staff\\ndetermined the training activities for the day. The trumpets sounded a\\nsecond time and the available men, usually over 600,000, did as the trumpet\\ncalls directed. Most likely, they assembled in front of their tribe, in the\\nspace between the Levites and the general body of people. There they\\ncarried out the orders of the day.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nGod began this consciousness of being a nation with His original call to\\nAbraham when He told him he would become a nation. God repeated this idea\\nto Isaac and again to Jacob: \"Do not be afraid to go down to Egypt, for\\nthere I will make you into a great nation.\" Genesis 46:3. A record of those\\nwho went down to Egypt with Jacob is preserved in Genesis 46:8. Jacob\\'s\\nsons became the tribes of Israel. Clans and households arose from their\\ndescendants. Through the growth of a family, a nation was developing.\\n</p>\\n<h4>\\nDifficulties in Following Genealogical Lists\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\nUntangling Hebrew genealogies is challenging. The challenge begins with the\\nperson\\'s name. Generally, just one name is given for a particular Hebrew in\\nany given passage. Imagine how difficult it would be to keep people\\nstraight if everyone was \"David\" or \"Mary\" or \"Bill\" in today\\'s society.\\nOne helpful device was naming certain people along with their father\\'s name\\n(\"Joshua the son of Nun;\" \"Caleb the son of Jephthunnah\"). Some names were\\nquite popular even then so various people answered to the same name. In\\nfact, more than one person answered to many of the names found in the Old\\nTestament and in one case twenty-three people found in Scripture bore the\\nsame name. Families gave their sons the name of a beloved grandfather or\\nfamous ancestor. Abraham\\'s grandfather and brother both bear the name\\n\"Nahor.\" Sometimes people were named after places special to families.\\nTerah named Abraham\\'s oldest brother, Haran, after the city by that name.\\nTo further complicate matters, some Hebrews were known by several names, so\\nvarious authors used different names for the same person.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nPerhaps writing material was scarce or expensive, so Hebrew authors\\npracticed brevity and efficiency in listing descendants. Because relational\\nwords (father, son, daughter, brother, sister) could be used narrowly or\\nbroadly, when we read \"son of,\" for instance, it is often impossible to\\nknow if a particular list is condensed or complete. Thus, one cannot assume\\nthat the same name in two different places is the same individual or that a\\nlist of names is always inclusive. This is the most difficult challenge in\\nsorting out Hebrew genealogies and the one that has led to the most\\ndistorted notions that claim to be based on the Word of God. This book\\nwould not be written if well-meaning, inerrancy-believing rank-and-file\\nChristians had discerned that Hebrew genealogies were more often\\nabbreviated than not.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nHaving seen how, on the one hand, genealogies provided identification, but\\non the other hand are difficult to sort out, we will now turn to their use.\\nFirst, we will look at the use of basic relational terms-father, son, etc.\\nImmediately we are in for a shock until we learn to think the way Hebrews\\nused those words. There was no word for \"grandson\" so the single word \"son\"\\ncovered all possibilities. A normal reaction will be skepticism, so\\nnumerous examples follow. Then we will proceed to more difficult (and more\\nunbelievable) ways Hebrews rendered lists of their descendants. For\\ninstance, the total number of those going down to Egypt with Jacob included\\nunborn sons on the one hand and omits most of the daughters on the other\\nhand, even though we read, \"All the persons belonging to Jacob who came\\ninto Egypt, who were his own descendants, not including Jacob\\'s sons\\' wives\\nwere sixty-six persons in all\" (Genesis 46:26).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBuilding on this foundation, we take up case after case of abbreviated\\ngenealogies in chapter six. Wouldn\\'t two or three examples do? Few are\\niron-clad. While this author has rendered his best judgment, some examples\\nmay be legitimately questioned. But with a preponderance of examples, the\\ncase becomes overwhelming.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe light is coming. We have been encouraged by recently printed statements\\nin standard young earth creation periodicals like \"OK, maybe Israel was in\\nEgypt 430-years, not 215,\" and \"yes, perhaps, on occasion, Hebrew\\ngenealogies are abbreviated.\" The thinking of young earth creationists is\\ngoing in the right direction. But we believe ample evidence exists that\\nShem\\'s list in Genesis 11 also is condensed. Finally, with great reverence,\\nwe must realize that our Savior\\'s genealogy is a Hebrew genealogy and it,\\ntoo, is a matter of identity, not completeness.\\n</p>\\n<h4>\\nSimple Hebrew Vocabulary\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\nBiblical Hebrew had no words for relationships like grandfather, grandson,\\nuncle, cousin, etc. The standard relationship words were words father,\\nmother, son, daughter, brother and sister. So, when the word father was\\nused, it might mean immediate father, but it also might mean grandfather or\\nmore distant ancestor. In the same way when the word son was used, it might\\nmean immediate son, grandson or more remote descendant. The women said,\\n\"Naomi has a son,\" when in fact Ruth\\'s baby was Naomi\\'s grandson (Ruth\\n4:17). The first verse of the New Testament says \"Jesus, son of David, son\\nof Abraham,\" when later verses show that Jesus lived many generations after\\nDavid and David lived many generations after Abraham.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe verb \"to bear/to beget\" (Hebrew-YLD) was used in the same general way.\\nThe one born might be the immediate offspring or a more distant offspring.\\nBut we only had four examples of YLD referring to a more distant offspring,\\nso we sent an email to the Biblical Hebrew Dictionary asking if they could\\ngive further examples. We asked, \"How could we be sure that YLD was used in\\nthe broad sense?\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nArie Uittenbogaard of Abarim Publications wrote, \"Common knowledge. In\\nHebrew father- and motherhood extend beyond the primary biological\\ngeneration.\"<a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\" title=\"\">[1]</a> In effect\\nthis man was saying that examples are unnecessary. Among users of Hebrew,\\nit is common knowledge that the verb \"to bear/to beget\" can be used for\\nboth immediate and later generations. As previously stated, the Hebrew\\nconcept is that all future generations are in the loins of the present\\ngeneration and therefore the present generation produces all future\\ngenerations. Thus, the Hebrews used these basic relational terms in both\\nnarrow and broad senses while more specific relationship terms are used\\ninmost other languages.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nFlexible/elastic. A Hebrew genealogy could (and often did) contain both\\nimmediate descendants and more distant descendants without any indication\\nthat some intermediate generations were omitted. We can conclude this\\nbecause of what we have already seen as well as what we are about to see\\nagain and again. Our original example was that of Kohath-Amram-Aaron which\\nreads like they were immediate father-son relationships. While Amram was\\nthe immediate son of Kohath, a number of unnamed sons stood between Amram\\nand Aaron.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nMoses wrote his older brother\\'s genealogy in Exodus six. He knew who their\\nparents were and most likely every forefather back to Levi. But he did not\\nname them all. There was no need. An abbreviated list adequately showed\\nAaron\\'s roots and thus where he belonged in the organization of Israel. So,\\nMoses named their forefather who was a grandson of Levi and their\\nforemother who was a daughter of Levi. Amram and Jochebed were highly\\nvisible ancestors among Jacob\\'s descendants. That connection made Moses and\\nAaron legitimate descendants of noted stock in Israel. Their lineage was\\nbeyond any challenge.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nNo one disputes that relational words are used in the Bible in a general\\nsense such as \"the sons of Israel\" where all the descendants of Jacob are\\ncalled \"sons.\" But it is less well known that they are also used widely in\\na broad sense when individuals are spoken of. Such misunderstanding leads\\nto grave misinterpretations of Scripture. Thus, there is a great need to\\nsee numerous examples of this use of relational words.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe following section provides such examples. While those familiar with the\\nBible will immediately understand many of the examples, explanation is\\ngiven so that all may understand. First a simple example is given of each\\nrelational category used in a broad sense; then more complex examples are\\nprovided. Further insights will be developed as examples are explored.\\n</p>\\n<h3>\\nExample of Each Kinship Term Used in a Broad Sense\\n</h3>\\n<p>\\n<strong><u>To Beget/To Bear</u>.</strong>\\nUse of the Hebrew verb <em>beget/bear</em> (YLD) in a broad sense:    <strong></strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nJochebed bore [YLD} to Amram Aaron and Moses and Miriam. Numbers 26:59.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe three children Jochebed bore to Amram were actually descendants born\\neight to twelve generations later. The Hebrew concept was that all\\ndescendants were in the loins of their forefathers. Statements of specific\\nacts such as \"to begat/to bear\" are used accurately and literally to\\ndescribe such distant relationships.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong><u>Father</u></strong>\\nused for both a father and grandfather in the same verse:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAnd David said to him, \"Do not fear, for I will show you [Mephibosheth]\\nkindness for the sake of your father Jonathan, and I will restore to you\\nall the land of Saul your father, and you shall eat at my table always.\" II\\nSamuel 9:7.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nMephibosheth was the son of David\\'s dear friend Jonathan and the grandson\\nof Saul, the first king of Israel. Yet David calls both men Mephibosheth\\'s\\nfather, showing how Hebrews easily used the term \"father\" for immediate and\\nmore distant direct forefathers.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong><u>Mother.</u></strong>\\nUse of the concept of <em>mother</em> in a broad sense:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    He [Asa] also removed Maacah his mother from being queen mother&#8230;.\\n    I Kings 15:13.\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nMaacah was the mother of King Asa\\'s father and the grandmother of King Asa.\\nHowever, of all the various filial terms, \"mother\" is seldom used broadly.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong><u>Son</u></strong>\\n. Use of the noun <em>son</em> in a broad sense:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n[Jacob asked,] \"Do you know Laban, son of Nahor?\" Genesis 29:5.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nActually, Laban was the son of Bethuel and grandson of Nahor. Most likely\\nJacob mentioned Nahor rather than Bethuel because Nahor was the forefather\\nof many people in the area and would be well known. In case the shepherds\\ndid not know Laban, they could at least point Jacob in the right direction\\nto where Nahor\\'s people lived.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong><u>Daughter</u>.</strong>\\nUse of the noun <em>daughter</em> in a broad sense:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBut Naomi said, \"Turn back my daughters, why will you go with me?\" Ruth\\n1:11.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nNaomi was speaking to her two daughters-in-law. They were not her children.\\nThis is the use of daughter in a wider sense than being the mother of these\\ntwo women.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong><u>Brother/Sister</u></strong>\\n. Use of the nouns <em>brother</em> and <em>sister</em> in a broad sense:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSay to your brothers, \\'You are my people,\\' and to your sisters, \\'You have\\nreceived mercy.\\'\" Hosea 2:1.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIn the anticipation of fulfilled prophecy, Hosea foresaw that the people\\nwould call the men of the nation <em>brothers</em> and the women of the\\nnation <em>sisters</em>. This is the same type of broad sense of    <em>sister</em> as is found in Sons of Israel using <em>son</em> in a broad\\nsense.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe above verses illustrate seven relational concepts used in a broad sense\\nin biblical Hebrew-<em>to beget/to bear, father, mother, son, daughter, brother</em> and    <em>sister</em>. Next we will examine more complex examples of the broad\\nuse of these relational words.\\n</p>\\n<h3>\\nExamples with More Complexity\\n</h3>\\n<p>\\n<strong><u>To Beget/To Bear</u></strong>\\n(YLD). This common Hebrew verb is used for a mother\\'s bearing of both a\\nson, four grandchildren and even a granddaughter.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<sup>17</sup>\\nThe sons of Asher: Imnah, Ishvah, Ishvi, Beriah, with Serah their sister.    <sup>18</sup>These are the sons of Zilpah, &#8230;and these she bore to\\nJacob. Genesis 46:17-18.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe list of Jacob\\'s family going down to Egypt is arranged according to his\\nfour wives. Asher was a son of Jacob sired through Zilpah, Leah\\'s handmaid.\\nThe list names four sons and a daughter for Asher but then summarizes by\\nsaying Zilpah bore these children to Jacob when actually the only child\\nborn by Zilpah in this list was Asher. The passage also calls all five\\ngrandchildren sons when one was a granddaughter.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe idea of bearing a child who is actually a grandchild or more distant\\ndescendant is foreign to western thinking and therefore shocking to modern\\nreaders. Our first such example was that of Amram and Jochebed begetting\\nMiriam, Aaron and Moses. Here is a second instance of bearing referring to\\nsomeone other than an immediate offspring.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWhile this broad use of the concept of \"to bear, to beget\" is unfamiliar to\\nmost, Hebrew language scholars such as noted scholar and commentator C.F.\\nKeil acknowledged it many years ago. He wrote of the high priestly line of\\nAaron, \"[YLD, the Hebrew word for \"beget/bear] in the genealogical lists\\nmay express mediate [in contrast to immediate] procreation, and the\\ngrandson may be introduced as begotten by the grandfather.\"    <a href=\"#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\" title=\"\">[2]</a>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong><u>To Beget/To Bear</u></strong>\\n-other examples: Deuteronomy 4:25 and Isaiah 39:7 quoted in II Kings 20:18\\n(speaks of sons born to Hezekiah but these sons were born generations\\nlater, not the immediate sons born to him or even his grandsons or great\\ngrandsons).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong><u>Father.</u></strong>\\nUse of the noun <em>father</em> in a broad sense:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nYou shall&#8230;[say], \"A wandering Aramean was my father. And he went down\\ninto Egypt and sojourned there, few in number, and there he became a\\nnation, great, mighty, and populous.\" Deuteronomy 26:5.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nMoses was speaking of Jacob when he told the 2.5 million people who lived\\nhalf a millennium after Jacob to say \"A wandering Aramean was my father.\"\\nHe was teaching the Israelites to be humble about their roots, that it was\\nGod and not their forefather who was the source of all their blessings,\\nmaking them a nation and giving them the Promised Land. In the broad sense\\nof the word \"father,\" every descendant of Jacob could call him \"father.\"\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong><u>Father</u></strong>\\nused for the ancestor of various later descendants:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    <sup>3</sup>\\n    The LORD was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the earlier ways of\\n    his <u>father</u> David; <sup>2</sup>[Hezekiah] did what was right in\\n    the eyes of the LORD, according to all that David his <u>father</u> had\\ndone; <sup>7</sup>Do not be like your <u>fathers</u>&#8230;.        <sup>8</sup>Do not now be stiff-necked as your <u>fathers</u>\\n    were&#8230;. II Chron. 17:3; 29:2; 30:7-8. (Underlining ours.)\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nDavid was the forefather of kings Jehoshaphat and Hezekiah who lived many\\ngenerations later. Nevertheless, David is called their father. King\\nHezekiah urged his subjects to turn from the wicked deeds of their fathers\\nwhich included generations of departure from the feasts prescribed in the\\nLaw of Moses. Four times the term \"father\" refers either in part or\\nentirely to those who were separated by at least one generation from their\\nimmediate father.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong><u>Father</u></strong>\\nreferring to the original patriarchs of the Jewish people:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSee, I have set the land before you.

Deuteronomy 1:8.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBe strong and courageous, for you shall cause this people to inherit the\\nland that I swore to their fathers to give them. Joshua 1:6.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<sup>2</sup>\\nThus says the LORD, the God of Israel, \"Long ago, your fathers lived beyond\\nthe Euphrates, Terah, the father of Abraham and of Nahor, and they served\\nother gods. <sup>3</sup>Then I took your father Abraham from beyond the\\nRiver&#8230;.\" <sup>14</sup>Put away the gods your fathers served&#8230;,    <sup>15</sup>Choose this day whom you will serve, whether the gods your\\nfathers served in the region beyond the River&#8230;. Joshua 24:2-3, 14-15.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIn each of these three examples the people being spoken to are the\\ngeneration that occupied the Promised Land. They are reminded that God had\\npromised the land to the Patriarchs of Israel-Abraham, Isaac and Jacob who\\nlived 500-600 years before-and their descendants. These Patriarchs are\\ncalled the peoples\\' fathers. In the strict sense, a person can have only\\none father. Yet here even Abraham\\'s idolatrous father Terah is called their\\nfather. Clearly \"father\" is used in the broad sense here. As in the case of\\n\"son\" referring to the entire nation, no one questions this use of \"father\"\\nas it occurs so frequently. Why then should it be surprising that \"father\"\\nwhen applied to a single \"son\" could also be used in a broad sense?\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong><u>Father</u></strong>\\nused in a broad sense even for non-Jewish peoples:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    <sup>1</sup>\\n    King Belshazzar&#8230;. <sup>2</sup>Nebuchadnezzar his father&#8230;.\\n    Daniel 5:1-2.\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBelshazzar was actually the son or son-in-law of Nabonidus who was the son\\nof Nebuchadnezzar. Critics have used this verse to claim the Bible is in\\nerror. But obviously Daniel was using \"father\" in the typical Hebrew broad\\nsense. Inerrancy-minded Christians are not the only ones who have not\\nunderstood the Hebrew practice of using filial terms in a broad sense.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong><u>Father</u></strong>\\n-further examples of the broad use: Genesis 31:3; Deuteronomy 1:8; II Kings\\n18:3; 22:4; I Chronicles 24:19; II Chronicles 28:27, 29:2, 34:3; Nehemiah\\n2:8.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong><u>Son</u></strong>\\nused for both an immediate son and a distant male descendant:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAnd Shebuel the son of Gershom, son of Moses, was chief officer in charge\\nof the treasuries.

Hezron was a son of Perez\\nand therefore a grandson of Judah. Perez\\'s twin brother, Zerah, had a\\ndistant descendant name Carmi, the father of Achan who troubled Israel in\\nthe time of Joshua. Hur and Shobal were sons of Hezron and thus great\\ngrandsons of Judah. Yet all are listed as sons of Judah. Clearly, the term\\n\"son\" was very flexible in Hebrew genealogies.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong><u>Son</u></strong>\\nused for a specific distant descendant:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAnd the priest, the son of Aaron, shall be with the Levites when the\\nLevites receive the tithes.

Aaron, the founder of this family, was\\nborn around 1500 BC. This example comes from the time of Nehemiah, about\\n500 BC where the priest is called \"the son of Aaron.\" Obviously, the priest\\nwas a distant descendant of Aaron. The term \"son\" does not convey an\\nimmediate father-son relationship in Nehemiah 10:38.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong><u>Son</u></strong>\\nused in the broad sense of a distant descendant of a clan leader:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAnd Joshua and all Israel with him took <u>Achan the son of Zerah</u>, and\\nthe silver and the cloak and the bar of gold&#8230;.

God said Israel had sinned; they had transgressed His covenant. The\\nguilty party was to be found and executed. God gave three levels of search:\\ntribe, clan and household.

When\\nthe four clans of Judah passed, the clan of Zerah was taken. When the\\nhouseholds of that clan passed, the household of Zabdi was taken.\\nEventually the soldier named Achan was taken. He confessed and was\\nexecuted. Altogether the clans of Judah numbered 76,500 soldiers according\\nto Numbers 26:22. Yet the passage calls Achan the son of Zerah even though\\nhe was just one of thousands of soldiers in that clan. The writer knew\\nthis. He did not make a mistake. He clearly gave the basic descent of\\nAchan, beginning with his tribe, clan, and household as was the custom\\nbefore skipping down to his father and him saying, \"Achan, the son of\\nCarmi, the son of Zabdi, son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken\"\\n(Joshua 7:18).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong><u>Son</u></strong>\\n-other examples of the broad use: Exodus 12:35, 37 (\"son\" translated\\n\"people\"); Numbers 26:5-40, 32:40, 41; Joshua 5:3, 17:6; II Samuel 9:9-10\\n(twice); I Chronicles 6:44, 50; II Chronicles 29:12-14, 29:21, 31:19,\\n35:14-15-3x; Ezra 2:1-14, 3:10; Nehemiah 10:39; 11:4-9, 22-24; 12:23, 47.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong><u>Daughter</u>.</strong>\\nUse of the noun <em>daughter</em> in a broad sense:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nNone of the daughters of Israel shall be a cult prostitute.

All his offspring he brought with him into Egypt.    <sup> 8</sup>Now these are the names of the descendants of Israel, who came\\ninto Egypt&#8230;. <sup>12</sup>The sons of Judah: Er, Onan, Shelah, Perez,\\nand Zerah (but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan); and the sons of\\nPerez were Hezron and Hamul. <sup>21</sup>And the sons of Benjamin: Bela,\\nBecher, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppin, Huppin, and Ard.    <sup>26</sup>All the persons belonging to Jacob who came into Egypt, who\\nwere his own descendants, not including Jacob\\'s sons\\' wives, were sixty-six\\npersons in all. Genesis 46:5-8, 12, 21, 26.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nGenesis 46:7 states that Jacob \"brought all his offspring with him into\\nEgypt.\" Each offspring is named and counted. Yet some were not yet born.\\nThese unborn offspring could have been born up to 40 years after the move.\\nThey were grandsons and possibly even great grandsons. The list includes\\nnot only Perez but his two sons-Hezron and Hamul (Genesis 46:20). Since\\nPerez himself was just born or maybe not yet quite born when they moved,\\nhis two sons would not be born until Jacob\\'s family had been living in\\nEgypt 20-30 years. We might think the writer was deceptive to include\\nunborn children in the list, but that is because we are judging by the way\\nwe look at genealogies. What was important to God was to establish the\\nforefathers of the sons of Israel in the minds of the Jewish people.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBenjamin was born after Simeon and Levi massacred the men of Shechem. God\\ntold Jacob to move his family to Bethel. From there they moved to Isaac at\\nMamre (Hebron) and along the way, near Bethlehem, Rachel died giving birth\\nto Benjamin. Twenty-four years later Jacob moved his family to Egypt, and\\nin the Genesis 46:21 list of those who moved to Egypt are ten sons for\\nBenjamin. While some may have been a scribal error, the rest most likely\\nwere still in the loins of their father. We must conclude that some were\\nBenjamin\\'s grandsons, even though they are found in that list of Jacob\\'s\\noffspring that he took to Egypt.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nNaming and counting unborn children seems strange to us until we realize\\nthat the primary purpose of the genealogies was to bind a nation together\\nby blood. Genealogies identified the members of the nation and gave them a\\npowerful glue that is the marvel of the world to this day. No other nation\\nceased to exist for two millennia and then came back to life as Israel did\\nin 1948. Naming both born and unborn descendants provided a registry from\\nwhich the clans of Israel developed. Apparently, it was important to have a\\nfoundation of names in the registry from the beginning of the sojourn in\\nEgypt. Only God could devise a system that would last nearly four\\nmillennia.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong><u>Undercounting of daughters</u></strong>\\n:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe passage says Jacob took \"his daughters\" to Egypt. Yet only one\\nimmediate daughter, Dinah, is listed and counted in the offspring total of\\n66. On the other hand, neither Jacob\\'s four wives nor any of his sons\\'\\nwives and only one granddaughter are counted in the family total of 70 that\\nended up in Egypt. Stephen has been faulted for saying that \"Joseph sent\\nand summoned Jacob his father and all his kindred, seventy-five persons in\\nall\" (Acts 7:14). Since the party included his four wives, his unnamed\\ndaughters and his sons\\' unnamed daughters, who is to condemn some Rabbi\\nwhose Bible study Stephen attended who counted Jacob\\'s party using\\ndifferent criteria and found the total to be 75, not the 66 number of\\nGenesis 46:26?\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    <u>Ancestors participating in the actions of descendants:</u>\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    <sup>17</sup>\\n    So the field of Ephron in Machpelah, which was to the east of Mamre,\\n    the field with the cave&#8230;was made over <sup>18</sup>to Abraham as\\n    a possession in the presence of the Hittites...

So, it was Jacob, not Abraham who\\npurchased the field in Shechem. Stephen\\'s words in Acts 7:16 appears to be\\na direct contradiction of these facts except for the Hebrew practice of\\nassociating ancestors with the actions of their descendants.

From the tribe of Judah is Jerahmeel\\'s\\nlist of twenty-three generations beginning with Perez and ending sometime\\nin the Period of the Judges. Judah raised two successive families. The\\nsecond was by his Canaanite daughter-in-law Tamar who bore him the twins,\\nZerah and Perez. The only noted descendant of Zerah was Achan, the trouble\\nmaker of Israel. But many famous descendants came from the other twin,\\nPerez, including King David, Caleb the believing spy, Bezelel who was the\\nchief artisan on the Tabernacle and the Lord Jesus Christ. Perez also had\\ntwo sons, Hezron and Hamul. The famous people mentioned above all came\\nthrough Hezron who fathered three sons: Jerahmeel, Ram and Chelubai\\n(Caleb). Jerahmeel\\'s list records 23 consecutive generations extending from\\nthe beginning of the Egyptian sojourn until about 200 years before David.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong><u>Complete genealogy of Jerahmeel</u> </strong>\\n(23 consecutive generations-numbering in brackets):\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<sup>25</sup>\\n[Perez-1; Hezron-2] The sons of Jerahmeel [3], the firstborn of\\nHezron&#8230;. <sup>26</sup>Jerameel also had another wife, whose name was\\nAtarah; she was the mother of Onam [4]. <sup>28</sup>The sons of Onam:\\nShammai [5] and Jada. The sons of Shammai: Nadab [6] and Abishur.    <sup>30</sup>The sons of Nadab: Seled and Appaim [7]. <sup>31</sup>The son\\nof Appaim: Ishi [8]. The son of Ishi: Sheshan [9]. The son of Sheshan:\\nAhlai [10-actually Ahlai is Sheshan\\'s daughter]. <sup>34</sup>Now Sheshan\\nhad no sons, only daughters, but Sheshan had an Egyptian slave whose name\\nwas Jarha. <sup>35</sup>So Sheshan gave his daughter in marriage to Jarha\\nhis slave, and she bore him Attai [11]. <sup>36</sup>Attai fathered Nathan\\n[12], and Nathan fathered Zabad [13]. <sup>37</sup>Zabad fathered Ephlal\\n[14], and Ephlal fathered Obed [15]. <sup>38</sup>Obed fathered Jehu [16],\\nand Jehu fathered Azariah [17]. <sup>39</sup>Azariah fathered Helez [18],\\nand Helez fathered Eleasah [19]. <sup>40</sup>Eleasah fathered Sismai [20],\\nand Sismai fathered Shallum [21]. <sup>41</sup>Shallum fathered Jekamiah\\n[22], and Jekamiah fathered Elishama [23]. I Chron. 2:25-26, 31, 34-37,\\n39-41.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAlthough Jerahmeel had no significant descendants, no less than seventeen\\nverses of Scripture are devoted to them. Why? He was Hezron\\'s firstborn.\\nTime and again the firstborn is featured in the Old Testament merely\\nbecause he was the firstborn. Apparently because so many famous people came\\nfrom Hezron, the historian felt obligated to give all the information he\\nhad on Hezron\\'s firstborn even though he had no famous descendants.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nJerahmeel\\'s longest string has 23 descendants, finally concluding well into\\nthe period of the Judges. By comparison, the line of Ram, Hezron\\'s second\\neldest, reaches all the way from Perez to King David with just ten names.\\nBecause Jerahmeel\\'s line ends somewhere in the middle of the Judges, about\\neight more names would need to be added to reach to David\\'s birth. Clearly,\\nmany individuals are left out in the Perez-Ram-David line which will be\\nexamined in the next chapter.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAbout 40 names are found in Jerahmeel\\'s listing (I Chronicles 2:25-41).\\nBecause it takes some doing to separate out the 23 generations that appear\\nto be continuous, the following commentary is provided. Jacob fathered\\nJudah, his fourth son, who fathered Perez. Judah was about 45 years old\\nwhen his father moved the family to Egypt (1876 BC). Perez could not have\\nbeen born much before this date since he and his twin brother Zerah were\\nborn after Judah had grown from birth in Haran to adulthood in Shechem, had\\nfathered three sons who also grew to adulthood and two had died by the\\njudgment of God, all in those 45 years. Thus, the birth of Tamar\\'s twins,\\nZerah and Perez, had to have occurred very close to the move to Egypt. For\\nsake of convenience, HB reckons their birth to be in the year of the move,\\ni.e., 1876 BC. This starts the generational count not only of Jerahmeel\\'s\\nline, but also that of Perez\\'s other lines leading to Caleb, David, Bezelel\\nand Christ. For convenience the 23 generations are listed below without\\nverse notations:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n1-Perez; 2-Hezron; 3-Jerahmeel; 4-Onam; 5-Shammai; 6-Nadab; 7-Appaim;\\n8-Ishi; 9-Sheshan who had no sons, only daughters, one of whom he gave to\\nhis Egyptian slave Jarha; 10-Ahlai, daughter of Sheshan first called his\\nson then explained that she was really his daughter but that he had no\\nsons; 11-Attai; 12-Nathan; 13-Zabad; 14-Ephlal; 15-Obed; 16-Jehu (whom we\\nsuggest was in the Exodus generation); 17-Azariah; 18-Helez; 19-Eleasah;\\n20-Sismai; 21-Shallum; 22-Jekamiah; 23-Elishama. I Chronicles 2:25-41.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nMost lists have difficulties and Jerahmeel\\'s is no exception. The greatest\\ndifficulty here is determining when it ends historically. Scripturally, the\\nlist ends with \"and Jekamiah fathered Elishama\" (I Chronicles 2:41) before\\nmoving on to \"The sons of Caleb the younger brother of Jerahmeel&#8230;\" in\\nthe next verse. Does this list extend through the Judges or even through\\nthe kings to the Captivity? The text doesn\\'t say.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nOne observation is that the genealogies coming at the beginning of\\nChronicles seem to focus on Israel\\'s earlier history. The strongest clue is\\nthat of the ninth name, Sheshan. He had an Egyptian slave whom he gave to\\nhis daughter to carry on his name since he had no sons. A Hebrew owning an\\nEgyptian slave? When during the 430-year Egyptian sojourn might the\\nIsraelites have been so prosperous and free as to own slaves who were\\nEgyptian in nationality before the Hebrews themselves were reduced to\\nslavery? It needed to be during a time when they enjoyed much freedom and\\nespecially before they became so numerous as to be a threat to Egypt.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nDuring the years of famine Joseph managed the transfer of the land to\\nPharaoh, thereby greatly strengthening Pharaoh\\'s office. Pharaoh showed his\\ngratitude by favoring Joseph and his family with some of Egypt\\'s best\\ngrazing land in the northeast of the Nile delta. Gradually Egypt declined\\nand eventually the northern portion was overrun by the famous Hyksos\\npeople. They, like the Hebrews, were of Semitic stock. The Hyksos needed\\nallies among the defeated Egyptians, so Israel most likely enjoyed a large\\namount of freedom under them. This would have been a favorable period for\\nSheshan to give his daughter Ahlai, who is called \"his son\" in verse 31, to\\nhis Egyptian slave Jarha. This marriage occurs in the tenth generation of\\nPerez through Jerahmeel. At this point in history, we estimate that new\\ngenerations were beginning about every 28 years so the daughter Ahlai would\\nhave been born about 280 years into the Egyptian sojourn or 150 years\\nbefore the Exodus.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSometime later stronger Pharaohs of the eighteenth dynasty arose who drove\\nout the Hyksos. At that point the Hebrews would have been deemed a threat\\nso they were put to servitude. Shortly thereafter Princess Hatshepsut,\\ndaughter of Thutmose I, found and adopted Moses. Hatshepsut went on to\\ncontrol or rule Egypt for nearly a quarter of a century, first on behalf of\\nher sickly husband, Thutmose II, and then on behalf of his infant son,\\nThutmose III, borne by a court woman. Thutmose III is said to have been\\nabout twenty-two when his step-mother died and for the next 30 years he\\nruled Egypt in his own right. He proved to be a powerful Pharaoh who\\nextended the rule of Egypt all the way to the Euphrates.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAt the age of 40 Moses had to flee when he killed the Egyptian because\\nThutmose III would use this crime as a way of removing his rival Moses. Dr.\\nMerrill points out that this Pharaoh is the only one to rule Egypt for\\nforty years until Ramses II who ruled 200 years later and therefore the\\nonly Pharaoh to fit the timeline of Moses during a considerable stretch of\\nEgyptian history.<a href=\"#_ftn4\" name=\"_ftnref4\" title=\"\">[4]</a> God kept\\nMoses in the wilderness forty years until the next pharaoh, Amenhotep II,\\nsucceeded Thutmose III.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nReturning to our timeline, if Sheshan\\'s slave is correctly dated, the 16th\\ngeneration of Jerahmeel would be the generation that left Egypt in the\\nExodus. That leaves the final seven generations for the first half of the\\n480 period from the Exodus until Solomon\\'s Temple. Thus, Jarehmeel\\'s line\\nfalls about ten generations short of Solomon\\'s reign or nine of David\\'s.\\nDr. Keil generally supports this view, being of the opinion that\\nJerahmeel\\'s line ended somewhere near the end of the period of the Judges.    <a href=\"#_ftn5\" name=\"_ftnref5\" title=\"\">[5]</a>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIn conclusion the line of Jerahmeel seems to indicate that about 33\\ngenerations are involved in the time from the beginning of the Egyptian\\nsojourn and the birth of Perez until the beginning of Solomon\\'s reign.\\nThese 33 generations cover a period of some 906 years (1876-970=906).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong><u>Complete genealogy of Heman</u> </strong>\\n(19 consecutive generations-numbering in brackets):\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<sup>31</sup>\\nThese are the men whom David put in charge of the service of song in the\\nhouse of the LORD after the ark rested there. <sup>33</sup>Of the sons of\\nthe Kohathites: Heman [1] the singer the son of Joel [2], son of Samuel\\n[3], <sup>34</sup>son of Elkanah [4], son of Jeroham [5], son of Eliel [6],\\nson of Toah [7], <sup>35</sup>son of Zuph [8], son of Elkanah [9], son of\\nMahath [10], son of Amasai [11], <sup>36</sup>son of Elkanah [12], son of\\nJoel [13], son of Azariah [14], son of Zephaniah [15], <sup>37</sup>son of\\nTahath [16], son of Assir [17], son of Ebiasaph [18], son of Korah [19],    <sup>38</sup>son of Izhar, son of Kohath, son of Levi, son of Israel. I\\nChron. 6:31, 33-38.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nOur second example of a complete genealogy provides what the first did\\nnot-a precise ending point as well as a precise starting point. When Jacob\\ntook his family to Egypt, his third son Levi came with his three sons\\nGershon, Kohath and Merari. Eventually they multiplied into a large tribe.\\nEach of the sons formed a clan. God gave the clans of Levi to assist Aaron\\nfor the ministry of the Tabernacle. Seven hundred years later Samuel and\\neven later David organized the Levites for ministry. After bringing the Ark\\nto Jerusalem David appointed one person from each clan to be a worship\\nleader at the Tabernacle. In the center Heman was to lead the Kohathite\\nsingers. On his right Asaph would lead the Gershonite singers. On his left\\nhand Ethan was to direct the Merari singers.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nTo have had this heavy responsibility Heman needed to be a mature man at\\nthe time of his appointment. In fact, his own family all but filled the\\nchoir loft. I Chronicles 25:5 reports that God gave Heman fourteen sons and\\nthree daughters who were all under the direction of their father\\'s musical\\nwork in the house of the LORD. Yet he not only served in David\\'s day but\\nlived to serve in Solomon\\'s day as well. David brought the Ark to Jerusalem\\nafter his first seven years of rule in Hebron which began about 1010 BC. So\\nHeman was maybe slightly older than David; 1000 BC is certainly a ballpark\\nending point for Heman\\'s genealogy. But where did it begin? Actually it\\nbegan with Jacob but what grabs our attention is the name Korah. Korah was\\nthe leader of the rebellion against the leadership of Moses and Aaron and\\nbecomes the reason the story of Heman is so touching.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe story begins shortly after that first year of law-giving in the\\nwilderness so it could be dated to about 1444 BC. God strongly guarded both\\nthe spiritual things of Israel under Aaron and the civil authority under\\nMoses. The severity of punishment for violating those institutions is well\\nknown. A well-meaning man steadied the Ark during transport and God struck\\nhim dead. Anyone without authorization within the tabernacle grounds was to\\nbe put to death. Levites of the clan of Kohath and sons of Reuben found 250\\nprinces of Israel to join them to challenge the authority of Moses and\\nAaron and God struck them all dead (Numbers 16). The camp took the side of\\nthose slain so God sent a plague that consumed thousands. Only the\\nintercession of Moses and Aaron stopped the plague. Eighteen generations\\nlater a descendant of this wicked man Korah became worship leader of the\\nentire nation. What a story of mercy and grace.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe dates are known: the rebellion of Korah about 1444 BC and the Ark\\ncarried to Jerusalem about 1000 BC, a time span of nearly 450 years. The\\nnumber of generations identified in the Heman list for this period is 19.\\nBut Aaron and Korah were in their 80\\'s while David and Heman were in their\\n40\\'s, so one generation must be subtracted from Heman\\'s list. That leaves\\n18 names. In counting the time from one generation to the next, begin\\ncounting with the second person. That leaves 17 names or 26.5 years per\\ngeneration which is well in the ballpark for generations.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nNow we must return to David\\'s list which will be discussed in chapter\\nseven. It is found four times in the Bible, beginning with Ruth 4:18-22.\\nThat list gives ten names starting with the move to Egypt in 1876 BC. The\\nfirst three names are those who lived at the beginning of the 430-years in\\nEgypt-Perez, Hezron and Ram. Then it skips down 300 years to the time of\\nthe Exodus with three more names: Amminadab, Nahshon and Salmon. Amminadab\\nwas the elderly patriarch of Judah. His son, Nahshon was the Prince of\\nJudah whom Moses asked to conduct the second census for Judah. Salmon\\nmarried Rahab after the fall of Jericho. From that point to David is 400\\nyears yet only four names remain in David\\'s genealogy-Boaz, Obed, Jesse and\\nDavid. If there were no omitted generations, that list would represent 100\\nyears per generation. The Heman list not only shows us what a complete\\ngenealogy would look like from the Exodus to the time of worship in\\nJerusalem but it also shows that the David list is abbreviated.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nFinally, the Heman list omits 8-12 generations during the Egyptian sojourn\\njust like the Aaron list did. After beginning with Jacob, it lists\\nLevi-Kohath-Izhar-Korah. Aaron\\'s list follows the same pattern:\\nLevi-Kohath-Amram-Aaron. The first three names in each list are\\nconsecutive. The difference comes with Kohath\\'s sons. Aaron descended from\\nAmram, the first of Kohath\\'s sons while Korah descended from Izhar, the\\nsecond of Kohath\\'s four sons. Kohath and his sons Amram and Izhar lived at\\nthe beginning of the sojourn in Egypt. Aaron and Korah were born 300 years\\nlater near the end of the Egyptian sojourn. The Heman list follows the\\npattern of Aaron\\'s list and therefore confirms Aaron\\'s list by skipping\\n8-12 generations between Izhar and Korah just like the Aaron list skipped\\n8-12 generations between Amram and Aaron.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nHeman\\'s list is ascending, moving back through time from son to father. We\\nwill reverse it to view it the usual way (descending from father to son).\\nWe have removed Heman\\'s three forefathers (Levi-Kohath-Izhar) which we just\\ncovered above:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n1-Korah; 2-Ebiasaph; 3-Assir; 4-Tahath; 5-Zephaniah; 6-Azariah; 7-Joel;\\n8-Elkanah; 9-Amasai; 10-Mahath; 11-Elkanah; 12-Zuph; 13-Toah; 14-Eliel;\\n15-Jeroham; 16-Elkanah; 17-Samuel; 18-Joel; 19-Heman.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nDefenders of the 215-year view see such numbers and are forced to devise a\\nscheme that harmonizes the numbers, oblivious to the nature and purpose of\\nHebrew genealogies. For example, one book says that Judah\\'s first two sons\\nhad children when they were 14 or 15 years old and Judah\\'s twins, Zerah and\\nPerez, likewise had sons when they were still teenagers. Then to bridge the\\nhuge time span from that son to Bezalel, it suggests that each of the next\\nfathers, Hezron, Caleb and Hur had their firstborns when they were in their\\nsixties. Then to bridge the next brief time span, with a straight face this\\ninterpreter says the next generations had their sons when they were 20\\nyears old. The Korah-Heman list assures us that the Hebrew generations\\nduring those centuries were within the range of reason, in this case\\naveraging 26 years per generation.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAlong the line of developing a story to fit misinterpreted numbers, another\\nwriter explained how four generations produced the six hundred thousand men\\nfound in the first census after the Exodus. The writer said it was simple.\\nEach father had many sons, an average of like six sons per father per\\ngeneration. In contrast with this speculation the record tells a different\\nstory. For every male that had six or more sons there was one that died\\nearly or didn\\'t even marry or didn\\'t have children or had just one or two\\nsons.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe other two lines of temple musicians are listed in I Chronicles 6 as\\nwell. However, they do not provide the same measure of certainty as the\\nline of Heman. His line parallels Aaron\\'s line for both his and Aaron\\'s\\nline give the first three generations living in Egypt, then skip down to\\nthe individual in their line who was an older adult at the time of the\\nExodus-Aaron and Korah. But in the case of Asaph and Ethan, we cannot\\nidentify the individual in their line who was contemporary with Aaron and\\nKorah and thus their lines have no clear starting point. Both Ethan\\'s and\\nAsaph\\'s lines become suspect to abbreviation.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    <u>\\n        In summary this chapter uncovered the following characteristics of\\n        Hebrew lines:\\n    </u>\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n1. The biblical genealogies are elegant, profound, mysterious, practical,\\npersonal and flexible in nature.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n2. Genealogies told the Hebrew who he was and where he belonged. They were\\na major element in organizing Israel both in the wilderness camp and in\\nsettling Canaan.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n3. The simplicity of Hebrew names requires great care in tracing lists. For\\nthe most part only a single name is given for an individual though several\\ndifferent names might be used for the same individual in different places.\\nSome names were very popular so many people were known by the same name.\\nPeople were given the names of famous ancestors. (In the translation to\\nEnglish it is sometimes even hard to tell if a name is male or female.)\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n4. Biblical Hebrew contains only basic relational terms such as father,\\nson, daughter, brother and beget. The same word could be used for immediate\\nconnections such as a father and his immediate son or more distant\\nconnections from ancestor to descendant or from descendant to ancestor.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n5. When the biblical text is read these elements appear in all their\\ncomplexity. The company of people who moved to Egypt included the names of\\nunborn sons. A daughter is even called a son. In the same verse a man is\\ncalled the son of both his father and grandfather. I Chronicles 4:1 speaks\\nof the sons of Judah then gives five names-one was a son, one was a\\ngrandson, two were great grandsons and one was a descendant who lived 400\\nyears later.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n6. Scripture provides two apparently complete and lengthy lists-those of\\nJerahmeel and Heman. When David\\'s list is compared with those lists, it is\\nfound to be greatly abbreviated. For instance, during the same time frame\\nthat Jerahmeel\\'s list contains twenty-three names and Heman\\'s list contains\\n19 names, David\\'s list contains six names. These comparisons help us to see\\nthat David\\'s genealogy is greatly condensed. Our next chapter will present\\n14 examples of abbreviated genealogies including several already\\nintroduced. The chapter after that will address the most contentious of all\\ngenealogies, that of Shem.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n7. All these examples were correct uses of the Hebrew in the day they were\\nrecorded. They all reflect the inerrancy and infallibility of Scripture.\\nHowever, they require that the student of Scripture be sensitive to the\\nlanguage in which Scripture was written and understand these lists in terms\\nof the language of that day, not the language of our day.\\n<br clear=\"all\"/>\\n</p>\\n<div>\\n<br clear=\"all\"/>\\n<hr width=\"33%\" size=\"1\" align=\"left\"/>\\n<div id=\"ftn1\">\\n    <p>\\n        <a href=\"#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\" title=\"\">[1]</a>\\n        Abarim Publications online Biblical Hebrew Dictionary.

At first this idea is unsettling, but as we set aside the\\ntypical idea of how genealogical lists should work and allow our minds to\\ninteract with Scripture itself, we will conclude that, indeed, Hebrew\\ngenealogies often left out unnecessary or unknown names. Abbreviating\\ngenealogies made them more efficient and decidedly less tedious. Many\\nexamples follow. <a name=\\\"__DdeLink__5772_1878803623\\\"></a>See the Appendix\\nfor a table to illustrate each example.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAll Hebrews descended from one of Jacob's twelve sons. The name of each son\\nbecame a tribe so all descendants of Jacob were members of one of the\\ntribes. Jacob adopted Joseph's two sons so when Joseph's name is removed\\nand his two sons replace him, Israel had 13 tribes, not 12. But God\\nassigned the tribe of Levi to minister to the spiritual needs of Israel.\\nThat tribe did not fight in the army and it did not have its own portion of\\nthe land. Rather it was scattered throughout the other twelve tribes and\\nsupported by those twelve tribes. As a result, one might think of Israel as\\nhaving twelve normal tribes and one special tribe.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nEach of the 13 \\\"tribes\\\" was further broken down into \\\"clans\\\" as the tribe's\\npopulation grew. In time each \\\"clan\\\" was further broken down into\\n\\\"households.\\\" Population counts usually involved only adult males. Tribes\\nnumbered from 25,000-75,000 adult males; clans numbered from thousands to\\ntens of thousands; households numbered from hundreds to thousands. The\\ngenealogies of those who descended from Jacob usually began with those\\nthree levels of division-tribe, clan and household. At times, the fourth\\nname would be that of the individual to whom the genealogy belonged if the\\nindividual was well known.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThis chapter comes in two versions. First, it summarize each example. Then\\nit will present the list of examples with all their details which include\\nimportant stories.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Example 1 - Aaron, Israel's First High Priest</strong>\\n. Since Aaron was well known just four names expressed his genealogy:\\nLevi-Kohath-Amram-Aaron (Exodus 6:16-20). Levi was his tribal ancestor;\\nKohath was his clan ancestor and Amram was his household ancestor. In this\\nway his genealogy names three immediate individuals that began his line and\\nlived at the beginning of the 430-year sojourn in Egypt then skips down\\nabout 300 years or 8-12 generations to him. Thus, the four names represent\\n12-16 successive fathers.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    Examples 2-7 - Korah, Dathan, Abiram, On, Achan and Zelophehad's\\n    daughters.\\n</strong>\\nEach follows the pattern of Aaron's genealogy with minor exceptions when\\nneeded. Korah, Dathan and Abiram were well known so their list follows the\\npattern of Aaron's list: tribe, clan, household and individual. On was\\napparently less important among the rebels so only his tribe, clan and\\nhimself are given. Achan was not widely known so his father, Carmi, is\\nadded. The daughters of Zelophehad were also not widely known, so their\\ngrandfather as well as their father were added.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWhen stories are included, we can see that genealogies are far more than\\nlists of names. They are historical references to key events and\\nindividuals in the life of the nation divided by timelines and\\ncircumstances. We learn of its struggles, heroes and villains. We learn how\\nGod worked through His people in relationship to their calling as a nation\\nwith its tribes, clans and households. He blessed them; but held them\\nresponsible for their disobedience.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Examples 8-9 -Sheerah and Joshua. </strong>\\n(I Chronicles 7:20-27). These lists are among the most complicated lists to\\nunscramble that can be unscrambled. Expositors see this list of names as\\none continuous line when it actually consists of two lines. Generally\\nunseen, these verses commemorate the lives of two outstanding individuals\\nin the tribe that otherwise was notorious for dividing Israel, the tribe of\\nEphraim. The problem is that a descendant was named Ephraim after the\\ntribal father whose name was Ephraim. The first list contains nine names\\nbeginning with Ephraim number one who was born shortly before 1876 BC and\\nends with the daughter of the Ephraim number two. She was famous for\\nfounding or developing two major towns in Ephraim possibly 500 years after\\nEphraim number one. In verse 25 the writer goes back to pick up another son\\nof Ephraim number one and goes down to Joshua. It also contains nine\\ngenerations. While listing nine generations, each of these lists still\\nomits many generations.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Example 10 - Caleb, the Believing Spy</strong>\\n. He was so famous that Scripture does not give his genealogy so some may\\nobject that the Bible does not abbreviate his list. The objection is sound,\\nbut research gives so many names in his line that much of it can be\\nreconstructed. However, because it still omits names it stands abbreviated\\nas it is given piecemeal in the Pentateuch and Joshua.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Example 11 - King David</strong>\\n. This is almost like presenting four examples because David's line is\\nfound four times in the Old and New Testaments. It is first found at the\\nend of Ruth when she bears a son to Boaz. It begins with Perez who was one\\nof the twins born to Judah about the time Jacob moved his family to Egypt\\n(1876 BC) and concludes with David who died about 970 BC. If this list were\\ncomplete each son would be born when his father was 90. Fortunately, the\\nnames are familiar. In looking at it the first three lived early in the\\nEgyptian sojourn. The next three lived over 300 years later at the time of\\nthe Exodus and conquest of Canaan. Then the list moves down to the end of\\nthe Judges to name three immediate forefathers of David and finally David\\nhimself.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Example 12 -- Israel's Priesthood. </strong>\\nAs with most other genealogical lists, even the priesthood of Israel\\nomitted names at times. This fact emphasizes how Hebrew genealogies were\\nmostly about identity, not about complete lists establishing legal descent.\\nIn contrast historical genealogies in Western societies were precise\\nrecords of descent. While the following example records the genealogy of a\\npriest that omits generations and was presumably written by that priest,\\nScripture contains other examples of omitted names in priesthood records.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Example 13 -- Ezra the Priest and Scribe</strong>\\n. Ezra (7:1-5) omits six consecutive generations in his list when compared\\nto the official list of priests in Chronicles. He had his reasons and they\\nprobably were not associated with efficiency or avoiding tediousness, but\\nhis list clearly omits six names and shows that skipping names in a\\ngenealogy was acceptable in Israel.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Examples 14-16 - The Three Leaders of the Temple Singers</strong>\\n. David appointed Heman as the senior choir director. Heman had both\\noutstanding and shady ancestors. His grandfather was the prophet and judge,\\nSamuel, but the infamous Korah was also in Heman's line. His line follows\\nthe pattern of Aaron's line during the 430-year Egyptian sojourn, omitting\\n8-12 generations. then, from Korah to his own day, it contains 19 names and\\nis complete. It spans the years from the birth of Levi about 1891 BC to his\\nappointment by David about 1000 BC. However, it is complete from the\\nrebellion of Korah about 1444 BC to David. That complete portion contains\\n19 names. On the other hand, the genealogies of the two other choirmasters,\\nAsaph and Ethan, are examples of incomplete lists during that period.\\nAsaph's line contains 12 names and Ethan's line contains 10.\\n</p>\\n<h2>\\nDetails to the 16 Examples Above\\n</h2>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Introduction</strong>\\n. Nearly half of all the Old Testament verses containing genealogies relate\\nto the tribes of Levi and Judah. This makes sense since God chose the tribe\\nof Levi to minister to Israel's spiritual life and the tribe of Judah to\\nsupply its rulers and the Savior. In Example #1 (Levi-Aaron) three\\ngenerations were used to establish a line from the tribal founder, Levi, to\\nthe individual under consideration, Aaron. The organizational plan Moses\\nfollowed was: first level, the tribe of Levi; second level, the clan of\\nKohath (Levi's son); third level, the household level of Amram (Levi's\\ngrandson).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nLevel two, the clan level, is identified by several different titles in\\nvarious parts of the Old Testament. Consequently, some modern authors refer\\nto it as the division level. Scripture also uses several terms\\ninterchangeably for the third level so some authors call this third level\\nthe clan level. For sake of clarity, we will call the first level the tribe\\nlevel, the second level the clan level and the third level the household\\nlevel.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nA refinement that might be overlooked involves counting generations. In a\\nlist each person represents a generation. But when determining changes\\nbetween generations, it takes two generations to produce a change. Thus,\\none must count from the birth of the first to the birth of the second as\\none generation. When working with averages, the average number of years in\\na generation must be determined. Because the length of generations varied,    <em>Hidden Beauty</em> visits this subject multiple times.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nOne cannot presume that the firstborn is always the chosen successor. Judah\\nwas the fourth born of Jacob yet the royal line of Israel was established\\nthrough him, not Reuben, Jacob's firstborn. Aaron's third born, Eleazar,\\ncarried on the line of the high priesthood. Even further, one's firstborn\\nmight be a female as in the case of Mariam being the oldest child of the\\nunnamed parents of Mariam, Aaron and Moses. In counting Aaron's children\\nonly four males are named. The law of averages would suggest he had\\ndaughters as well. If he had four daughters and four sons and they\\nalternated-female, male-his designated heir, Eleazar, would have been his\\nfifth child. Thus, we estimate Aaron's age as 30 when Eleazar was born\\nrather than 25 when he would have begun fathering children.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAs to the length of a generation, 25 is used for an average during this\\nperiod. It began when Jacob's sons started to have children. Chapter seven\\nexplains that human longevity declined 2-8 years per generation from the\\nFlood to the death of Moses. Paralleling this decline, the start of new\\ngenerations declined. In the list of Genesis 11 new generations began every\\n29-35 years. By the time Jacob's sons began having families, new\\ngenerations were starting every 19-28 years. Unusual circumstances, such as\\nJoseph's imprisonment resulting in his first son arriving when he was about\\n36, are noted but not considered average.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Example 1 Details-Aaron</strong>\\n.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<sup>57</sup>\\nThis was the list of the Levites according to their clans:&#8230; of\\nKohath, the clan of the Kohathites;&#8230; <sup>58</sup>And Kohath was the\\nfather of Amram. <sup>59</sup>The name of Amram's wife was Jochebed the\\ndaughter of Levi, who was born to Levi in Egypt. And she bore to Amram\\nAaron and Moses and Miriam their sister. Numbers 26:57-59.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nChapter one demonstrated beyond doubt that the Levi-Aaron genealogy of\\nExodus six and Numbers 26 is an abbreviated or condensed genealogy. It\\nlists only Levi, his son Kohath and his grandson Amram before skipping down\\nto Aaron. The list appears four times (Exodus 6:16-20; Numbers 26:57-59; I\\nChronicles 6:1-3; I Chronicles 23:6, 12-13), always with the same fathers\\nand sons-Levi-Kohath-Amram-Aaron. Levi was the immediate father of Kohath,\\nso Kohath was the immediate son of Levi; Kohath was the immediate father of\\nAmram, so Amram was the immediate son of Kohath; however, Amram was not the\\nimmediate father of Aaron and Aaron was not the immediate son of Amram. Up\\nto twelve generations are omitted between Amram and Aaron.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe text also adds numerous details about individuals in the list. Among\\nthem, the Exodus passage relates that Amram married a woman called Jochebed\\nand that this woman was his father's sister and she bore him Moses as well\\nas Aaron. The Numbers passage adds that she was the daughter of Levi born\\nin Egypt and she bore him Miriam as well as Aaron and Moses. Since Amram\\nwas born in Egypt, he married an aunt who was about his age. His\\ndescendants, Aaron, Moses and Mariam would become central figures in the\\nwilderness wanderings some four hundred years later. Lesson: many details\\ncan be added to an apparent immediate father-son listing even though\\nnumerous intermediate generations are skipped. The details relate to the\\nfirst unborn son, not the named son/offspring.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nFrom the text alone the reader would never guess that Aaron, Moses and\\nMiriam were separated from Amram and Jochebed by many generations. Moses,\\nthe writer, had no intention of deceiving his audience. People of that day\\nknew their national history, so they knew he skipped generations. Moses\\ncorrectly used Hebrew genealogies because their purpose was to knit a\\nnation together. These three descendants of Levi had to be tightly bound to\\nJacob's lineage.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Example 2 Details-Korah</strong>\\n.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<sup>1</sup>\\nNow Korah the son of Izhar, son of Kohath, son of Levi, and Dathan and\\nAbiram the sons of Eliab, and On the son of Peleth [Pallu], sons of Reuben,\\ntook men. <sup>2</sup>And they rose up before Moses, with a number of the\\npeople of Israel, 250 chiefs of the congregation, chosen from the assembly,\\nwell-known men. Numbers 16:1-2.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nNumbers 16:1-2 contains four examples of abbreviated genealogies-Korah,\\nDathan, Abiram and On. Korah was of the tribe of Levi while Dathan, Abiram\\nand On were of the tribe of Reuben. The lists of Korah and of Dathan and\\nAbiram will be examined next. The writer gave the tribe, clan and household\\nidentities of the first three, but omitted the household to which On\\nbelonged. In this way the On listing is the shortest list on record.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe genealogy of Korah follows the basic pattern of tribe, clan and\\nhousehold. Numbers 16:1 tells that Korah, like Aaron, was a descendant of\\nLevi. Further, like Aaron he was from the Levite clan of Kohath. But\\nwhereas Aaron traced his line through Kohath's oldest son Amram, Korah\\ntraced his line through Kohath's second son Izhar. However, merely\\ndiscussing names without faces and actions doesn't grasp the mind like\\nassociating names with specific events. So here is the background.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nKorah got others to join him in challenging the leadership of Aaron and\\nMoses. He envied the honor and privileges of Aaron's position as high\\npriest. He found sons of Reuben who were equally envious of Moses (tribe of\\nLevi) who exercised supreme authority in civil affairs. After all, Reuben\\nwas the oldest son of Jacob, not Levi. Traditionally, family leadership was\\nthe right of the firstborn. Two brothers controlling the entire nation had\\nto be changed. They found 250 princes of Israel to join their uprising.\\nThis delegation marched on the Tent of Meeting to confront Aaron and Moses,\\nundoubtedly accompanied by an unruly mob of supporters.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWith indignation this horde threw down their challenge: \\\"Why do you exalt\\nyourselves above the assembly of the LORD?\\\" (Numbers 16:3). What they\\nforgot was that God had chosen the nation's leaders. In the end God opened\\nup the earth to swallow the rebel instigators and fire consumed the 250\\nprinces. Those 250 princes ranked among the celebrities of the nation. The\\nnext day the entire congregation grumbled against Aaron and Moses, blaming\\nthem for getting their princes killed. God sent a plague. Only the quick\\nintervention of Aaron and Moses prevented the loss of the entire nation. As\\nit was, the plague took the lives of 14,700 people in just hours. The\\ndivinely sent plague abruptly ended the rebellion.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nNumbers 16:1 abbreviates Korah's genealogy. It lists the first three\\ngenerations of the Patriarch Jacob's third son-Levi, Kohath and Izhar-and\\nthen skips down 300 years to Korah. When Jacob moved his family to Egypt\\n(1876 BC), Levi was about 46 years old while his son Kohath's was an\\nestimated 20. Thus, Kohath's sons, Amram and Izhar, belonged to the first\\ngeneration born in Egypt. Like Aaron and Moses, Korah was born over 300\\nyears and up to 12 generations later.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Examples 3-5 Details-Dathan, Abiram, On.</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<sup>5</sup>\\nReuben, the firstborn of Israel; the sons of Reuben: of Hanoch, the clan of\\nthe Hanochites; of Pallu, the clan of the Palluites; <sup>6</sup>of Hezron,\\nthe clan of the Hezronites; of Carmi, the clan of the Carmites.    <sup>7</sup>These are the clans of the Reubenites, and those listed were\\n43,730. <sup>8</sup>And the sons of Pallu: Eliab. <sup>9</sup>The sons of\\nEliab: Nemuel, Dathan, and Abiram. These are the Dathan and Abiram, chosen\\nfrom the congregation who contended against Moses and Aaron in the company\\nof Korah, when they contended against the LORD, <sup>10</sup>and the earth\\nopened its mouth and swallowed them up together with Korah, when that\\ncompany died, when the fire devoured 250 men, and they became a warning.\\nNumbers 26:5-10.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe genealogies of Dathan and Abiram are further identified in Numbers 16\\nbecause of their part in the Korah rebellion. These men were born in the\\ntribe of Reuben, Jacob's firstborn. Due to their role of leaders in the\\nnotorious attack on Moses they are also singled out in the second census of\\nIsrael found in Numbers 26 (above). Whereas the Numbers 26 census mostly\\nlists tribes and clans, in the case of the tribe of Reuben, the census\\nincludes four verses on one household of the Pallu clan, the household of\\nElias (verses 8-11). Then the census tells that Dathan and Abiram were sons\\nof Elias, ie, were descendants of the household of Elias. Without the\\nidentification of their household, we would only know their tribe and clan.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nReuben was about 48 when they moved to Egypt. Pallu would have been about\\n20 since he is listed second among Reuben's four sons. Elias is not listed\\namong those who went down to Egypt, so he would have been the first of his\\nline born in Egypt. Dathan and Abiram were born over 350 years after the\\nbirth of Elias. This notice follows the pattern of listing three\\nconsecutive generations then skipping down to the individual under\\ndiscussion. In doing so it passes over up to 13 generations in the same way\\nthe genealogies of Aaron and Korah passed over up to 12 generations.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nOn is only named in Numbers 16 which records this dangerous rebellion\\nagainst Aaron and Moses. Like Dathan and Abiram, he was a member of the\\ntribe of Reuben. His line is similar to theirs with one exception. Even his\\nhousehold is not given. This is probably due to the other two playing a\\ngreater role in attacking the leadership of Moses. The remaining names are\\nsimply Reuben (tribe)-Peleth/Pallau (clan)-On (individual). His list is\\nabbreviated indeed.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBefore tackling more complicated condensed or abbreviated genealogies,\\nScripture gives four other genealogies that occur during this period-those\\nof Achan, the daughters of Zelophehad, Joshua and Caleb. Each generally\\nfollows the pattern established above: tribe, clan and household. But\\nfurther names are added to those who were unknown.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Example 6 Details--Achan</strong>\\n.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBut the people of Israel broke faith in regard to the devoted things for\\nAchan the son of Carmi, son of Zabdi, son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah,\\ntook some of the devoted things. And the anger of the LORD burned against\\nthe people of Israel. Joshua 7:1.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAchan descended from Judah who raised twins after his first three sons were\\ngrown. Their names were well known; they formed two large clans in Israel.\\nThe more prominent twin, Perez, became the forefather of Caleb the spy,\\nDavid and Jesus Christ. We will learn much of Perez's descendants. The\\nlesser known twin was Zerah and from this son of Judah Achan descended. One\\nof Zerah's sons was named Zabdi. He represents level three, the household\\nlevel, in the organization of Israel.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe twins (Zerah and Perez) were born about the time Jacob moved his large\\nfamily to Egypt so Zabdi would have been born 25-30 years later, say about\\n1850 BC. Achan served with over 600,000 other sons of Israel in Joshua's\\narmy that destroyed Jericho. Thus, Achan would have been military age\\n(between the ages of 20 and 50) at the time of Jericho's fall in 1406 BC.\\nBecause he had considerable livestock and a considerable family, he was\\nmore likely nearer 50 than 20, so he would have been born about 1450 BC or\\n400 years after Zabdi was born (1850-1450=400).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAchan possessed oxen, donkeys and sheep as well as sons and daughters\\n(Joshua 7:24). Possibly his lack of honesty had infected his entire\\nhousehold and had contributed to his prosperity. While the sons of Israel\\ndid not have first and last names, their father's name was sometimes given\\nto help identify them. Since Achan was an obscure thief his immediate\\nfather, Carmi, was named. Carmi did not pass before Joshua and the priest,\\nso most likely he belonged to the generation that died in the wilderness.\\nIf typical he would have been born 25-30 years (1480-1475 BC) before Achan.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nTo summarize, three generations are used to locate Achan's place in Israel.\\nThey are immediate father-son generations (Judah-Zerah-Zabdi). Judah\\nfathered Zerah who fathered Zabdi. Judah was the tribal father; Zerah\\nformed one of the clans of Judah; Zabdi formed one of the households of\\nZerah. So Achan belonged to the tribe of Judah, the clan of Zerah and the\\nhousehold of Zabdi. About 400 years after the birth of Zabdi, Achan was\\nborn. Obviously, many generations came between Zabdi and Achan. We suggest\\n12-16. Only one is mentioned, that of Carmi, Achan's immediate father. Due\\nto the efficiency of Hebrew genealogies Achan's list is shortened by about\\ntwo-thirds.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIt might be helpful at this point to make some observations about Old\\nTestament names. Two men named Carmi are found during this period of\\nIsrael's history. The first was Reuben's fourth son, Carmi, who formed one\\nof the four clans of the tribe that Dathan and Abiram belonged to. The\\nsecond Carmi was Achan's father who lived four hundred years after the\\nfirst Carmi and belonged to a different tribe. He is the Carmi in Joshua\\n7:1 and is otherwise unknown.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nNames were used over and over in Israel and are easy to confuse. The two\\nfamous Calebs in the line of Judah are a well-known example. There are\\nthree Elkinah's in the line of Heman. Fathers named sons after an admired\\nbrother or ancestor. Abraham's brother Nahor was named after their\\ngrandfather Nahor. Unger's Bible Dictionary lists 23 different Azariah's in\\nthe Old Testament.<a href=\\\"#_ftn1\\\" name=\\\"_ftnref1\\\" title=\\\"\\\">[1]</a>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAdding to the challenge of matching the right person with the right name,\\nsome people were known by two or even three different names and sometimes\\nthe spelling is rendered several different ways. (The same is true of place\\nnames which are commonly rendered by different spellings.) Sometimes it is\\nimpossible to tell if the same name found in different places is the same\\nindividual or a different individual. The careful student will keep all\\nthis in mind as he identifies the people in the OT, distinguishing between\\ntentative and positive identifications.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Example 7 Details-The Daughters of Zelophehad.</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThen drew near the daughters of Zelophehad the son of Hepher, son of\\nGilead, son of Machir, son of Manasseh, from the clans of Manasseh the son\\nof Joseph. Numbers 27:1 (cf. Numbers 26:28-33.)\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nZelophehad had five daughters but no sons. His daughters came to Moses\\nasking for the inheritance of their father so that his name would continue\\nin Israel. The LORD said that if a man had no sons, his daughters could\\npreserve his name by receiving his portion of land. Their father belonged\\nto the family of Hepher the son of Gilead, the son of Machir of the tribe\\nof Manasseh. Their recorded line is\\nManasseh-Machir-Gilead-Hepher-Zelophehad-his five daughters-seven\\ngenerations. This follows the pattern we have seen-tribe, Manasseh;\\nclan-Machir; household-Gilead-the typical three level identification\\ntelling an Israelite who he was and with whom he belonged. An additional\\nlevel is included in the daughters of Zelophehad, the family of Hepher.\\nThis event as we shall see set a precedent.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nNow, what are the times involved? Manassah was born shortly before 1876 BC\\nwhile the daughters brought their request to Moses just before his death at\\nthe end of the 40 years in the wilderness. Most likely they had a range of\\nages from 25 to 40 so they were born shortly after the Exodus. Thus the\\ntime span is approximately 430-years. At the rate of 25 years per\\ngeneration their list should contain 17 names. It only contains 6. It skips\\nabout 11. We must conclude that the genealogy of these daughters follows\\nthe standard practice of naming tribe-clan-household and then skipping down\\nto their father, adding only the family of Hepher and that up to 11\\ngenerations are omitted.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    Examples 8 and 9 Overview-Sheerah and Joshua, I Chronicles 7:20-27.\\n</strong>\\nInterpreters are all over the map in their explanations of these verses due\\nto duplication of names, the brevity of the list and the grammatical\\nconstruction. While they are examples of abbreviated genealogies, they also\\nreveal practices previously pointed out-the naming of descendants after\\nforefathers and the compactness of lists. There is yet another reason for\\nincluding this complicated passage: failure to do so allows it to be used\\nto argue against our position. We do not claim to have the final answer,\\nbut the following interpretation makes far better sense than any other we\\nhave seen.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nFirst, we must suggest why the Sheerah and Joshua lists are found in\\nChronicles. Two reasons stand out: first, nine chapters record genealogical\\nrecords that established Israel as a nation and second, each tribe had\\nnotable achievers. Whereas half of the verses in the nine chapters are\\ndevoted to just two tribes, those of Judah and Levi, only ten verses\\n(7:20-29) are devoted to the tribe of Ephraim, one of the smallest but most\\ntroublesome of all the tribes of Israel.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWhile Ephraim would later divide the nation and later yet adopt idolatry\\nwholesale, in the early days it had its proud moments. Sheerah, for\\ninstance, was a famous Ephraimite woman who lived after the conquest of\\nCanaan when Israel was beginning to build a nation. She established\\nsignificant Ephraimite settlements and is listed in vv20-24. Joshua is much\\nbetter known. He succeeded Moses to command the victorious forces of Israel\\nin subduing the Canaanites and is featured in verses 25-27.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Example 8 Details-Sheerah, I Chronicles 7:20-24. </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<sup>20</sup>\\nThe sons of Ephraim: Shuthelah, and Bered his son, Tahath his son, Eleadah\\nhis son, Tahath his son, <sup>21</sup>Zabad his son, Shuthelah his son, and\\nEzer and Elead, whom the men of Gath who were born in the land killed,\\nbecause they came down to raid their livestock. <sup>22</sup>And Ephraim\\ntheir father mourned many days, and his brothers came to comfort him.    <sup>23</sup>And Ephraim went in to his wife, and she conceived and bore a\\nson. And he called his name Beriah, because disaster had befallen his\\nhouse. <sup>24</sup>His daughter was Sheerah, who built both Lower and\\nUpper Beth-horon, and Uzzen-sheerah. I Chron. 7:20-24.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nScripture frankly states that Sheerah's two brothers were killed stealing\\nPhilistine cattle. Israel lived in the hills; the Philistines lived on the\\ncoastal plain. The brothers, Ezer and Elead, showed stealth and initiative\\nbut they violated the territory of Gath, one of the five Philistine\\ncity-states adjacent to the Mediterranean Sea and paid for it with their\\nlives. This theft and their resulting deaths could only have happened after\\nIsrael had invaded Canaan and captured the land God had promised. Israel\\nbegan the campaign for Canaan with the destruction of Jericho in 1406 BC.\\nThe campaign for the land took the next ten or twenty years.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWhat confuses the reader is that Sheerah's father was named Ephraim after\\nthe founder of the tribe of Ephraim who lived 500 years before. This second\\nEphraim was crushed. He had great plans for the land he received in Canaan\\nand his sons were obviously very motivated. Now his plans were shattered\\nbecause he had lost them. Only a daughter remained. His brothers tried to\\ncomfort him but his mourning lasted many days. Maybe he was already an old\\nman with little hope for having another son. Sometime later he saw\\npossibilities in his daughter and made her his heir. Such an action had not\\nbeen possible until the daughters of Zelophehad came to Moses just before\\nhis death about 1406 BC and God revealed that if a man had no sons, only\\ndaughters, he could designate a daughter as his heir. The death of Ephraim\\nnumber two's sons and his subsequent act of making Sheerah, his daughter,\\nhis heir could not have happened until Israel began settling in Canaan.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe error of interpretation comes when commentators confuse Ephraim, the\\ntribal chief who was Jacob's grandson, with his distant descendant by the\\nsame name who came along 500 years later. They see a long list of names in\\nverses twenty through twenty-seven which ends with Joshua and craft a story\\nabout how sons of Ephraim, the tribal chief, went up from Goshen to loot\\ncattle at Gath early in the Egyptian sojourn and eventually Joshua ends\\nthis long list of descendants. They overlook the fact that Scripture says\\nthe two brothers went down, not up to steal the cattle.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nInstead they conclude that here is a complete list from the beginning of\\nthe Egyptian sojourn until the conquest of Canaan 500 years later-up to\\neighteen generations (depending on how they are counted). They conclude\\nthat Scripture does not abbreviate genealogies; families simply had\\ntraditions of marrying early or late and this accounts for the wide\\nvariation in the number of people in different lines. Their explanation\\noverlooks the entire point of the list-that this second Ephraim's daughter\\npioneered two well-known settlements in Canaan after the Exodus and\\nIsrael's conquest of Canaan.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe standard interpretation is based on a poor understanding of these eight\\nverses. Hebrew scholar C. F. Keil states that seeing but one Ephraim in the\\npassage makes it incomprehensible    <a href=\\\"#_ftn2\\\" name=\\\"_ftnref2\\\" title=\\\"\\\">[2]</a>. But even two lists, one\\nending with Sheerah and a second ending with Joshua, though abbreviated,\\noffer far more names than just the two names between Levi and Aaron. These\\ntwo lists provide two more arguments that the Levi-Aaron list is extremely\\ncondensed and at the same time are themselves examples of abbreviated\\ngenealogies.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe portion of Sheerah's line recorded here is:\\nEphraim-Shuthelah/Bered-Tahath-Eleadah-Tahath-Zabad-Shuthelah-Ephraim and\\nhis children-Ezer, Elead, Sheerah and Beriah (three brothers and a sister),\\nnine generations. Where the text reads, \\\"Shuthelah and Bered his son,\\\"\\nbecause it does not say \\\"Shuthelah his son, Bered his son,\\\" it is commonly\\nunderstood that Shuthelah and Bered were brothers, so these two names\\nrepresent one generation, not two. The text does not identify which brother\\nthe line passed through.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBut most amazing of all, the list is not connected to the second Ephraim.\\nYou read correctly. The list concludes, \\\"Zabad his son, Shuthelah his son,\\nand Ezer and Elead, whom the men of Gath&#8230;killed.\\\" The last name in\\nthis unbroken line is Shuthelah, the son of Zabad. The text does not\\nconnect the brothers to the second Shuthelah. Apparently, the story of the\\nbrothers being killed while attempting to take Philistine cattle was well\\nknown, but the biographer did not have the remaining names in the list to\\nlink the second Shuthelah with the second Ephraim and his family. How many\\ngenerations are missing? Our standard of 25 years per generation suggests\\neleven generations are omitted.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIf all the biographer knew was that this second Ephraim was a distant\\ndescendant of the tribal chief named Ephraim, why mention this list at all?\\nIt seems that it is introduced to help the reader place the deaths of the\\nsecond Ephraim's sons in the time of the settlement of Canaan. The point is\\nto get to his daughter who did the notable deed of building those famous\\nEphraimite settlements. She could only become the heiress if his only sons\\nwere dead and God was yet to give him another son.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWe suggest that with the death of her two brothers, her father mourned.\\nLosing both sons was a great loss. Eventually he made his daughter his heir\\nafter the pattern of the daughters of Zelophehad. Sometime later God gave\\nhim another son of whom nothing more is said. But the daughter made a name\\nfor her father. She was a firebrand in the building of those two Ephraimite\\nsettlements and thus became a legend in the tribe of Ephraim.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWhile an unknown number of generations are missing between Shuthelah #2 and\\nthe second Ephraim (we suggest eleven), the writer does give us seven\\ngenerations between Ephraim and Sheerah, which is 3.5 times as many\\ngenerations as the two between Levi and Aaron. This genealogy testifies to\\nthe Levi-Aaron line being extremely abbreviated, but illustrates another\\nreason for abbreviating a line-the writer did not have the names that tied\\nthe second Shuthelah to the second Ephraim.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Example 9 Details-Joshua. </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<sup>25</sup>\\nRephah was his son, Resheph his son [\\\"his son\\\" not found in the Hebrew],\\nTelah his son, Tahan his son, <sup>26</sup>Ladan his son, Amminhud his son,\\nElishama his son, <sup>27</sup>Nun his son, Joshua his son. 1 Chronicles\\n7:25-27.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nContinuing to unravel the complex record of the tribe of Ephraim, \\\"Rephah\\nwas his son\\\" (verse 25) has no connection with verses 23-24 which talks\\nabout a man named Ephraim who lost two sons. Rather, it resumes listing\\nfurther lines from those first introduced in verse twenty. It lists many\\ngenerations and concludes with Joshua who lived in the generation of the\\nman who lost his sons. Thus, \\\"Rephah was his son\\\" is not a continuation of\\nverse twenty-four but is starting over from verse twenty.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nVerse 25 reads, \\\"Rephah was his son, Resheph his son\\\" in the English text.\\n\\\"His son\\\" is missing after \\\"Resheph,\\\" in the Hebrew text. C. F. Keil notes\\nthat such a construction usually indicates the two were brothers.    <a href=\\\"#_ftn3\\\" name=\\\"_ftnref3\\\" title=\\\"\\\">[3]</a> The Hebrews frequently\\nnamed children with pleasant rhyming sounds. \\\"Rephah\\\" and \\\"Resheph\\\" answer\\nto that practice which further strengthens the idea that they were\\nbrothers. The historian is starting over with a new line from Ephraim in\\nverse 20 to show Joshua's lineage. Neither Rephah or Resheph are listed in\\nNumbers 26 as clans of Ephraim; but, in this list is Tahan and a Tahan is\\nlisted in Numbers 26 as the head of an Ephramite clan. Therefore, the\\nsecond Tahan is most likely named after his clan's founder and identifies\\nJoshua's clan. This list then is as follows: Joseph-Ephraim-Tahan-either\\nRephah or Resheph-Telah-Tahan-Ladan-Ammihud-Elishma-Nun-Joshua, eleven\\ngenerations in all.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nLet us compare the generations in Joshua's line to those in Aaron's line.\\nLevi is about seven years older than his brother Joseph. Levi began the\\nAaron line while Joseph-Ephraim began the Joshua line. Aaron was 83 at the\\ntime of the Exodus while Joshua was about 40; so, Joshua's father, Nun,\\nwould be about Aaron's age. Only two names come between Levi and Aaron\\nwhile eight names come between Joseph and Nun. Each name represents a new\\ngeneration. By this measure 3/4ths of the names are omitted between Levi\\nand Aaron.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nConcerning the integrity of Joshua's list, while Scripture does not tell\\nhis clan, it repeatedly identifies him as the son of Nun. We also know\\nbeyond doubt that at the time of the Exodus the chief of Joshua's tribe,\\nthe tribe of Ephraim, was Elishama and five times in the book of Numbers he\\nis said to be the son of Ammihud. The only time these two sets of names\\n(Nun-Joshua and Amminhud-Elishama) come together is in the passage before\\nus, thus adding further certainty to the names in Joshua's line.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nNow an estimate of missing generations in Joshua's line can be made.\\nEphraim was born about 1878 BC while Joshua was born about 1470 BC or 408\\nyears later. At the rate of 25 years per generation, Joshua was born about\\n16 generations after Joseph. Since only eight generations are named, eight\\nare omitted.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Example 10 Details-Caleb. </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWe have examined the genealogy of Joshua, the spy who represented the tribe\\nof Ephraim. Now we tackle the genealogy of the spy who represented the\\ntribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh. But alas, Caleb's genealogy is\\nnowhere to be found! He was so famous in his day that apparently no one\\nneeded his genealogy. Here is the primary record. Combined with other\\npassages they clearly identified him in Israel without requiring a\\ncomprehensive list.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<sup>6</sup>\\nThen the people of Judah came to Joshua at Gilgal. And Caleb the son of\\nJephunneh the Kenizzite said to him, \\\"You know what the LORD said to Moses\\nthe man of God in Kadesh-barnea concerning you and me. <sup>7</sup>I was\\nforty years old [Joshua was 39] when Moses the servant of the LORD sent me\\nfrom Kadesh-barnea to spy out the land&#8230; <sup>9</sup>And Moses swore\\non that day, saying, 'Surely the land on which your foot has trodden shall\\nbe an inheritance for you and your children forever, because you have\\nwholly followed the LORD my God.'\\\" <sup>13</sup>Then Joshua blessed him,\\nand he gave Hebron to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for an inheritance.    <sup>14</sup>Therefore Hebron became the inheritance of Caleb the son of\\nJephunneh the Kenizzite to this day, because he wholly followed the LORD,\\nthe God of Israel. Joshua 14:6-7, 9, 13-14.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAfter God gave Israel the Law at Mount Sinai, Israel moved to the edge of\\nthe Promised Land where Moses sent twelve men to spy out Canaan. Each of\\nthe twelve was a chief from his respective tribe. At the end of 40 days\\nthese leaders returned with their findings. Ten said the land flowed with\\nmilk and honey; but, it was occupied by giants. In comparison, the Hebrews\\nseemed like grasshoppers. They concluded, \\\"We are not able to go up against\\nthe people, for they are stronger than we are\\\" (Numbers 13:31). Two,\\ndisagreed saying, \\\"Let us go up at once and occupy it, for we are well able\\nto overcome it\\\" (Numbers 13:30).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe congregation raised a loud cry and wept that night, saying \\\"Would that\\nwe had died in the land of Egypt...Why is the LORD bringing us into this\\nland, to fall by the sword?...Would it not be better for us to go back to\\nEgypt...Let us choose a leader and go back to Egypt\\\" (Numbers 14:1-4). The\\ntwo spies with the favorable report, Joshua representing the tribe of\\nEphraim and Caleb representing the tribe of Judah, said, \\\"If the LORD\\ndelights in us, he will bring us into this land and give it to us...only do\\nnot rebel against the LORD and do not fear the people of the land, for they\\nare bread for us...their protection is removed from them, and the LORD is\\nwith us, do not fear them\\\" (Numbers 14:8-9).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWith that the congregation prepared to stone Moses, Aaron, Joshua and\\nCaleb. Then the glory of the LORD appeared at the tent of meeting, saying,\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nHow long will this people despise me? And how long will they not believe in\\nme, in spite of all the signs that I have done among them? <sup>12</sup>I\\nwill strike them with the pestilence and disinherit them, and I will make\\nof you a nation greater and mightier than they. Numbers 14:11-12.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIn the face of impending doom Moses pleaded with God, arguing that \\\"If you\\nkill this people as one man, then the nations who have heard your fame will\\nsay, <sup>16</sup>'It is because the LORD was not able to bring this people\\ninto the land that he swore to give to them, that he has killed them in the\\nwilderness'\\\" (Numbers 14:15-16). Moses prevailed. God relented on\\ndestroying the nation but pronounced judgment: none of the men who saw the\\nsigns in Egypt would see the Promised Land, except for the faithful spies.\\nThe congregation would spend one year in the wilderness for each day the\\nspies saw the goodness of the Promised Land. Then God sent a plague that\\ntook the lives of the ten unbelieving spies.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAt this point we must recall the importance of Perez. Perez represented the\\npowerful impact of the tribe of Judah on Israel's history. Perez is made\\nfamous by his son Hezron who fathered Jerahmeel, Ram and Caleb. Their lines\\nis the subject of I Chronicles 2. The chapter lists 23 generations of\\nHezron's firstborn Jerahmeel (Table 5. 1). It gives the genealogy of Ram\\nhis second son all the way down to David. Other lists continue that line to\\nChrist. Of particular interest to us is Hezron's third son Caleb (also\\ncalled Chelubai).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAgain, Perez was born about the time God directed Jacob to relocate to\\nEgypt (1876 BC). Hezron would have been born about 25 years later and\\nCaleb, as Hezron's third son, would have been born about 33 years after his\\nfather's birth (boy, girl, boy, girl, boy; spaced two years apart). The key\\nthat seems to unlock the door to there being two Calebs is the concluding\\nstatement in the extensive genealogical information about the first Caleb\\nin 1 Chronicles 2. Verse 49 says, \\\"And the daughter of Caleb was Achsah.\\\"\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nJust one person bears the name \\\"Achsah\\\" in the Old Testament and her story\\nis most unusual. The second Caleb was 85 when Canaan was conquered and\\nJoshua was parceling it out to the tribes. This Caleb was promised Hebron\\nbecause he followed the Lord fully. Now he was requesting his inheritance\\nand Joshua granted his request. Caleb drove out the giants in one area of\\nHebron, but those in nearby Debir were too strong for him. He promised his\\ndaughter Achsah's hand in marriage to the warrior that conquered Debir. His\\ncousin Othneil was successful and received Achsah.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWhen 1 Chronicles 2:49 says \\\"the daughter of Caleb [Caleb #1] was Achsah,\\\"\\nit is using the word \\\"daughter\\\" in the broad sense of a distant\\ngranddaughter. Since she was in the first Caleb's line, her immediate\\nfather, the second Caleb, would obviously also be in this line. Clearly,\\nthis second Caleb was named after his famous ancestor, the first Caleb.\\nThus, his line begins: Judah-Perez-Hezron-Caleb and ends with\\nJephunneh-Caleb-Achsah, giving seven names in a period that encompasses\\nabout 20 generations. Perez was a part of Judah's second family, born after\\nJudah's three sons had grown up and two had married. We must count these as\\ntwo successive generations, not one. Now we have identified eight\\ngenerations in the line of Caleb the spy.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nNumbers 32:12 and Joshua 14:6 speak of \\\"Caleb the son of Jephunneh the\\nKenizzite.\\\" The Kenazzites were an extended family in the tribe of Judah.\\n\\\"Son of Kenaz\\\" means a descendant of the father of this household, not\\nparticularly an immediate son. All of this suggests more generations,\\nanywhere from one to six or even more. Now we are up to nine to fourteen\\ngenerations in the family of Caleb of the tribe of Judah.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBut we are not done. This first Caleb had a son named Mareshah who named a\\nson Hebron (I Chronicles 2:42). The town of Hebron was extremely important\\nin Jewish history, being Abraham's home after he and Lot separated. It\\nremains to this day the site where he, Isaac, Jacob and their wives were\\nburied. There Abraham enjoyed great favor with God. Apparently, Mareshah\\ntold the story of Abraham's years at Hebron so many times that he ended up\\nnaming a son after that place of great blessing.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThis line of Judah retold the story again and again. When the spy\\nassignments were given out, Caleb who was raised on those stories, managed\\nto be assigned to spying out Hebron. After he gave the good report, the\\nLORD promised that his inheritance would be everywhere he walked in the\\nHebron area. When Joshua divided up the land, he upheld God's promise by\\nassigning the Hebron area to Caleb. If our conjecture is correct, we can\\nadd the names of Mareshah and Hebron to his line: 1-Judah; 2-Judah's first\\nfamily; 3-Perez, part of Judah's second family; 4-Hezron; 5-the first\\nCaleb; 6-Mareshah; 7-Hebron plus Kenaz and five to nine generations\\nsurrounding him and finally, Jephunneh-Caleb-Achsah, a minimum of eleven\\ngenerations and up to twenty generations.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThis list shows us how to take Aaron's list. Between Levi and Aaron are\\njust two names, Kohath and Amram. Here, between Judah, who was born one\\nyear after Levi, and Caleb's father, who was the same age as Aaron, are\\nseven known generations and an undetermined number of missing generations\\nbefore and after Kenaz. If we assume just five generations are unnamed, we\\nhave twelve versus the two in Aaron's line. Aaron's line seems to be\\ncondensed by at least 5/6<sup>ths</sup> when compared to Caleb's line.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nImagine the strain in viewing but one Caleb to uphold a 215-year Egyptian\\nsojourn. Somehow the first Caleb is the only Caleb. He is both the son of\\nHezron and the son of Jephunneh. He lived early in the Egyptian sojourn and\\nhe lived after the Exodus, the 40 years in the desert and the conquest of\\nCanaan. What a difficult position! But a 430-year Egyptian sojourn fully\\naccommodates the spy's line.\\n</p>\\n<h4>\\nTripping up Bible Students\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\nAs we have seen the Hebrews often named sons after famous forefathers or\\nbeloved relatives. In Sheerah's list are three such examples: a first and\\nsecond Ephraim, a first and second Shuthelah and a first and second Tahath.\\nIn Joshua's list someone named a son after the famous Ephraimite clan\\nleader, Tahan, so when reconstructing Joshua's list, both Tahans must be\\nincluded. The Caleb list contains two famous Calebs born 400 years apart.\\nPublished lists that fail to recognize any one of these five duplications\\nraise questions about the inerrancy of Scripture. So these lists are very\\nimportant, not only for the historical data they preserve, but also for\\ntheir contribution to the integrity of Scripture.\\n</p>\\n<h2>\\nDavid, the Bridge (1876-1000 BC), and\\n</h2>\\n<h2>\\nRemaining Examples (1446-950 BC)\\n</h2>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Example 11 Details-David. </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<sup>18</sup>\\nNow these are the generations of Perez: Perez fathered Hezron,<sup>19</sup>Hezron fathered <u>Ram</u>, Ram fathered <u>Amminadab</u>,<sup>20</sup>Amminadab fathered <u>Nahshon</u>, Nahshon fathered<u>Salmon</u>, <sup>21</sup>Salmon fathered <u>Boaz</u>, Boaz fathered<u>Obed</u>, <sup>22</sup>Obed fathered <u>Jesse</u>, and Jesse fathered    <u>David</u>.

I Chronicles 2:5, 9-15. (Underlining\\nours.)\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nDavid's list spans both the Egyptian sojourn and period of the Judges.\\nBecause of the familiarity of certain names in David's ancestry, Hebrew\\npractice could reduce it to just a handful. Of all the names in this list,\\nthe most familiar was that of David himself, Israel's most famous and\\nbeloved king, born about 1040 BC. Another was Nahshon, Prince of Judah, at\\nthe time of the Exodus. Yet another was Boaz, the kinsman-redeemer, who\\nbrought the Moabitess Ruth into the line of Christ, a story celebrated in\\nthe book bearing her name. Perez, the first in David's list, was founder of\\nthe most illustrious clan of Judah. He was born about the time Israel moved\\nto Egypt-1876 BC.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThese are four of the ten names in David's line. The ten span an astounding\\n836 years (1876-1040 BC). At the rate of four generations per century a\\ncomplete list might contain as many as 33 names! Due to adjustments for\\nknown circumstances, we reduce this number to 30, of which 20 are omitted.\\nThis list of exactly ten names is found in Ruth chapter four. It can be\\nfollowed within the longer list of I Chronicles two. The names in these two\\nlists leading to David are identical and in the same order, starting with\\nPerez and concluding with David. They are repeated without change in the\\nlists of Matthew and Luke. This highly abbreviated list was efficient. It\\nproduced a pleasing effect and it made the story flow. It was\\ncharacteristically Hebrew.\\n</p>\\n<h4>\\nThree Groups Separated by Hundreds of Years\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\nUpon examining David's list more carefully it is grouped around three\\nperiods of Hebrew history-three names at the beginning of the Egyptian\\nsojourn, three names at the time of the Exodus 430-years later, and four\\nnames concluding with David, 400 years after that. Those three groups of\\nnames were commonly known to be in a single line of descent. There was no\\nneed to include all the omitted names since the purpose of Hebrew\\ngenealogies was identifying ancestry, not proving it.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe first group should have started with Judah, and the longer lists do\\ninclude him. But in Ruth the list starts with Perez. The name \\\"Perez\\\",\\nJudah's fourth son, was almost synonymous with the name \\\"Judah.\\\" From Perez\\ncame not only the bulk of the tribe's population but its kings, Bezalel the\\nchief Temple artist, Caleb the spy and, most importantly, the promised\\nMessiah. By beginning with Perez, the list in Ruth contains exactly ten\\nnames, a special number in Hebrew culture. This detail further indicates\\nthat the list was abbreviated. From Perez the line went through his son\\nHezron and Hezron's second son Ram. Hezron was Perez's oldest son, so if\\naverage he would have been born 25 years after his father. In contrast,\\nHezron's second son, Ram would have been born about 29 years after his\\nfather (boy, girl, boy, girl; spaced two years apart). This places the\\nbirths of Hezron and Ram at about 1851 BC and 1822 BC.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe second group (Amminadab-Nahshon-Salmon) centers around famous\\nindividuals in the line about the time of the Exodus. The key to their\\ndating is the detail that Amminadab was Aaron's father-in-law. Aaron died\\nat the age of 123 shortly before Israel entered the Promised Land. These\\nnumbers place his birth at roughly 1529 BC (1406+123=1529). Amminadab would\\nhave belonged to the previous generation although he most likely was older\\nthan 25 when he fathered his daughter whom Aaron married.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nNahshon, the immediate son of Amminadab, was the famous Prince of Judah who\\nsupervised the census for his tribe at the time of the Exodus (Numbers 1)\\nand was presumably Aaron's peer. Aaron was 84 at the time, so Nahshon would\\nalso be viewed as about that old except for the fact that he was the\\nimmediate father of Salmon, the third name in this set. The OT does not\\ngive details about Salmon, but Matthew identifies Salmon as \\\"the father of\\nBoaz by Rahab...\\\" (Matthew 1:5). Rahab was the famous resident of Jericho\\nwho hid the two spies at the time of the Hebrew invasion in 1406 BC. As a\\nreward they promised that her family would be spared in the coming Hebrew\\nconquest. A son of Nahshon by the name of Salmon married her, continuing\\nthe line of Perez to David. Many commentators conclude Salmon was one of\\nthe two unnamed spies. If Nahshon were Aaron's age and he fathered Salmon\\nwhen he was 25 or 30, Salmon would be very old when he fathered his son, so\\nadjustments must be made.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe 1446 BC Exodus date affords an ideal point to estimate Salmon's age.\\nTen of the 12 spies returned a bad report shortly after the Exodus. God\\nsentenced Israel to a year in the wilderness for every day the spies\\nsearched Canaan. Those spies were around the age of 40. Apparently, Joshua\\ndecided to send more mature spies in 1406 BC-those around 50 or 55. This\\nwould place Salmon's birth about 1456-1461 BC, ten or fifteen years before\\nthe Exodus. Since he was below military age at that point, he did not die\\nduring the 40 years of wilderness wandering.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAs to Rahab's age when she hid the spies, she had a considerable reputation\\nand an extensive family as well; so she also must have been older, possibly\\neven in her forties, maybe ten years younger than Salmon.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIn summary, about 275 years passed between the birth of Ram, the last\\nperson in the first group, and the birth of Amminadab, the first person in\\nthe second group (1822-1547=275). Ram is the only person available to span\\nthese nearly three centuries. On the basis of four generations per century,\\nten generations are missing between Ram and Amminadab. Next, we will see\\nthat over 300 years passed between the birth of Salmon, the last person in\\nthe second group, and the birth of Boaz, the first person in the third\\ngroup (1462-1153=309). About ten more generations are omitted between these\\ntwo groups.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe third group begins with Boaz. Scripture says Salmon fathered Boaz.\\nSince he was born over 300 years after the birth of Salmon, it is using the\\nterm \\\"fathered\\\" in the broad sense of being the forefather of Boaz. The\\nfinal group in this list contains four generations (Boaz-Obed-Jesse-David).\\nThese are immediate father-son relationships.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe women of the neighborhood gave him [the child of Boaz and Ruth] a name,\\nsaying, 'A son has been born to Naomi.' They named him Obed. He was the\\nfather of Jesse, the father of David. Ruth 4:17.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nDavid was born about 1040 BC. Since he was the youngest of eight sons, his\\nfather would have been born about 1080 BC. The birth of Obed would have\\nbeen c. 25 years earlier, about 1105 BC. Boaz was older when he married\\nRuth, possibly 60, so c. 1165 B.C. would mark his birth. Salmon, the last\\nfather in the previous group, was born about 1461-1456 BC; so, 300 years\\npassed between the births of Salmon and Boaz. Our standard rate for new\\ngenerations suggests twelve generations should have occurred during this\\nperiod. Adjusting for the late start of families can account for several of\\nthese generations, but at least nine are omitted. Added to the eleven\\ngenerations omitted between the first and second group, about 20\\ngenerations are omitted in this list from Perez to David. Each of the ten\\nnames in the list had an important place in Hebrew history. Most likely the\\nother 20 were relatively unknown. This is classic Hebrew genealogy. It\\nappears without alteration in Matthew and Luke.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSince some may suggest that Scripture gives many examples of starting\\ngenerations late, we would be the first to acknowledge such examples.\\nHowever, they are exceptions, not the rule. As soon as the difficulty was\\nremoved, the normal pattern took over. Jacob delayed taking a wife when he\\nsaw the distress of his parents over Esau's two Canaanite wives. He was 81\\nwhen God gave him a wife, and in the next ten years he had twelve children\\n(by four wives). On the other hand Arphachshad, the first named person\\nafter the Flood, and the next six generations each started having sons\\nbetween the ages of twenty-nine and thirty-five. That was normal then.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAbraham's father began his family at the age of 70, but we know the\\nreason-infertility. Infertility was an intermittent problem in Terah's\\nline. His daughter, Sarah, was infertile, having a child by the direct\\nintervention of God at the age of ninety. Rebekah, granddaughter of Terah,\\nwas infertile and had twins by the direct intervention of God when Isaac\\nwas sixty. All of this was abnormal. When Jacob moved his family to Egypt,\\nhis twelve sons were between the ages of 48 and 24. All of them had sons.\\nSome even appear to have had grandsons. Joseph, who died at the age of 110,\\nsaw his descendants to the fourth generation (Genesis 50:23). Starting\\nfamilies between the ages of 18 and early thirties was typical of Hebrew\\nculture after Jacob.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Example 12 Details-The Priesthood of Israel. </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe priesthood upheld the heart of the nation. God called it to a unique\\nand formidable mission. Unique-tasked to teach the nation God's holiness,\\nthe essence and acts of sin and sin's necessary absolution through\\nsacrifice. Formidable-the nation's very relationship with God depended upon\\nkeeping His laws. Underlying that relationship were promises within a\\ncovenant which were repeated and enhanced. Thus, the genealogies of the\\nPriesthood were foundational to the very survival of the nation.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nGod chose this special line when the Hebrews numbered several million and\\nthe adult males among them numbered about eight hundred thousand. From them\\nGod chose just one man, Aaron, and his four sons to become the officials\\nassigned with keeping the nation true to God. His two oldest sons taught,\\nby bad example, that to violate God's instructions for worship could be\\nlethal. They offered strange fire and God slew them. The two remaining\\nsons, Eleazar and Ithamar and their descendants alone would be the nation's\\npriests.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nNumbers 18:7 cites the divine authorization for this hereditary priesthood.\\nTo Aaron God said: \\\"You and your sons with you shall guard your priesthood\\nfor all that concerns the altar and that is within the veil; and you shall\\nserve. I give your priesthood as a gift, and any outsider who comes near\\nshall be put to death.\\\" Encroaching on the priesthood was no small offense.\\nIt triggered a death penalty. The priesthood particularly involved \\\"the\\naltar and what was within the veil.\\\" To assist Aaron in all the work\\nassociated with the exacting demands of the Tabernacle operations, all the\\nrest of the tribe of Levi, some 22,000 males, was a gift to him \\\"to do the\\nservice of the tent of meeting\\\" (Numbers 18:6). In the beginning the\\npriesthood of Israel was indeed selective.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nLevi's three sons-Gershon, Kohath and Merari-gave the tribe its three\\nclans. They camped on three sides of the Tabernacle while Moses and Aaron\\ntented on the entrance side which faced east. Levites of retirement age\\nwere to guard the Tabernacle, forbidding unauthorized access and putting to\\ndeath any who violated its sacredness. Whether they ever executed anyone or\\nnot, their very presence assured a proper respect for the Tabernacle. This\\ninstitution (priest, Tabernacle, sacrifice and Ark) enforced God's rule as\\nHe dwelt at the very center of the nation. He was the very cause and reason\\nfor Israel's existence. To weaken this institution was like making war on\\nGod who uniquely established the nation. Therefore, trifling with the\\nTabernacle would be a most capital offense.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nNumbers 3:4 relates that \\\"Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests in the\\nlifetime of Aaron their father.\\\" Just before Aaron died God told Moses,    <sup>25</sup>\\\"Take Aaron and Eleazar his son and bring them up to Mount\\nHor. <sup>26</sup>And strip Aaron of his garments and put them on Eleazar\\nhis son. <sup>27</sup>And Aaron shall be gathered to his people and shall\\ndie there\\\" (Numbers 20:25-27). While all the descendants of Aaron who met\\nthe qualifications could serve as priests, only one would wear the special\\ngarment of high priest.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nA short time later Israel began whoring with the daughters of Moab (Numbers\\n25:1). God said to hang the chiefs of the people to stop the plague He had\\nsent. Moses ordered the judges to slay the guilty under them. Phinehas,\\ngrandson of Aaron and son of Eleazar, took a spear and plunged it through a\\nprominent Israelite man and noted Moabite woman in the man's bedchamber.\\nGod said the zeal of Phinehas had turned back His anger from consuming the\\nnation even though the plague took 24,000. As a reward God said:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<sup>12</sup>\\nBehold, I give to him [Phinehas] my covenant of peace, <sup>13</sup>and it\\nshall be to him and to his descendants after him the covenant of a\\nperpetual priesthood, because he was jealous for his God and made atonement\\nfor the people of Israel. Numbers 25:12-13.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThis event further refined the official line of high priests in Israel.\\nWhile all of Aaron's descendants qualified genealogically as priests, God\\nappointed Aaron's older surviving son Eleazar to be Aaron's successor; and,\\nthis verse arranged that the position of chief priest would be given to\\nEleazar's son Phinehas and his line. The next chief priests were all direct\\ndescendants of Phinehas.\\n</p>\\n<h4>\\nSwitching from the Line of Eleazar to the Line of Ithamar: Meet the High\\nPriest Eli\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\nThen for some unexplained reason the work of high priest switched from a\\ndescendant of Aaron's older son Eleazar to a descendant of his younger son\\nIthamar. How strange, in view of the covenant given to Phinehas. Since\\nservice at the Tabernacle was essential for the accomplishment of God's\\npurpose with Israel, commentators have surmised that some unusual\\ncircumstance led to the necessity of calling on Ithamar's line, such as the\\nexisting chief priest becoming incapacitated, or the next in line being\\njust an infant, or the demands of being both a chief priest and judge being\\ntoo great for the next priest in line at that time.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWhatever circumstance led to calling on the line of Ithamar, the elders of\\nIsrael must have sought the LORD, and He designated Eli of the line of\\nIthamar. Almost unanimously commentators agree that Eli was the legitimate\\nacting chief priest. However, the official record of I Chronicles six does\\nnot mention him. As far as can be determined it only lists direct\\ndescendants of Eleazar through Phinehas. The equivalent of five generations\\nfrom the line of Eli served as high priest for well over a century. After\\nthat the position reverted to the descendants of Aaron's older son Eleazar.\\nWhile this switch was strange, the overriding principle was that God needed\\nfaithful priests. In His sovereign choice, He raised up the line of Eli who\\nfilled that need for a time. Although his two sons were worthless men,\\nwithout question, his grandson Ahitub, and the following two generations\\nwere godly men and faithful chief priests.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSaul wiped out 84 priests of Eli's descendants wearing the ephod at Nob (I\\nSamuel 22:6-23). One alone, Abiathar, escaped to David and served under him\\nas David continued to elude Saul. Abiathar came with an ephod (I Samuel\\n23:6) which allowed David to inquire of the LORD. Through Abiathar and his\\nephod the LORD gave specific instructions concerning David's efforts to\\navoid being killed by Saul (I Samuel 23:2, 4, 9-12). With all but one of\\nthe priests who descended from Eli dead and that sole surviving priest\\nbeing with the fugitive David, Israel had no functioning priesthood.\\nScripture does not tell how, but descendants of Eleazar again began serving\\nas priests for the rest of the nation. So, for a period, two high priests\\nserved, one with David from the family of Ithamar and one with the nation\\nat Gibeon from the family of Eleazar.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nNear the end of David's life, the priest with David (Abiathar of the\\nIthamar line) supported Adonijah, David's son who was born next after\\nAbsalom and unwisely declared himself as David's successor when David was\\nbedridden. By that time Zadok of the line of Eleazar was backing David.\\nAfter David made Solomon king, Solomon retired Abiathar; but his son\\nJonathan, and later grandson Ahimelech served as head of the eight courses\\nof priests made up from the Ithamar line.\\n</p>\\n<h4>\\nWhy Didn't Samuel Succeed Eli as High Priest?\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\nIf the case of Eli was unusual, the case of Samuel was doubly so. Most\\nBible students know that Eli's sons were wicked, even fornicating with\\nfemale servants at the Tabernacle. Scripture calls them worthless and said\\nthey blasphemed the sacrifices of the LORD. Their debauchery was a national\\nscandal. Samuel's mother, who was barren, saw the need for a faithful\\npriest at Shiloh and vowed that if the LORD gave her a son, she would\\ndedicate him to serve God all his life. Hannah and her husband Elkanah were\\ndescendants of Levi, serving the tribe of Ephraim and thus called\\n\\\"Ephrathites\\\" (I Samuel 1:1). As Levites they were very concerned for the\\nspiritual welfare of Israel. But Elkanah was not a descendant of Aaron so\\nhe was not a priest. God gave Hannah the son she prayed for; and, once he\\nwas weaned she left him with Eli. Her prayer of praise in I Samuel 2\\ncontains images of her expectations that God would triumph over evil\\nthrough righteous servants.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThrough the years Eli found Samuel to be all that his sons were not and\\ntrained Samuel to perform the duties of a priest. Meanwhile God began to\\ngive visions to Samuel so that in time all Israel knew that God spoke\\nthrough him. Then came the day when Eli's sons carried the ark into battle\\nagainst the Philistines who defeated the Israelites, captured the ark and\\nkilled Eli's two sons. When the news reached Eli he fell over backwards and\\ndied of a broken neck. He was 98 years old. His two wicked sons were most\\nlikely in their sixties and his oldest grandchildren could have been over\\n30. One was actually born that day.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWe might expect Samuel, who by this time was about 30, to step into the\\nrole of chief priest but he did not. In fact, he did not call himself a\\npriest and Scripture never calls him a priest. This is amazing since he\\nwore the ephod, the priests' garment, and Scripture says repeatedly that he\\n\\\"ministered unto the LORD under Eli.\\\" How can this be explained? The answer\\nis twofold-first his genealogy but second God's purposes. Samuel was not a\\ndescendant of Aaron. While he was a Levite, he could never be the high\\npriest or even hold the office of priest because he was not a son of Aaron.\\nAs a Levite he could assist Eli in any way Eli asked, but on his own\\nauthority, he could not offer sacrifice at the Tabernacle. He knew his\\ngenealogy and honored God by somehow avoiding the designation of priest. In\\nfact he must have made this clear to his contemporaries because the title\\n\\\"priest\\\" is never given to him in Scripture. This remarkable dedication in\\nitself is an evidence of the inerrancy of Scripture.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBut secondly, a man of God came to Eli even before Samuel's call when he\\nwas still very young. After rehearsing the wickedness of Eli's sons, he\\nsaid, <sup>30</sup>\\\"The God of Israel declares 'I promised that your house\\nand the house of your father should go in and out before me forever,' but\\nnow the LORD declares: 'Far be it from me, for those who honor me I will\\nhonor, and those who despise me shall be lightly esteemed. <sup>31</sup>\\nBehold, the days are coming when I will cut off your strength and the\\nstrength of your father's house, so that there will not be an old man in\\nyour house\\\" (I Samuel 2:31-32). Then comes the principle basic to any\\nblessing from God: \\\"I will raise up for myself a faithful priest, who shall\\ndo according to what is in my heart and in my mind\\\" (I Samuel 2:35).\\nImplicit in enjoying any promised blessing of God is a heart submitted to\\nHis will.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThis explains how Samuel could \\\"minister unto the LORD\\\" yet not officially\\nbe a priest. Above all, God honors and receives the service of faithful\\nservants. But the story is not done. I Chronicles 9:22 gives Samuel credit\\nalong with David for organizing activities at the Tabernacle. Apparently\\nwhen Eli and his sons died on the same day, the fear of the LORD gripped\\nEli's remaining descendants and, if not before, they became very humble and\\nteachable. Samuel began a training program for Eli's grandsons and over the\\nyears both organized and standardized the priestly services at the\\nTabernacle so that Eli's next three generations all served faithfully as\\npriests. Possibly Samuel did this through his office as the last judge of\\nIsrael. Regardless, the intent of his mother's prayer, that righteousness\\nwould prevail, was answered.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWe know Samuel's genealogy because David appointed his grandson, Heman, to\\nbe the chief choirmaster at the Tabernacle. His apparently complete\\ngenealogy beginning with Korah (Table 5.2) is given in the Chronicles\\nchapter (I Chronicles 6) devoted to Levi's descendants. Genealogies were an\\nessential feature to the success of Israel in accomplishing God's purposes\\nwith the nation. Godly Israelites such as Samuel held the genealogies as\\nthe very word and will of God.\\n</p>\\n<h4>\\nOther Characteristics of Israel's High Priests\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\nThe succession of high priests is not a reliable way to measure the passing\\nof time. Whereas generations were measured from the birth of the father to\\nthe birth of his first son, the office of high priest was just the\\nopposite. When the high priest died or became extremely disabled, his son\\nassumed the office. (The same was true for Israel's kings.) So in the case\\nof the chief priest, time would be measured from the death of one to the\\ndeath of the next.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWhile on first glance this seams reliable; in fact, it is not. In the case\\nof Eli, when he died at the age of 98 he was blind (I Samuel 4:15). His\\nsons (and Samuel) had been doing the work of the high priest but neither of\\nthem held the office. Eli's sons actually died before their father died and\\nEli's grandson succeeded Eli as the next chief priest. In the case of\\nIsrael's first high priest, Aaron, it seems that his sons, Eleazar and\\nIthamar, were doing most of the work in Aaron's later years. In the next\\ngeneration Phinehas was very active while his father Eleazar was still\\nalive and held the office.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe practice of naming sons after famous forefathers was commonly practiced\\nby Israel's later high priests. In the list of 23 names of I Chronicles 6,\\nthere are three duplicates (Amariah, Ahitub and Zadak) and one triplicate\\n(Azariah). Eli also followed this practice by naming his second son after\\nAaron's famous grandson Phinehas. His line also first used the name Ahitub\\nwhich the official line would later use twice. The Chronicles list also\\nbegins with Jacob, Levi, Kohath and Amram before naming Aaron, Israel's\\nfirst high priest. That mentioning is an example of condensing because\\nthere are up to twelve unnamed generations between Amram and Aaron.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAs to the completeness of the Chronicles list, Dr. Keil writes: \\\"We find\\ntoo few names for the time from the death of Aaron to the death of Uzzi\\n(Ozi), when Eli became high priest-a period of 299 years [by the\\nKeil/Delitzsche chronology]&#8230;. Five high priests-Eleazar, Phinehas,\\nAbishua, Bukki and Uzzi-are too few; for in that case each one of them must\\nhave discharged the office for 60 years, and have begotten the son who\\nsucceeded him in the office only in his 60<sup>th</sup> year, or the\\ngrandson must have regularly succeeded the grandfather in the office-all of\\nwhich suppositions appear somewhat incredible. Clearly, therefore,\\nintermediate names must have been omitted in our register.\\\"\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nDr. Keil finds the second and third periods (Eli-Solomon and Solomon to the\\nCaptivity) to have about the right number of names, serving an average of\\n25-35 years. He adds that notable names such as Jehoiada and Urijah \\\"who\\nwas certainly high priest (2 Kings 16:10 ff)\\\" are omitted, but that some\\nlike Jehoiada might have been known by another name in the Chronicles list\\nand that Urijah was too unimportant to be included.    <a href=\\\"#_ftn4\\\" name=\\\"_ftnref4\\\" title=\\\"\\\">[4]</a>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nRemarkably, in the days of King Joash, Jehoiada was the only priest\\nmentioned from the time he and his wife hid baby Joash until his death late\\nin Joash's reign. Jehoiada died at the remarkable age of 130 (2 Chronicles\\n24:15). His career was so distinguished that he was buried among the kings\\nof Israel. The period from the birth of Joash until the death of Johoiada\\nlate in the king's career suggests he was about 90 years old when he is\\nfirst mentioned in Scripture. Certainly, his outstanding service to the\\nLORD had gone on for many years before Joash. He was the face of the\\npriesthood for 50-60 years, yet his name is not found in either the I\\nChronicles 6 or Ezra lists. Either his name was dropped from the list by\\nscribal error or he was such an effective priest that even if one or more\\nchief priests in the list ruled during his years of stellar service, they\\nlet him represent them.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWith a few exceptions, the abbreviation of genealogies during the period\\nfollowing David is beyond the scope of this study. This survey of the high\\npriestly line is for the purpose of exploring the possibility of omitted\\nchief priests while guiding readers away from unfounded interpretations. On\\nthe other hand, Table 6.14 shows a definite gap in the line of Ezra the\\npriest when placed side by side with the Chronicles list of high priests.\\nThe observations of Dr. Keil together with our comments on Jehoiada seem to\\nestablish a reasonable possibility that even the line of high priests\\nfollowed the principle of selectivity in the records when it could. On the\\nbasis of 30 year tenures we have entered five successive omissions in the\\nfirst period as well as several individuals during the second period. But,\\nmost importantly, the high priestly office was a matter of heredity; so,\\nwhere the correct name was essential there would be no condensing.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Example 13 Details-Ezra the Priest. </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<sup>1</sup>\\nNow after this in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Ezra the son of\\nSeraiah, the son of Azariah, son of Hilkiah, <sup>2</sup>son of Shallum,\\nson of Zadok, son of Ahitub, <sup>3</sup>son of Amariah, son of Azariah, [I\\nChronicles 6:9-7 adds \\\"Johanah, Azariah, Ahimaaz, Zadok, Ahitub and\\nAmariah\\\"], son of Meraioth, <sup>4</sup>son of Zerahiah, son of Uzzi, son\\nof Bukki, <sup>5</sup>son of Abishua, son of Phinehas, son of Eleazar, son\\nof Aaron the chief priest&#8230;. Ezra 7:1-5.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSpanning from Aaron to the post-Exile period, Ezra's genealogy, like\\nDavid's, is clearly abbreviated. It omits six consecutive chief priests\\nthat are found in the primary record of Aaron's line (I Chronicles 6:1-15).\\nThe omission occurred around the transition from the Judges to the\\nmonarchy. Many think Ezra compiled I Chronicles. Whether or not he did the\\nfact that he is closely identified with I Chronicles shows he was very\\nfamiliar with that record so his omission was clearly intentional.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIn Ezra 7:1-5 Ezra listed his descent all the way back to Aaron, Israel's\\nfirst chief priest. He began, \\\"Ezra the son of Seraiah\\\" and used the same\\nphrase \\\"the son of\\\" or \\\"son of\\\" with each head priest until he reached\\nAaron. From Seraiah to Aaron he listed 16 forefathers. One has no clue that\\nhis genealogy is condensed except that in I Chronicles 6:1-15 the same list\\nis given in the opposite order and contains 22 names from Aaron to Seraiah.\\nThe six names Ezra omits are not an occasional omission here and there,\\nwhich might then be the result of scribal error, but are the six\\nconsecutive high priests that are named between Azariah and Meraioth. The\\nsix omitted priests working back from Azariah are 1-Johannan, 2-Azariah, 3-\\nAhimaaz, 4-Zadok, 5-Ahitub and 6-Amariah. After passing over those six\\nconsecutive high priests, Ezra continued with \\\"son of Meraioth, son of\\nZerahiah\\\" etc. (See both lists side by side in Table 6.13.)\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nViewing the list of high priests found in I Chronicles 6:1-15 in descending\\norder (beginning with Aaron), the six missing priests are the 9    <sup>th</sup> through the 14<sup>th</sup>\\n(Amariah-Ahitub-Zadok-Ahimaaz-Azariah-Johanan). Ezra may have abbreviated\\nthe list of 22 into 16 for sake of brevity, but then again, there may have\\nbeen a deeper reason for omitting the six names.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIf Ezra were uncertain about who was really the chief priest during that\\ntime of two chief priests, perhaps he bypassed the problem by condensing\\nhis genealogy to avoid stating chief priests who functioned as chief\\npriests but did not officially hold the office of chief priest. Then when\\nthe list in Chronicles was put together, the author(s) decided on recording\\na clear line from Eleazar. While this explanation is tentative and does not\\nexplain why those omitted extended beyond the end of Eli's line, whatever\\nwas the reason for omitting six consecutive priests, it is clear that Ezra\\ndid omit them and that this instance adds to the many examples showing that\\nabbreviating lists was acceptable in Hebrew thinking.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nEzra also omitted the generations between Seraiah and him. Nebuchadnezzar\\nslew his elderly forefather Seraiah. Seraiah's successor, Jehozadak, was\\nthe high priest during the captivity and presumably Seraiah's oldest son.\\nJehozadak was followed by his son Jeshua who was the first high priest when\\nCyrus the Great decreed that captives could return to their land. Then,\\nScripture names six succeeding high priests. Possibly Ezra does not name\\nthem because he was a descendant of one of the other sons of Seraiah. All\\nhe needed to do was show that he descended from Aaron which qualified him\\nas a priest so he omits the obscure names between Seraiah and himself.\\nTable 13 shows Ezra's list side by side with Aaron's.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Examples 14-16 Details-The Temple Singers. </strong>\\nKing David appointed a descendant from each Levite clan to lead\\nworship-Heman from the clan of Kohath (but not a son of Amram-I Chronicles\\n6:33 with 6:38), Asaph from the clan of Gershom (I Chronicles 6:39, 43) and\\nEthan from the clan of Merari (I Chronicles 6:44). None of these men were\\ndescendants of Aaron so none qualified for the office of priest. But all\\nthe descendants of Levi were given to Aaron to assist him in leading Israel\\nin worship and all three were Levites. Samuel's grandson Heman, the chief\\nchoirmaster, descended from Izhar through Korah the rebel (Tables 5.1 and\\n6.14).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nNineteen generations are found beginning with Korah and ending with Heman.\\nIn the same time period the line of Aaron, contemporary with Korah, names\\nbut eleven. We suggest about 26 years per generation in Heman's line, but\\n30 years per generation in Aaron's line and include nine omissions to make\\nthe dates work for Aaron. Heman had 14 sons in his choir (maybe sons and\\ngrandsons) so he was most likely older than David. Like Aaron's line\\nAsaph's line is also condensed. It has twelve names, skipping about seven.\\nEthan's line is even more condensed, containing just ten, thus skipping\\nabout nine generations.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThese three lines span the very important years of Israel's early history,\\nabout 500 years from Aaron to David. To picture the distribution of these\\ngenerations Table 6.11b shows them side by side with David and Table 6.15a\\nshows them side by side with Aaron.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    Final example of abbreviated genealogies, example 16 Details-Heman\\n</strong>\\n. David appointed this grandson of Samuel to the position of chief\\nTabernacle choir master. His list is recorded in the chapter on Levite\\ngenealogies, I Chronicles 6. It begins with him in verse 33 and goes all\\nthe way back to the Patriarch Israel in verse 39. In a way it follows the\\npattern of the first seven examples, giving tribe, clan, household and\\nindividual, adding only the name Israel. The individual following an\\napproximately 12 generation gap is Korah (Table 6.02). But from Korah to\\nHeman are 19 names. That calculates to 26+ year generations so that part of\\nthe list is most likely complete.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe remarkable genealogy of Samuel (Table 6.17) concludes this series of\\nlists. Words fail to describe the ministry of this godly man in the\\nspiritual life of Israel. Following his genealogy is a supporting\\nchronology (Table 6.17a) while Table 17b places his list side by side with\\nthat of Aaron and Eli. Because of so many ties with other lists, his list\\nis a delightful conclusion to this very detailed chapter on lists. While\\nmany of the date assignments are estimates, they must be close to the true\\ndates because of so many complementary lists.\\n</p>\\n<h4>\\n<a name=\\\"_Hlk92533240\\\">Summary on Condensed Genealogies</a>\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\nThis chapter has presented a case for the condensing of numerous\\ngenealogies-those of Aaron, Korah, Dathan, Abiram, On, Achan, the daughters\\nof Zelophehad, Sheerah, Joshua, Caleb the spy, David, the priesthood of\\nIsrael, Ezra, two Temple singers and Heman. Among the most obvious are\\nAaron (Table 6.01), Ezra (Table 6.14) and David (Table 6.11). The case of\\nEzra is both straight forward and simple because when comparing his list\\nwith the official list in Chronicles, he omits six consecutive names. Since\\nit is understood that Ezra the Scribe was heavily involved in editing books\\nof the Old Testament and he wrote the book of Ezra, he was at the least\\nvery familiar with I Chronicles. This seems to be another iron-clad example\\nof an abbreviated genealogy.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe case of Aaron is the iron-clad example we used to unlock this subject\\nin chapter one; however, it requires far more detail to establish than the\\nblock of omissions in Ezra's line. But numerous other examples have been\\npresented. While a few may legitimately be dismissed through alternative\\ninterpretations, most will remain. Consequently, those of faith have two\\nduties-both to receive the text of Scripture as the very word of God and to\\nunderstand it in the light of how words were used when the text was\\nwritten. The great encouragement section of Isaiah begins with a reminder\\nthat while all flesh is grass, \\\"the word of our God will stand forever\\\"\\n(Isaiah 40:6, 8). Our poor minds must defer to that which stands throughout\\neternity.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWhile recognizing that the above abbreviated genealogies, at most, make\\nonly a difference of 215-years in the date of creation, they do establish a\\nprecedent for Hebrew genealogies commonly being condensed. If the\\ngenealogies of Genesis 5 and/or 11 bear evidence of condensing, they could\\nchange the date of the Flood by much more than 215-years. They will be\\nlooked at in the next chapter.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Confirmation of the biblical use of genealogies</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIn the summer of 2021, I stumbled across an article on the Internet that\\ncontained the same information I had discovered from Scripture over the\\npreceding decade and have written in this chapter and the last. The article\\nWAs entitled \\\"The Genesis Genealogies\\\" and first appeared in the 1/1/2001\\nnewsletter of <em>Reasons to Believe</em>. It was comprehensive,\\nwell-organized and the writer, Dr. John M. Millam, was a chemist in his\\nmid-thirties. Thus, two individuals of totally different backgrounds but\\nthe same love for Jesus Christ and belief in the inerrancy of Scripture\\nconclude that Scripture uses family terms in the broad sense as well as the\\nimmediate sense and that it often abbreviates OT genealogies. The agreement\\nof such diverse researchers surely argues for the soundness of this view.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<a name=\\\"_Hlk92644064\\\">In 2011 Dr. Millam </a>\\nupdated his article. Now as a 38-page pdf file, it answers to an Internet\\nsearch for \\\"The Genesis Genealogies.\\\" In personal correspondence he told me\\nthe biblical history bug bit him and it has become his passion. Over the\\nlast 20 years he has written about 19 articles for the bimonthly\\nnewsletter. He is especially precise in showing how many of those who argue\\nfor the young earth position are inexact in their research. We agree with\\nhim on this point and seek to approach Scripture with all the integrity we\\ncan muster. In chapter eight we will answer his position on the extent of\\nthe Flood and duration of the days of creation but these different views\\nmust not divide the body of Christ.\\n</p>\\n<h4>\\nSecular History of the Ancient Near East Confirm Biblical Records\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\nChapters 1-6 of <em>HB</em> discuss the biblical records from Abraham to\\nMoses. By giving many numbers including the years of the Patriarchs and the\\nlife of Moses, Bible students can date the birth of Abraham to 2166 BC, the\\nbeginning of the sojourn in Egypt to 1876 BC and the Exodus to 1446 BC.\\nThese dates fit well with secular history, thus adding confirmation to the\\nvalidity of Scripture. Abraham left Ur and entered Canaan at exactly the\\nonly time when Southern Persia briefly dominated Mesopotamia until 1500\\nyears later. During this stretch of history Moses lived precisely when\\nEgyptian history could allow it even though all traces of Israel's time in\\nEgypt have been erased.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe Pharaoh of Joseph's day gave Jacob's family choice land in the Nile\\nDelta. Later, Hyksos invaders overcame weak pharaohs and gained control of\\nparts of Lower Egypt. This allowed the Hebrews considerable freedom since\\nboth peoples were semitic. Some Egyptologist go so far as to say that the\\nHebrews were allies of the Hyksos. Scripture doesn't speak of the Hyksos\\nbut does report that Jacob's descendants multiplied until \\\"the land was\\nfilled with them\\\" (Exodus 1:7). Verse eleven reports that a pharaoh set\\ntask masters over them to afflict them \\\"lest they join our\\nenemies&#8230;and escape from the land\\\".\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nEven slavery did not stop Hebrew population growth. So a new policy was\\nissued: the Hebrew midwives were instructed to kill Hebrew boy babies. When\\nthat didn't work Pharaoh gave the order to cast Hebrew boy babies into the\\nNile River. Moses was born at this time. His mother hid him as long as she\\ncould (three months; Exodus 2:2), then cleverly prepared a floating basket,\\nput her baby inside and placed the basket where Pharaoh's daughter bathed\\neach day. Pharaoh's daughter spotted the basket, looked inside and saw a\\nbaby boy crying. Scripture says she took pity on him even though she\\nrecognized immediately that the baby was a Hebrew.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe baby's sister had been stationed to watch. She offered to get a Hebrew\\nnurse. Pharaoh's daughter agreed, the baby's mother came and Pharaoh's\\ndaughter said \\\"Take this child away and nurse him for me, and I will give\\nyou your wages\\\" (Exodus 2:9). When the child grew older, his mother brought\\nhim to Pharaoh's daughter. Because of this remarkable window of\\nopportunity, one can only imagine how intensely his family worked to\\nprepare him to live as one of their own in Pharaoh's palace. Also of\\nimportance, Thutmose I would have had to give his daughter permission to\\nadopt a Hebrew as her own son so he had reasons for giving this permission\\nand they are open to no end of speculation.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAs to Egyptian history, Amenhotep I was the first pharaoh of the 18    <sup>th</sup> Dynasty and is credited with driving out the Hyksos so he\\nwould have been the pharaoh who enslaved the Hebrews. The next Pharaoh,\\nThutmose I, followed the policies of his predecessor, oppressing the\\nHebrews. He also expanded the empire into Nubia and penetrated deep into\\nSyria. He fathered a daughter named Hatshepsut by his royal wife and later\\na son, Thutmose II, by a secondary wife. Thutmose II married his older\\nhalf-sister and they had one child, a daughter named Neferure. Thutmose II\\nalso fathered a son, Thutmose III, by a lesser wife. Then he died, leaving\\nEgypt with a two-year-old pharaoh.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nHistorians use an astronomical event to date the years of Thutmose III. But\\nit has a major problem. Where it was observed was unrecorded, so it varies\\nby 20 years depending on whether it was observed from the Delta or up the\\nNile at Thebes. Instead of Thutmose III ruling Egypt through an appointed\\nstand in, Hatshepsut, his aunt, governed the country on her own. Thutmose\\nIII did not take the reins of power until Hatshepsut died 20 years later.\\nHistory has concluded he hated her and, in his resentment, did all in his\\npower to erase her name once he was in charge. In the last few years\\nEgyptologist have changed this view. They have enough reasons to write a\\nbook but we only have a page to pass on their thinking.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAmenhotep II, the Pharaoh of the Exodus, not his father Thutmose III, was\\nthe Pharaoh who took credit for some of Hatshepsut's accomplishments. It is\\nspeculated that he did this to strengthen his claim to the throne. This\\nindicates that he was a weak pharaoh. He was the Pharaoh of the Exodus.\\nThutmose III actually built his tomb adjacent to that of Hatshepsut who\\nruled for him until he was 22. Most likely, she did all she could to\\nprepare him for a successful life as Pharaoh when he was ready. He\\ncertainly moved forward, building on her prosperous reign, not complaining\\nabout the past once he was in charge.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nHistory regards Thutmose II as an insignificant pharaoh. Only a small\\nnumber of documents exist for his reign. Relief scenes during his reign\\ndepict both him with his wife and his wife alone. Only one major monument\\nis credited to Thutmose II and that one was completed by his son. Unique\\nscarab seals were used by each Pharaoh on official documents and other\\nimportant works. Because they were extremely small, they were hard to\\nalter. The number for each Pharaoh is considered indicative of that\\nPharaoh's importance. Archaeologists have found 241 for Thutmose I, 65 for\\nThutmose II and 463 for Hatshepsut.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nHatshepsut was a prolific builder, commissioning hundreds of construction\\nprojects including the Twin Obelisks, the tallest in the world at the time.\\nShe employed the world-famous architect, Ineni. She produced prodigious\\namounts of statuary. She worked on increasing trade and generally conducted\\na peaceful rule. Egypt became prosperous under her hand. Whether it was a\\nbaby boy or a nation, her instinct was to nurture, to give the best care\\npossible.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nFor years scholars debated whether she regarded herself as Pharaoh. Now\\nthey are certain she did, making her the 2<sup>nd</sup> confirmed female\\npharaoh in Egyptian history. In fact, she claimed her father intended that\\nshe should succeed him. It is thought that she even acted as her father's\\nregent in his final years, was the power behind her husband's entire rule\\nas well as those first 20 years of Thutmose III's rule. These years are\\ncharacterized by consistent domestic and foreign policies. When she did\\ndie, due to the prosperity she left, Thutmose III could begin the first of\\n16 military campaigns that over 20 years would extend Egypt's power all the\\nway to the Euphrates. He is considered a military genius and was one of the\\nmost militaristic of all the Pharaohs. One historian called him the\\nNapoleon of Egypt.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWhere is Moses in all this? Moses wrote in Exodus 2:10 that when the Hebrew\\nnurse brought the child to \\\"Pharaoh's daughter&#8230;he became her son. She\\nnamed him Moses, 'Because,' she said, 'I drew him out of the water.'\\\" Thus,\\nMoses himself claimed that he was both named and adopted by Pharaoh's\\ndaughter. Stephen agrees, saying \\\"Pharaoh's daughter adopted him and\\nbrought him up as her own son\\\" (Acts 7:21). Then Stephen adds, \\\"And Moses\\nwas instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and he was mighty in his\\nwords and deeds\\\" (Acts 7:22).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nMoses had the best education available in one of the greatest dynasties\\never to rule Egypt. His mind was filled with construction and statuary. He\\nwas trained as a military leader by a nation skilled in warfare. For most\\nof 40 years he had seen his royal mother, Pharaoh Hatshepsut care for\\nEgypt. He could appreciate freedom within limits, knowing that his people\\nlived their own lives in a sense while also being used positively for\\nEgypt's construction projects. But he had no idea how miserable they were,\\nhow mistreated they were. Then, for some unexplained reason, he visited his\\npeople when he was not expected and saw an Egyptian taskmaster unmercifully\\nmistreating a Hebrew slave. In a fit of anger, he struck down the Egyptian\\nand buried his body in the sand. When Pharaoh learned of this, he sought to\\nkill Moses (Exodus 2:15). Moses fled.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe experiences in Egypt were essential elements in preparing him for\\nleadership during the 40-years Israel was in the wilderness and God was\\nunfolding an earth-shaking plan for the Hebrew people. But he would need\\nother training as well. The next 40 years were spent in the family of a\\ntrue servant of the living God coping with the harsh climate of the\\nwilderness and caring for sheep. Until Moses completed this new education,\\nhe would not be ready to shepherd God's flock.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAs to specific dates, Moses was born in 1526 BC. Most likely Pharaoh's\\ndaughter was younger rather than older at this time, maybe 15 years old.\\nPossibly ten or fifteen years later she married her half-brother. Moses was\\n40 in 1486 BC when he slew the Egyptian and fled for his life from Pharaoh\\nThutmose III who was in his twenties. It is noteworthy that Moses\\nsuccessfully fled and covered the distance to Midian, apparently all on his\\nown.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nEgyptologists maintain a range of dates for the 18<sup>th</sup> Dynasty.\\nThey call the more recent dates the Low Chronology while the older dates\\nare called the High Chronology. The biblical dates fall somewhere in the\\nmiddle. Regarding the dates, Wikipedia includes an interesting caution:\\n\\\"These dates, just as all of the dates of the Eighteenth Dynasty, are open\\nto dispute&#8230;\\\"<a href=\\\"#_ftn5\\\" name=\\\"_ftnref5\\\" title=\\\"\\\">[5]</a>\\n</p>\\n<br clear=\\\"all\\\"/>\\n<div>\\n<br clear=\\\"all\\\"/>\\n<hr width=\\\"33%\\\" size=\\\"1\\\" align=\\\"left\\\"/>\\n<div id=\\\"ftn1\\\">\\n    <p>\\n        <a href=\\\"#_ftnref1\\\" name=\\\"_ftn1\\\" title=\\\"\\\">\\n            <sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup>\\n        </a>\\n        Unger, <em>Dictionary</em>, 110.\\n    </p>\\n</div>\\n<div id=\\\"ftn2\\\">\\n    <p>\\n        <a href=\\\"#_ftnref2\\\" name=\\\"_ftn2\\\" title=\\\"\\\">\\n            <sup><sup>[2]</sup></sup>\\n        </a>\\n        Keil, <em>Chronicles</em>, 141.\\n    </p>\\n</div>\\n<div id=\\\"ftn3\\\">\\n    <p>\\n        <a href=\\\"#_ftnref3\\\" name=\\\"_ftn3\\\" title=\\\"\\\">\\n            <sup><sup>[3]</sup></sup>\\n        </a>\\n        Keil, <em>Chronicles</em>, 142.\\n    </p>\\n</div>\\n<div id=\\\"ftn4\\\">\\n    <p>\\n        <a href=\\\"#_ftnref4\\\" name=\\\"_ftn4\\\" title=\\\"\\\">\\n            <sup><sup>[4]</sup></sup>\\n        </a>\\n        Keil, <em>Chronicles</em>, 115-116.\\n    </p>\\n</div>\\n<div id=\\\"ftn5\\\">\\n    <p>\\n        <a href=\\\"#_ftnref5\\\" name=\\\"_ftn5\\\" title=\\\"\\\">[5]</a>\\n        En.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thutmose III.\\n    </p>\\n</div>\\n</div>\\n\\n\"},qe={html:\"<p align=\\\"center\\\">\\n<strong>PART III - THE ABBREVIATION OF SHEM'S GENEALOGY</strong>\\n</p>\\n<h1>\\nChapter Seven\\n</h1>\\n<p align=\\\"center\\\">\\n<strong>Shem's List: The Ultimate Example of Condensing</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThis chapter will show beyond reasonable doubt that Shem's genealogy listed\\nin Genesis 11:10-26 consisted of about 45-65 generations, but was condensed\\nto ten by Moses the biblical author. Thus, it is not a chronology. This\\nobservation places the Flood 1300-1900 years earlier than Ussher's date.\\nYet enormous obstacles hide this fact. For instance, unrecognized are two\\nunmistakable kinds of change to human longevity following the Flood-the\\nimmediate and gradual declines of lifespans. These distinct kinds of\\nlongevity decline are further obscured by confusing those born before the\\nFlood with those born after it. Maybe worst of all are the larger age\\nnumbers in the Septuagint which will take the entire next chapter to\\naddress.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSimple words, easy to understand, present ten fathers from Shem to Abraham\\nin Shem's Genesis 11 genealogy. After explaining that two years after the\\nFlood Shem was 100 years old when he fathered Arpachshad, the passage\\ncontinues the following pattern through Nahor without deviation:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<sup>12</sup>\\nWhen Arpachshad had lived 35 years, he fathered Shelah. <sup>13</sup>And\\nArpachshad lived after he fathered Shelah 403 years and had other sons and\\ndaughters. <sup>14</sup>When Shelah had lived 30 years, he fathered Eber.    <sup>15</sup>And Shelah lived after he fathered Eber 403 years and had\\nother sons and daughters. Genesis 11:12-15.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe biblical doctrine of inerrancy requires that all Scripture be taken\\nliterally according to its literary type. The literary type here is simple\\nhistorical narrative. Thus, we must understand that Arpachshad was a real\\nperson, that at the age of 35 he fathered a son and that his remaining\\nyears were 403. Exact numbers are given for the names that follow as\\nwell-the father's age when he fathered his son and the number of years he\\nlived afterwards. These numbers are not fiction. They are facts and each\\nfact is true. However, the verb \\\"to father, to beget\\\" can be understood\\nnarrowly meaning immediate son or broadly meaning someone down the line.\\nLiterally, Shelah can be Arpachshad's immediate offspring or a descendant.\\nThe same is true for any of the other sons in the list. If \\\"to father\\\" is\\nused anywhere in this list for a descendant down the line rather than an\\nimmediate son, adding the age when he fathered his son to the other numbers\\nwould give an incorrect date for the Flood.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nScripture gives no reason to suspect that a substantial gap exists between\\nany of these people except between Eber and Peleg. But before getting into\\nthe subject we must strongly affirm that God intended that all down through\\nhistory after the writing of Genesis, whenever someone would read the\\ncreation account, whether in the time of David, Jesus or Luther, he would\\nsense that he was not far from when God created the heavens and the earth\\nand thus not far from God Himself. In the light of eternity past, creation\\nwas just yesterday. The genealogies of Genesis five and eleven do not allow\\na sense of viewing God as acting so far in the past as to be irrelevant or\\nmerely a foggy memory. These two genealogies, rather, show God to be\\nalmighty and loving and that He is unfolding a plan to share Himself with\\nwhoever wants that relationship for all eternity. Any other reading of\\nthese genealogies misses their intent.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nTo place this chapter in context, here is the thread of our argument so\\nfar. Chapter one demonstrated that the Levi-Aaron genealogy is abbreviated\\nunless Israel sojourned in Egypt just 215-years. Chapters two through four\\nassemble conclusive evidence that Israel sojourned 430-years in Egypt.\\nTherefore, the Levi-Aaron record is condensed. Chapter five discussed the\\nconvenient flexibility of Hebrew relational terms such as father and son.\\nChapter five concluded by recognizing the purpose of Hebrew genealogies:\\nthey connect people with their descendants and ancestors, but generally see\\nno need for comprehensive lists of names as the secular world does. Chapter\\nsix gave sixteen examples of lineages that are abbreviated.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWith this frame of reference, we can now look at the most obviously\\nabbreviated genealogy of all, the line of Shem. The evidence is\\noverwhelming, but is like the proverbial elephant in the room that nobody\\nseems to notice. Poorly reasoned arguments explain this gap away. Some even\\nelevate the idea that Shem's line is complete to the level of a doctrinal\\nstatement and make it a test of doctrinal correctness. Nevertheless, the\\nfacts point to Shem's line being shrunk by about four-fifths.\\n</p>\\n<p align=\\\"center\\\">\\n<strong>Unpacking the Confusion Surrounding Shem's List</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe recorded decline of 225 years in life spans between Eber and Peleg is a\\nclear sign that Shem's line is abbreviated. Since Hebrew genealogies (apart\\nfrom certain lists of kings and priests) are about identifying ancestors\\nwith their descendants and visa-versa, not proving succession, Moses gave\\nonly ten critical names spanning the time from the Flood to Abraham: the\\nPatriarch Shem, the first three generations born immediately after the\\nFlood, the three names following the large gap of omitted names and the\\nthree names involving Abraham-his grandfather, his father and him. This\\nefficiency saved Moses the trouble of recording the omitted 35-55 names.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBy observing the recorded decline per generation just before and after the\\nEber-Peleg entry, the approximate number of missing generations can be\\nestimated. While this approach is simple and straight-forward, much\\ndisinformation must be identified and answered. Before this chapter ends,\\nwe will also address unusual cases of shorter and longer lives as well as\\nthose of Noah and Shem who lived both before and after the Flood.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Recognizing Two Enormous Changes in Human Longevity</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe first three generations born after the Flood-Arpachshad, Shelah and\\nEber-all lived about the same number of years (438, 433 and 464). This is\\nremarkable in that all eight individuals who lived and died before the\\nFlood each lived twice that long, about 900 years (Adam-930; Seth-912;\\nEnosh-905; Kenan-910; Mahalalel-895; Jared-962; Methuselah-969; Lamech-777.\\nGenesis 5:3-31). Then, immediately after the Flood human longevity changed\\ndrastically. It was reduced by half. This is a colossal change, from 900 to\\n450 years.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBut the record gets even more remarkable because after three generations of\\nliving to the age of 450, man's years appear to decrease by half a second\\ntime. Eber lived 464 years while his son Peleg lived 239 years. Peleg's\\nson, also lived 239 years while the sixth name, Peleg's grandson, lived 230\\nyears. The first decrease in lifespans happened immediately after the\\ngreatest disaster ever to strike the earth since Creation, the Global Flood\\nof Noah's day. But Scripture records no event whatsoever associated with\\nthis second halving. And this second halving is clear; it is not stated in\\nobscure language; all can read it. The three named generations following\\nEber (Peleg-Reu-Serug) lived 239, 239 and 230 years. So, are these two\\nhalvings of longevity truly the biblical record? Yes, the Adam group lived\\n930, 912, 905, 910, 895, 962, 969, and 777 years while the Arpachshad group\\nlived just half of that-438, 433 and 464 years-and the Peleg group lived\\njust 1/4<sup>th</sup> of the pre-Flood group-239, 239, 230 years.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nHow could there be such consistency in the midst of such change (900 to 450\\nto 236)? What could possibly have happened to cause such drastic and\\nimmediate changes in the midst of such similar lifespans? This certainly is\\nthe greatest question in the entire history of human longevity. Such a\\ngreat mystery demands a solution. No end of explanations has been offered.\\nThe most common is that the numbers are wrong. Such an answer, however,\\nraises the issue of the integrity of Scripture and is both unacceptable and\\nunnecessary. A variation of this is that the numbers in the Masoretic Text\\nare wrong. One must consult the Septuagint for the correct numbers. Yet\\neven the LXX shows a 33% drop between them. The entire next chapter will be\\ndevoted to discussing the LXX numbers but in this chapter, we are using the\\nMasoretic Text numbers.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSo, two sudden drops in human longevity actually happened. Imagine seeing\\nno problem with eight fathers living to the age of 900, the first three\\nborn after the Flood living only half that long and the next three living\\nonly one-quarter that long when there was no second event to rival the\\nviolence of the Flood. The nature and function of Hebrew genealogies in the\\ncontext of the violence of the Flood supplies the answer.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Immediate and Long-Term Changes to Human Longevity</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIn order to solve the mystery of two halvings of human longevity in such a\\nbrief period one must understand that human longevity changed in two ways\\ndue to the Flood. First, it was immediately reset to half of what it was\\nfor those who lived and died before the Flood. In terms of numbers this\\nreset was from 900 to 450 years. This was an immediate and drastic change\\nin human longevity. The second change was gradual. Human longevity began to\\ndecrease after the Flood from generation to generation. It continued to\\ndecrease for over two millennia. By way of contrast, no such continual\\ndecrease is found before the Flood. This longevity reset was a new\\nphenomenon that began with the Flood.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWhat was the cause of these two changes and more specifically, how did this\\nauthor come to recognize them? As I listened to Creation scientists\\nbeginning in about 1996, I became more and more aware of the severity of\\nthe Flood. At some point this question surfaced: \\\"What did such violence do\\nto those on the Ark; do I find any hint in Scripture.\\\" Eventually I\\nrealized I must look at longevity charts in terms of those who lived and\\ndied before the Flood versus those born after. Noah and Shem had to be\\nseparated out. They were in a category by themselves. This was a new\\napproach to charting longevity. It showed that two kinds of changes to\\nhuman longevity followed the Flood.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe immediate change to human longevity is clear. At the time of the Flood,\\nhuman longevity was reset to half that before the Flood. The genes of those\\nwho boarded the Ark could produce offspring to live 900 years. But when\\nthey got off the ark a year later, their genes could only produce offspring\\nto live 450 years, not 900. And those are the genes they gave to their\\noffspring, 450-year genes, not 900-year genes.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWe repeat: to recognize this change in the genes of mankind, one must\\ncompare those who lived and died before the Flood with those born after it.\\nEleven generations in the line leading to Christ began before the Flood.\\nEnoch was translated directly to heaven so he did not see death. The 10    <sup>th</sup> and 11<sup>th</sup>, Noah and Shem lived both before and\\nafter the Flood so they must be treated separately. The remaining eight all\\ndied before the Flood and lived about the same number of years-900 years.\\nSince they died before the Flood, their reproductive genes could not have\\nbeen affected by the Flood. For them, whatever the Flood did to those on\\nthe Ark had no impact on their genetic makeup so they gave their offspring\\ngenes to live 900 years.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe very first generation born after the Flood lived only half as long. The\\nsame was true for the second and third generations that followed. They also\\nlived only half as long as the pre-Flood individuals. There were no\\nchildren on the Ark, only eight adults-Noah and his wife, their three sons\\nand their sons' wives. Before the Flood the people who lived to 900 reached\\nadulthood at about the age of 100, so that is when they started their\\nfamilies. Noah's three sons were all under the age of 100 although each had\\ntaken a wife. Each of Noah's sons began his recorded family after the\\nFlood. Of Noah's three sons Scripture only gives the years for the line of\\none, Shem, but the Table of Nations (Genesis 10) indicates a similar and\\neven parallel pattern of reproduction in the lines of his two brothers.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nShem begat Arpachshad, his first named son, two years after the Flood.\\nArpachshad lived 438 years. He begat Shelah who lived 433 years. Shelah\\nfathered Eber who lived 464 years. In short, before the Flood people lived\\nabout 900 years; those born right after the Flood, about 450 years. For\\nsome reason not explained by Scripture man's new lifespan after the Flood\\nwas just half of what it was before. The Giver of Life no longer enabled\\nanyone born after the Flood to live to the age of 900. Further, it wasn't\\njust the first generation born after the Flood that lived only half as\\nlong. It was the first three consecutive generations. The first three\\ngenerations in a row born after the Flood lived only half as long as the\\nentire biblical history of those who lived and died before the Flood. This\\ncutting of lifespans in half happened at the very time of the Flood.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBut the Flood marked a second way that human longevity changed. This second\\nchange was an on-going change to human lifespans. It was primarily\\nphysical, something about genetic entrophy, but environmental as well, such\\nas the seasons being more harsh, etc. The causes for this second kind of\\nchange remain to be explored, but their effect is clear. These changes,\\nwhatever they were, slowly drained away much of man's vitality. This second\\nimpact could have taken some time to get started, but it continued to the\\nend of Moses' days. It resulted in a gradual decline of longevity. It is\\nreflected in many verses of Scripture which establish an undeniable\\npattern. The longest recorded lifespan of any born after the Flood was Eber\\nwho was a third generation post-Flood individual. He lived 464 years. Yet\\nnear the end of Moses' life (about 1410 BC), a man's typical full lifespan\\nwas 70 years (Psalm 90:10). While that decline from Eber (464 years) to\\nMoses (70 years) was a huge decline, 369 years, it was nevertheless\\ngradual, happening over the better part of three millennia.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nNow we can see why there is such a drastic difference in the lifespans of\\nEber and Peleg. Their lifespans are simply the typical lifespans of those\\nwho lived before and after an omission of 35-55 consecutive generations.\\nWhile Eber truly lived 464 years, his descendants may have lived more or\\nfewer than 464 years but slowly their lifespans decreased so that 35-55\\ngenerations later people were only living to the age of 239. So, on one\\nside of this enormous omission of generations Eber truly lived 464 years\\nwhile on the other side of this huge gap Peleg truly lived 239 years. In\\nreality, it was not a halving at all, but it can be mistaken for a halving.\\nBy recording the lifespan of Eber (464 years) immediately followed by the\\nlifespan of Peleg (239), Moses was telling his audience that he was\\nskipping the names of 35-55 generations worth of decline. Peleg was not\\nEber's immediate son. He was the son born in that line following all those\\nmissing names. Eber truly lived 464 years and Peleg truly lived 239 years.\\nBut that 225 year decline between them was spread over 35-55 omitted\\ngenerations.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    Understanding the Immediate and Long-Term Impacts of the Flood\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe immediate and long-term impacts of the Flood are not difficult\\nconcepts. But they are new, even radical. As I reviewed the thinking of\\ninerrancy folks on the numbers in Shem's list, I found three general\\npositions. For instance, after reading my Executive Summary a woman at\\nchurch said her high school/college age kids accepted the biblical numbers\\nas accurate, but were uncertain how to understand them--were they\\ngeneralizations or precise; were they complete or not? Her young people\\nprobably represent the average inerrancy believer who does not understand\\nthat sometimes Hebrew genealogies intentionally omit generations.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAt the opposite end of the scale Hebrew scholar Dr. Merrill F. Unger, a\\nchampion of inerrancy, did not hesitate to write clearly and adamantly that\\nShem's list omits names although he did not suggest where or how many. In\\nbetween these poles is the word I received from Dr. William Barrick,\\nreligion editor for Creation Research Journal. He said that he does not\\nhear the 2348 or 4004 BC dates in the creation meetings he attends in the\\nLos Angeles area but on the other hand those speakers don't give earlier\\ndates either. They simply avoid talking about the subject.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSo, the general thinking among inerrancy believers ranges from uncertainty,\\nto avoiding the subject, to certainty that the list is incomplete. Barrick,\\nhimself, like Unger feels Shem's list is incomplete. In my own research I\\nhave concluded that not one of the world's 100 leading evangelical,\\ninerrancy, OT scholars believes Shem's list is complete. The question that\\nkept troubling me as I began working on this subject twelve years ago was\\nwhy none of these scholars had published a satisfactory scheme to account\\nfor the missing time.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIn circulating this idea of an immediate and long-term impact of the Flood,\\nI have found that about 90-95% of those who understand Scripture to be\\ninerrant (the foundation of this book) say it makes sense. But the 5-10% of\\nthose who have spent years teaching the Ussher dates for the Flood and\\nCreation find my ideas difficult to accept. Rather than giving them careful\\nconsideration, they typically go on the offensive. They repeat their\\narguments even though this book has systematically shown their arguments to\\nbe defective. In their zeal they don't even seem to understand the answers\\nthis book provides.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe situation is grave. Apart from accepting a biblical solution that\\nreveals an earlier date for the Flood, the Ussher thinking creation\\nscientists will continue to discredit the creation science they so\\nself-sacrificially pursue, in effect, shooting themselves in the foot. I\\nhave been asked how they discredit the very science they use to dismiss\\nevolution and recognize a Creator. Actually, it should be obvious. By\\ngiving a Flood date that is clearly too late, their critics leap for joy,\\nannouncing to all who will hear that since they are obviously wrong on the\\ndate of the Flood, their creation science surely must be equally flawed.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Credit to Creation Scientists </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nMaybe the following line of thinking will help creation scientists to\\nunderstand how important their work has been in recognizing the gap in the\\nShem genealogy. It is not unreasonable to conclude that only because of\\ntheir work could this solution be discovered. Creationists for some 50\\nyears have been plumbing the violence of the Flood. Creation geologists\\nhave pointed to vast formations laid down quickly until they are blue in\\nthe face. Those formations give overwhelming evidence for immediate,\\ncontinuous deposition, not over long periods of time. The entire earth\\nbears a consistent testimony to these formations being deposited rapidly,\\nsuddenly, indicating a steadily rising sea level as Genesis 7: 17-18 says.\\nNow with this new information revealing the incredible violence of the\\nFlood, Christians could make sense of these declines in human longevity.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAdding to the work of creation scientists, historical errors that obscured\\nShem's line are now corrected (see chapter 13). The recent clarification of\\nExodus 12:40 eliminated the 215-year Egyptian sojourn error. In addition,\\nscholars have discovered how to translate millions of recently discovered\\ndocuments written in cuneiform and hieroglyphics. And most recently, the\\nDead Sea Scrolls which show the care of copying Scripture and the various\\nHebrew textual families that existed between 50 BC and 70 AD were\\ndiscovered and their secrets learned. (See chapter 8.) These findings have\\nhelped correct dozens of misinterpretations in the lives of Abraham and\\nJacob. (See chapter 14.) None of this information was available to\\nJosephus, the church fathers or Ussher.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThose changes to human longevity may have been a direct act of God, a side\\neffect of the Flood or a combination of the two. Whatever the cause it is\\nworth pondering the forces the Flood released on the world. First, the\\nFlood released 500 million years' worth of nuclear decay according to RATE\\nfindings published in 2005. It also released radon and chemicals which are\\nharmful genetically. In addition, it caused rapid polar reverses. With\\nthought many harmful forces could be listed. What did they do to the Ark\\npassengers?\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBut one thing is certain. When Shem and his wife got off the Ark and\\nparented their first son, Arpachshad, they gave him genes that only enabled\\nhim to live about 450 years, not 900. When that son and his wife\\nprocreated, they passed on the only genes they had, the ones they had\\nreceived from their parents after the Flood. When Shem's grandson Shelah\\nand his wife procreated, they likewise passed on the same reproductive\\ngenes that were somehow reset at the time of the Flood. That resetting now\\nled to a new longevity for mankind-450 years instead of 900 years. The\\nfirst halving of longevity began with the first generation born after the\\nFlood.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWhile the immediate and long-term effects of the Flood were very different,\\na big stumbling block to distinguishing between them is the common practice\\nof including the years of Noah and Shem on a continuous chart of lifespans.\\nThat practice is one of the causes of this 2000-year-old error and will\\nalways hide the correct answer. Noah and Shem must be viewed as special\\ncases and treated separately. For this a careful explanation is coming up\\nthat will provide the reasons for keeping Noah and Shem from either Adam's\\nor Shem's chart when viewed for the purpose of declining longevity.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>More Considerations of the Long-Term Impacts of the Flood</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nNow for a more careful look at the second impact of the Flood which we call\\n\\\"The Long-Term Impact of the Flood.\\\" The second halving of human longevity\\ncould also have been a direct act of God or a long-term result of the\\nviolence of the Flood or a combination of the two. But Genesis 8:22\\nintroduces a new possibility: \\\"seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer\\nand winter, day and night.\\\" While God promised not to send another global\\nFlood and He promised to continue providing an earth that would sustain\\nlife, it seems that this verse is stating that making a living would take\\nmore effort and planning, and be more precarious. It seems to indicate some\\nkind of change in the annual processes of nature. However, some\\ncommentators understand this to be a promise that, just as before, there\\nwould continue to be seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and\\nwinter, day and night.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nStill, creation scientists favor the view that pre-Flood man lived in a\\nmore predictable, semi-tropical climate unthreatened by natural disasters\\nand very possibly shielded from solar radiation. Now he would experience\\ncrop failure, four definite seasons, powerful earthquakes, volcanic\\nactivity, violent weather and the Ice Age. Formerly food grew year around;\\nnow there would be seedtime and harvest. Whereas before a more uniform\\nclimate extended from pole-to-pole year around, now there would be cold and\\nheat. Near the equator and in desert regions man would learn to survive\\nduring times of intense heat and unpredictable precipitation while near the\\npoles he would learn to survive in times of intense cold.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nHeat and cold would produce deadly storms and killing drought. Even more\\nominous, heat in the oceans (estimated as high as 86<sup>o</sup> in some\\nareas) would produce an ice age while tectonic plate movement would produce\\nearthquakes and lift mountain ranges into the clouds. Additionally, the\\nhuman gene pool would acquire mutations that gradually reduced fitness and\\nthus longevity. While the above view may be somewhat modified over the\\nyears by creation scientists, there currently is much to commend it.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThese changes placed unique stresses on mankind. Scripture says the Ark\\nlanded in the mountains of Ararat, but that name was given after the\\nmountains formed. Many of those mountains are volcanoes. Mount Ararat\\nitself would eventually grow to 17,000 feet above sea level and the entire\\nregion would rise to become a plateau nearly 3000 feet high, much of it\\nvolcanic rock. Rising mountains and volcanism were happening worldwide.\\nThese volcanoes released ash that blanketed the earth for centuries and\\nlowered summer surface temperatures significantly. Migration to Lower\\nMesopotamia and on to Arabia and the southern Mediterranean brought some\\nrelief from the volcanic activity and the growing cold.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIf this view is correct the new world certainly contributed to the second\\neffect of the Flood, although it may not have been the primary cause of\\nthis second effect. It seems that this second effect gradually wore away\\nthe vitality of mankind, producing a continuous decline of longevity.\\nBecause the decline was gradual and continued from the Flood until Moses,\\nShem's list must reflect it. The first records of decline between\\ngenerations were five and 4.5 years. Such a small decline is only about a\\n1% difference in lifespans between generations. We are dealing with\\naverages, but averages are made up of different numbers and each individual\\nis different. So, in the midst of such small changes, one might not think\\nof occasional variations of, say 25 (5%) or even 50 (10%) years as unusual\\nand that is true. But the decline between Eber and Peleg was not the\\nstandard 4.5 or five years or even 25 or 50 years. It was an enormous 225\\nyear decline, 61% of the entire decline from the Flood until Moses. To\\nvisualize all the average generations needed to produce a 225-year decline,\\nthe next paragraph explores such calculations.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe first six names in Shem's list provide differences over five\\ngenerations. The difference between the first and second names, Arpachshad\\nand Shelah, was just five years. The difference between the second and\\nthird names was 31 years but these 31 years were an increase in lifespans,\\nnot a decrease. But the increase was not 450 years (a 100% increase) so as\\nto give Eber a lifespan like that of pre-Flood people, but simply an\\nincrease of 6.5% over that of his father and grandfather. The difference\\nbetween the fourth and sixth names was nine years or an average of 4.5\\nyears per generation. On this basis of 4.5-5 years of decline per\\ngeneration, if one generation was omitted, on average the grandson would\\nlive nine or ten fewer years and this would be reflected in his reported\\nlifespan. The son following an omission of four generations would live\\n18-20 fewer years. The son following an omission of eight generations would\\nlive 36-40 fewer years. The son following an omission of 16 generations\\nwould live 72-80 fewer years. The son following an omission of 32\\ngenerations would live 144-160 fewer years. Now we get to the actual number\\ngiven in Scripture, the 225 year decrease between Eber and Peleg: on the\\nbasis of a 4.5-5 year average generational decline, that son would follow\\nthe omission of 45-50 generations.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe first thought that comes to mind is that Peleg was an exception. But\\nthis cannot be, because his son Reu also lived to the same age. If Peleg\\ndied due to an accident or sickness, Reu would have lived 8-10 years fewer\\nthan Eber, but he also lived 225 fewer years than Eber. Even if both Peleg\\nand Reu were exceptions, one would expect Reu's son Serug to have lived\\nsimply 13.5-15 fewer years than Eber, but he lived 234 fewer years than\\nEber. Peleg was not an exception. He lived a normal lifetime and no one\\nborn after him is recorded to have lived longer than he lived. His lifespan\\ntestifies to being born many generations after Eber. Thus, beget is used in\\nthe broad sense of Peleg being the son of Eber through many intermediate\\nfathers. Modern terminology would call Peleg a descendant of Eber. Next, we\\nmust carefully document the gradual but continual decline of longevity\\nbetween the Flood and Moses.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Specific Records of Longevity Decline</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWe previously saw that there was no decline of longevity over the\\ngenerations that lived and died before the Flood. To repeat: on average\\neach person in Adam's list (Genesis 5) who lived and died before the Flood\\nlived about 900 years. Now we are ready to examine the post-Flood record\\nwhich reflects a gradual but continuing decline of longevity in contrast to\\nthe pre-Flood record of no longevity decline at all. The decline from the\\nfirst generation (Arpachshad-438 years) to second generation (Shelah-433\\nyears) of those born after the Flood was five years. Shelah's son Eber\\nlived longer than his father or grandfather and is an exception that we\\nwill deal with later.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe next three names in Shem's list are the fourth, fifth and six names.\\nThey come immediately after the gap between Eber and Peleg. Both Peleg and\\nhis son Reu lived 239 years while Reu's son Serug lived to the age of 230.\\nThus, there was no decline between the fourth and fifth names, but the\\nsixth named person, Serug lived nine fewer years than either his father or\\ngrandfather. This nine year decline produces an average decline of 4.5\\nyears per generation. Thus, the two periods record declines of five years\\nfrom the first to the second names and nine years from the fourth to the\\nsixth names. Apart from the 31-year increase from Shelah to Eber, these are\\nthe first specific records of lifespans after the Flood and they are nearly\\nidentical. Five to 4.5 years per generation is a change of a mere half year\\nper generation in 35 to 55 generations.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nOur third set of specific lifespans comes from Jacob's record which jumps\\ndown to the time in Canaan and Egypt, about 600 years after the second\\nmeasure and two millennia after the first measure. Jacob lived to the age\\nof 147. His son Levi lived to the age of 137. Levi's son Kohath lived to\\nthe age of 133 and Kohath's son Amram lived to the age of 137. A casual\\nlook finds the total decline from Jacob to Amram (four fathers or three\\ngenerations) was 10 years (147-137=10) or 3.3 years per generation. A more\\ncareful look at this apparent decline will be offered later. At least on\\nthe surface we have a specific recorded decline of five years per\\ngeneration immediately after the Flood, a specific recorded decline of 4.5\\nyears per generation for two generations between one and two millennia\\nlater and a possible recorded decline of 3.3 years per generation over\\nthree generations half a millennium after that.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nNow we jump down to a clear final decline of man's longevity, from Amram to\\nMoses. They also were in the line of Levi. While the final notice of\\ndecline was Psalm 90:10 in which Moses wrote that man's lifespan would be\\n70 or 80, these lifespans reflected the judgment of God on Israel's\\nunbelief and the resulting death of an entire generation in the wilderness.\\nIn contrast Moses lived to the age of 120. Since Israel completed their 40\\nyears in the desert in 1406 BC, Moses was born in 1526 BC. While the exact\\ndate of his forefather Amram is not known, Scripture says Amram was born in\\nEgypt, married a daughter of Levi and his father was apparently an adult,\\nso we place his birth shortly after the beginning of the Egyptian sojourn,\\nsay about 1870 BC. Thus we are measuring from birth to birth rather from\\ndeath to death since these are the firmer numbers. Amram lived 137 years\\nand Moses 120 years, so the decrease in longevity was 17 years. The years\\nthat passed are as follows: 1870 &amp; 1527 or 244 years. The generations\\ninvolved are: 244/25=10. Thus declining longevity was 1.7 years per\\ngeneration in this final measure.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSo, Scripture provides four rough measures of lifespans over about 2500\\nyears. Immediately after the Flood man's lifespan 450 years. Then, 1500\\nyears later it was 236 years. Five hundred years after that it was down to\\n140 and yet 500 years still later it stood at 120. Would anyone question\\nthat Scripture charts a continual decline of longevity from the Flood to\\nthe death of Moses 2.5 millennia later. It would seem this gradual decline\\nadequately explains the halving between Eber and Peleg. Most definitely God\\nhad given Abraham's line unusual strength and longevity. Many of the\\nbiblical numbers are at the high end of human longevity. This is especially\\nseen in Levi's line concluding with Moses and his two siblings who all\\nreached the age of 120 or more at the point where the average lifespan was\\n70. But even working with numbers that are at the high end of longevity\\nthere was still a clear and continuous decline from the Flood to Moses.\\n</p>\\n<h3>\\nTwo Standards for Starting New Generations\\n</h3>\\n<p>\\nKnowing the number of missing generations is one of two numbers needed to\\ndetermine the time of the Flood. The years represented by each generation\\nmust also be known. Then the number of missing generations will be\\nmultiplied by the years in a generation to determine how many years are\\nmissing between Eber and Peleg. The years in a generation will also be used\\nwhen the total number of years is known but the number of generations is\\nnot known as in the case of the Egyptian sojourn.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAs the records are studied it is apparent that as longevity decreased, the\\nyears to adulthood and thus producing offspring also decreased. While one\\nmight suspect this to be true, the record clearly shows it did happen.\\nThose who lived about 900 years started families when they were about 100.\\nWhile this does not help us find any missing generations before the Flood,\\nit strongly establishes the concept of declining years to adulthood being a\\nfunction of declining longevity. For our specific task we use 32 years to\\nrepresent adulthood between Arpachshad and Jacob and 20 years in the period\\nafter Jacob, a total of 12 years decline in reaching adulthood after the\\nFlood.\\n</p>\\n<h4>\\n1. Standard Number One: 32 years\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\nIn the first grouping following the Flood (Arpachshad-Shelah-Eber),\\nfamilies began when fathers were 35, 30 and 34 or an average age of 33. In\\nthe second grouping (Peleg-Reu-Serug-Nahor), families began when the\\nfathers were 30, 32, 30 and 29 or an average age of 30.25. To average all\\nseven, we sum them (35+30+34+30+32+30+20=220) and divide by seven\\n(220/7=31.43). To remain conservative and for sake of ease we rounded this\\nnumber up to 32. Thirty-two then becomes the average number of years in\\neach generation missing between Eber and Peleg. By way of example if ten\\ngenerations were missing between Eber and Peleg, 320 years would need to be\\nadded to the Shem line total to determine the time of the Flood (32 x 10 =\\n320).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nFollowing the first seven fathers named above, the next four fathers\\nstarted families very late due to unusual circumstances: Terah at age 70,\\nAbraham at age 86, Isaac at age 60 and Jacob at age 82. Each was an\\nextraordinary situation. Infertility was the difficulty in the first three\\noccasions, each of which involved Terah's line. For some reason he did not\\nfather Abraham until he was 130. Scripture specifically states that Sarah,\\nAbraham's wife and an offspring of Terah, was barren. By divine\\nintervention she and Abraham had their first and only son when Abraham was\\n100. Abraham's son Isaac was also married to a descendant of Terah and did\\nnot father an offspring by his wife Rebekah until God answered his prayer\\nfor offspring twenty years after they were married (Genesis 25:21). By that\\ntime Isaac was 60.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nJacob's situation is more unusual yet. Since Abraham arranged a marriage\\nfor Isaac when Isaac was 40, Jacob and his twin brother Esau likely\\nexpected that their father would arrange a marriage for them when they\\nturned 40. Unfortunately, Isaac did not. When Isaac did not act Esau took\\nnot one but two Canaanite wives. They so distressed his mother that Jacob,\\nbeing sensitive to his mother's feelings, decided to wait. It would be\\nanother 42 years before Jacob was married and his first child was born.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nDetermining the beginning of new generations on the basis of Terah,\\nAbraham, Isaac and Jacob would miss the average by a country mile. Yet,\\ntheir ages are frequently used as the measure of a generation and this is\\none of the reasons our declining longevity argument has been so well\\nhidden. Since they are unusual cases, we will use the standard of 32 years\\nderived from Arpachshad through Nahor in determining generations from the\\nFlood down to the time of Jacob. In this way Terah being 130 when he begat\\nAbraham represents four normal generations while Abraham fathering Isaac at\\nthe age of 100 represents three typical generations.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIn the same way Isaac fathering the twins at the age of 60 represents two\\ngenerations and Jacob beginning his family at the age of 82 represents\\nnearly three generations. So while one might protest about a 5-4.5 year\\ndecline of longevity per generation and point to the 30 year decline\\nbetween Terah and Abraham, that decline must be viewed in terms of four\\ngenerations. This concept is further strengthened when one considers the 25\\nyear decline from Terah to Isaac. It happened over the equivalent of seven\\ngenerations. When viewed that way, the 5-4.5 year decline is in the ball\\npark (25/7 = 3.5 year decline per generation). On the other hand, Abraham\\nand Jacob lived more stressful lives than Isaac.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAnother confirmation of this general principle is that as longevity\\ndecreased so did the potential start of each new generation. Eber and Peleg\\nstarted their families at 34 and 30. But those after Jacob started their\\nfamilies even before the age of 20. Thus the age for reaching adulthood\\ngradually declined to about 20 by the period following Jacob.\\n</p>\\n<h4>\\n2. Standard Number Two: 25 years\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\nAbove we stated that the age of adulthood after Jacob was around 20. That\\nis the record. But in the following discussion we will show that reaching\\nadulthood and starting a family did not coincide as it did in the\\ngenerations after the Flood when God's command to repopulate the earth was\\nparamount. So we have decided on age 25 for starting new generations in\\nthis second time span.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAgain Scripture provides us with much useful data-in this case, Jacob's\\nextended family that accompanied him to Egypt (Genesis 46:8-27). While\\nJacob started his family in his 80's and even his twin brother waited until\\nhe was 40, Jacob's sons began having families in their twenties and even\\nbefore they were twenty. Case in point: we know the most about Judah's\\nfathering in the years before the relocation to Egypt when Judah was 45. In\\nthose 45 years Judah grew up, married and fathered three sons. Furthermore,\\nhis three sons grew up, two married and the third reached the age of\\nmarriage all in the same 45 years. Then Judah committed incest with the\\nwidow of his second son, thereby starting a third generation family. His\\nsecond group of sons (twins by his daughter-in-law) should have been\\ngrandsons. This works out to starting the next generation when he was 23\\nand the third when he was 45-two generations in 45 years or 22.5 years per\\ngeneration.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSome will protest that this was an unusual circumstance and requires an\\nadjustment. Having sons through his daughter-in-law certainly was unusual.\\nWhat should have happened is that when his first son was married at the age\\nof 20, that son should have fathered a child instead of spilling his seed\\non the ground so that the LORD slew him. Then these two successive\\ngenerations would have started when the fathers were 23 and 21 or an\\naverage of 22 years per father.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBut that is not all. The second family Judah fathered consisted of\\ntwins-Zerah and Perez. The twins were born just before or just after the\\nmove to Egypt. But those named who moved to Egypt include two sons of Perez\\neven though they were still in the womb and would not be born for another\\n20 or 25 years (Genesis 46:12). If this were not the case, a fourth\\ngeneration would have been added to Judah's line by the time he was 45.\\nThis would amount to new generations starting when each father was 15 years\\nold which is highly unlikely. Since Hebrew genealogies are flexible, the\\nwriter of this part of Genesis chose to provide a fuller record of Jacob's\\nlineage in Egypt, so he included sons still in the womb who would be born\\nin Egypt.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe record of Benjamin tops them all, further illustrating the idea of sons\\nborn to a very young father and even including unborn sons in this\\nextensive list of Jacob's heirs that accompanied him to Egypt. Benjamin was\\n24 when they moved to Egypt in 1876 BC. Genesis 46:21 lists ten sons for\\nhim! If they were all alive at the time of the move Benjamin would have had\\nto have multiple wives and start having sons in his teens. Most likely some\\nwere grandsons or even great grandsons. Further, several are attributed to\\nanother of Jacob's sons in another passage, so apparently a scribal error\\ncontributes to the confusion, but a few must have been alive at the time of\\nthe move meaning he was in his late teens or early twenties when he started\\nhis family.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThree sons are listed for Levi (Exodus 6:16) who was 46 at the time of the\\nmove. Since no sons are listed for Kohath at the time of the move, Kohath's\\nson Amram was born after the move to Egypt. Consequently, Kohath could have\\nbeen an adult at the time of the move. Amram married a daughter Levi\\nfathered after the move (Numbers 26:59). So unless she was born when Levi\\nwas elderly, the two male generations, Kohath and Amram, must have been\\nborn when their fathers were in their mid-twenties.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAt the time of the move Jacob's sons ranged from age 48 for Reuben to age\\n39 for Joseph plus Benjamin who came along later and was 24. Each of\\nJacob's sons had at least one named son at the time of the move\\ndemonstrating the vigor of his line. It seems that some of his fifty plus\\ngrandsons were well beyond infancy. All of this points to the sons of Jacob\\nstarting families in their teens and twenties.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBy the time of the Exodus 430-years later all able-bodied males aged 20-50\\nserved in Moses' citizen army to defend their infant nation. Presumably, if\\na 20-year-old was considered old enough to risk his life in defense of his\\ncountry, he was also old enough to marry and start a family. So the decline\\nof longevity to the age of 70 was accompanied by the decline in reaching\\nadulthood at the age of 20. As stated above this would be a 12 year decline\\nin reaching maturity.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nHowever, those early generations needed to repopulate the earth so they\\nstarted families as soon as they were able. As we have seen, Jacob's sons\\nwere commonly starting families by the age of 20. Thus the potential age\\nfor starting families shrunk from 32 to 20. Nevertheless, for our purposes\\nwe need averages, not potential. By the time Israel was in Egypt and after,\\neven though young men could potentially start families at 20, they had the\\nleisure of starting them later and many examples are found of those who\\nstarted families later, even Joseph the step-father of Jesus. As a result,\\nwe suggest using the age of 25 for determining generations during this\\nperiod. Using 25 rather than 20 decreases the number of generations in\\nEgypt by 20%.\\n</p>\\n<h3>\\nEstimates of Omitted Generations and Year of the Flood\\n</h3>\\n<p align=\\\"center\\\">\\n(See also Appendix Table 7.4)\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nNow we can estimate when the Flood happened, but this estimate is only a\\nbroad range of years, not a specific year. Following that will be an\\nexplanation of how these numbers were reached and the many variables. By\\nrecognizing omitted generations between Eber and Peleg the Flood dates\\nbetween 4300 and 3600 BC. These dates are particularly encouraging to those\\nwho accept the Bible as divinely inspired because they encompass the\\nearliest well-established post-Flood civilizations of mankind revealed by\\noverwhelming secular evidence. In fact, Scripture indicates that those who\\ngot off the Ark quickly established an advanced civilization. Further,\\nthese numbers provide more years than the LXX which some creationists are\\nresorting to.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe maximum date for the Flood is found by recognizing a 225 year decline\\nbetween Eber and Peleg, an average decline of 4.5 years per generation and\\na 200 year quiet period immediately following the Flood to restart life. By\\ndividing the total decline (225 years) by the decline per generation (4.5\\nyears), 50 generations are found to be missing (225/4.5=50). The 200 quiet\\nyears give another 6.25 generations for a total of 56.25 generations. Since\\ngenerations started every 32 years, by these considerations 1800 years are\\nmissing between Eber and Peleg (32x56.25=1800).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBefore the gap is a period of 101 years-the two years until the birth of\\nArpachshad, the 35 until he fathered Shelah, the 30 until Shelah fathered\\nEber and the 34 until Eber fathered the first unrecorded generation\\n(2+35+30+34=101). By including the years until the birth of the first\\nunknown generation (101) and the years from the birth of Peleg to Christ\\n(2417), the maximum date of the Flood would be 4318 BC or 4300 BC for a\\nround number (1800+101+2417=4318).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe minimum date for the Flood is found by assuming that Eber had\\nextraordinary vigor and that if he had been average, he would have lived\\nfive fewer years than his father Shelah. Using 189 years of total decline\\nbetween Eber and Peleg and five years for the average decline sets the\\nnumber of missing generations at 37.8. Assuming also that during the most\\nsevere part of the Ice Age longevity decreased more rapidly, we round those\\ngenerations down to 35. Multiplying 35 by the exact number of years per\\ngeneration (31.43) calculates to 1100 years missing from the record\\n(31.43x35=1100). Adding the years in the gap to those before and after\\ngives the minimum time of the Flood as 3618 BC (1100+101+2417=3618).\\nRounding 3618 to the nearest 100 gives a round figure range of 3600-4300\\nBC.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nA friend saw these estimates of the missing generations between Eber and\\nPeleg and took strong exception. He said four calendars from different\\nparts of the world (China, India, Europe and the Americas) all point to\\nabout 4000 BC as the beginning of the earth. He said to read    <em>After the Flood</em> by Bill Cooper. Amazingly, Cooper cited three\\ncalendars that he felt were free of major internal contradictions. All\\nthree placed creation at 4700 BC or earlier. Of the three he considered the\\nParker Chronicle to be the most reliable. It is Anglo-Saxon and places\\ncreation at 5200 BC.<a href=\\\"#_ftn1\\\" name=\\\"_ftnref1\\\" title=\\\"\\\">[1]</a> By\\nadding the biblical years before the Flood (1656) to our range of Flood\\ndates (4300-3600 BC), creation falls in the range of 5956-5256 BC which is\\nnot that much greater than the Parker Chronicle and our dates come solely\\nfrom studying God's Word.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    Calculating Peleg's Year of Birth (See also Appendix Table 7.1)\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThis paper tags 2417 BC as the year of Peleg's birth. The trail to that\\ndate begins with Jacob's move to Egypt in 1876 BC, the standard date\\npreferred by Evangelicals. When he came to Egypt, Pharaoh asked his age.\\nJacob replied that he was 130 years old (Genesis 47:9). By adding 130 to\\nthe 1876 BC date, we find Jacob was born in 2006 BC (1876+130=2006). Isaac\\nwas 60 when Jacob was born (2006+60=2066). Abraham was 100 when Isaac was\\nborn (2066+100=2166). By adding the numbers for the years of five previous\\nfathers (Terah-130; Nahor-29; Serug-30; Reu-32; Peleg-30 = 251), we find\\nPeleg was born about 2417 BC (2166 + 251 = 2417).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe year Levi was born is determined as follows. Joseph was elevated at the\\nage of 30 (Genesis 41:46). Seven years of plenty and two years of famine\\nhad passed so Joseph was 39 when Pharaoh asked his father's age and Jacob\\nreplied that he was 130. Thus, Joseph was born when his father was 91\\n(130-39=91) which would place Joseph's birth at 1915 BC (2006-91=1915).\\nJoseph was the youngest of the eleven sons born to Jacob in Haran in just\\nnine years so his oldest brother Reuben would have been born in 1924 BC\\n(1915+9=1924) and the third oldest, Levi would have been born in 1922 BC\\n(1924-2=1922).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Individuals not fitting the pattern</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAverages must be protected from exceptions and unusual circumstances. Both\\nunusually vigorous people and people with lifespans considerably less than\\nthe average must be treated with care and when justified appropriate\\nadjustments must be made. Possibly such a case is Eber, the third\\ngeneration descendant of Shem who lived 464 years which is 31 years longer\\nthan his father Shelah (433 years). With Eber longevity increased rather\\nthan decreased. This is contrary to the general trend so he was likely\\nunusually vigorous, but just how vigorous? His father and he could be\\ntreated like Peleg and Reu who both lived to the age of 239 immediately\\nafter the gap. With that adjustment Eber would be considered as living 433\\nyears like his father. Or apart from unusual vitality again for sake of\\naverages, he could be counted as living five fewer years than his father\\njust as his father lived five fewer years than his grandfather. That would\\nestablish his lifespan at 428 years for the sake of averages and produce a\\nlongevity decline of 189 years (428-239=189). This would calculate to 38\\nmissing generations (189/5=38) or 1216 years (32x38=1216) and place the\\nFlood at 3734 BC (2517+101+1216=3734 BC). More on Eber later.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nFollowing Serug was Nahor who lived a short 148 years. He does not fit the\\npattern. Maybe he was sickly but more likely he died from violence or in\\nsome kind of accident. (Similarly, we suspect Lamech died from violence.)\\nSo his years do not contribute to our search for the average decline per\\ngeneration. But a minor skipping of generations may have occurred between\\nSerug and Nahor. In David's line were three groups of three consecutive\\nindividuals with a relatively equal number of omissions between each group\\nof three. If Moses were skipping two groups of names, the second gap would\\nfall between Serug and Nahor. However, the decline between Serug and\\nNahor's son is only 25 years. At most 25 years only represents five or six\\ngenerations and such a small number (25 years) is not beyond the deviation\\nfrom averages.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWe have already mentioned his son, Terah, who also does not fit the pattern\\nalready established. While his grandfather Serug lived 230 years, Terah\\nlived 205 years, a 25 year decrease over two generations. Further he bore\\nhis first son at the age of 70 while all the preceding fathers born after\\nthe Flood fathered their first sons between the ages of 29 and 35. For\\nthese reasons we feel that the records of Nahor and Terah do not fit the\\nclear pattern of the three born before the gap and the three born after the\\ngap, so we are not using them in our search for the average years of\\nlongevity decline after the Flood.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAnother exception could be Jacob's years. He describes how Laban exploited\\nhim for 20 years (Genesis 31:38-42). He was like a slave to Laban. After\\nreturning to Canaan he appointed Joseph to supervise his older brothers. He\\nmight have done this because he was worn out by that time. You might say he\\nworked himself to death and thus died sooner than he would have otherwise.\\nThus, he most likely died younger than if he had not worked so hard.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAn entirely different consideration is the work of God in judging unbelief\\nwhile giving certain leaders and the line of Christ greater years and\\nvitality. History records that in the early second millennium BC pharaohs\\nwere living about 60 years. Yet Joseph lived 110 years and each of those\\nfirst three fathers in the line of Levi lived about 135 years. Even more\\nstartling four centuries later Mariam, Aaron and Moses all lived 120 years\\nor more. Yet Moses wrote in his final days that a full lifetime was 70\\nyears (Psalm 90:10). Possibly God supernaturally granted more years to\\nMoses and his siblings in order to found the nation.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nHowever, the 70 year standard might have been related to the judgment of\\nGod on the Exodus generation. Because of their unbelief God said they would\\nnot enter the Promised Land. Hebrews three relates that an entire\\ngeneration other than those who believed God perished in the wilderness. It\\ncould be that the 70 year standard Moses wrote of took more time to become\\nfully established after his death.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<a name=\\\"_Hlk75171914\\\"><strong>Noah and Shem</strong></a>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nNoah and his son Shem are special cases in a category by themselves. Since\\nboth were born before the Flood they received the genes that called for 900\\nyear life spans. As a result, both lived a long time after the Flood-Noah\\n350 years and Shem 500 years. There are reasonable explanations for how\\nthey could live so many years after the Flood when the new normal lifespan\\nof those born after the Flood was 450 years. It is common medical knowledge\\nthat genes given at birth plus those replacements in one's early years have\\nthe most effect on one's lifespan. Noah was 600 years old when the Flood\\ncame. His physical body developed for 600 years under pre-Flood conditions.\\nCertainly his walk with God gave him extra vitality. Because of all those\\npre-Flood years, the new conditions after the Flood most likely had less\\neffect on him. If he had lived his entire lifetime before the Flood,\\nperhaps he would have lived over 1000 years and set the record for the\\nlongest lifespan in human history. He also lived during those first two\\nhundred years after the Flood that may have been a quiet time especially\\ngiven by God for the Ark passengers to get on their feet before the Ice Age\\nbegan taking its toll.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWhile Noah lived 1/3 of his life after the Flood, Shem lived 5/6ths of his\\nlife after the deluge. He only had 100 years to develop his body before the\\nhard times following the Flood. Without the impact of the Flood Shem most\\nlikely would have lived 900 years like his forefathers. Thus, it must be\\nthat those 500 years after the Flood had a much greater impact on his body\\nthan the 350 years his father lived after the Flood had on his father's\\nbody. As his father's heir, possibly the burdens of leadership and\\nespecially upholding faith in God after the Flood could well have taken\\ntheir toll on his lifespan.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nHe may also have chosen to remain in the growing mountains of Ararat where\\nthe climate was more severe rather than in the Mesopotamian civilization\\nbowl where Noah's descendants were defying God at Babel. His life may even\\nhave been cut short by accident or violence. So while Shem was not given\\nthose post-Flood genes which would have cut his life to 450 years, his body\\ndid bear the impact of living under the new conditions far more than it did\\non his father's body. Thus, Noah and Shem must not be cited in the\\naverages. To include them is to compare oranges with apples and thus to\\nobscure the powerful impact the Flood had on human longevity.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<a name=\\\"_Hlk75171983\\\">\\n    <strong>Further Considerations on Eber, the Wild Card</strong>\\n</a>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nEber lived 31 years longer than his father Shelah and 26 years longer than\\nhis grandfather who was born two years after the Flood. This might indicate\\nthat longevity actually increased in the third generation or at a minimum\\nthat there was no overall longevity decrease in the early years after the\\nFlood. But again, for some unexplained reason God may have given Eber\\ngreater vitality. Or, it might have been like this-God may have sent a\\nquiet period giving the eight ark survivors and their new families time to\\ntransition from food supplies on the ark to farming and shepherding. They\\nalso may have spent years salvaging the building materials used in the\\nark's construction, moving them to a safe location before the Ice Age\\ngained momentum. Possibly Eber's father and grandfather in effect worked\\nthemselves to an early grave as they labored to restart human life after\\nthe Flood so Eber had it a little easier. Eber could have lived in the\\nMesopotamian basin where the Ice Age had less effect while Shem and sons\\ncould have stayed in regions closer to the Ararat Mountains which\\nexperienced more severe weather.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nPossibly Eber's 464 years is the true longevity number for those first\\ngenerations after the Flood. So enjoying unusual vitality, having it a\\nlittle easier or not being the victim of sickness, an accident or foul play\\ncould explain Eber's longer lifespan. Because we do not know why Eber lived\\nlonger, he is something of a wild card. Just how one sees Eber's longer\\nlifespan will affect his view of the number of years missing between Eber\\nand Peleg. This uncertainty and the many exceptions previously noted\\nrequire humility in approaching our subject and remind us again that God\\nhas only chosen to give us a general idea of the time of the Flood and not\\na more exact time.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nFinally, we must recognize that the entire period from Eber to Moses was\\none of continuous, gradual declining longevity, but it would seem that the\\ndecline would not be a straight line. Rather it would be faster or slower\\ndepending on the level of stress and the location of the individual.\\nStressful conditions such as living in the teeth of the Ice Age or living\\nas a slave would certainly reduce longevity faster. Yet even as some bore\\nthe rigors of the Ice Age the far greater population lived in the more\\nagreeable climates of Southern Mesopotamia and Arabia. Maybe warfare and\\nviolence did as much to decrease their longevity as natural conditions.\\nNevertheless, the amount of generational decline most likely varied from\\nregion to region and from period to period. Our records come mostly from\\njust one family line so they reflect the region and the period of that\\nline's experiences.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<a name=\\\"_Hlk75448735\\\"><strong>Shem's List - Not a Chronology</strong></a>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThis chapter has presented strong evidence that Shem's genealogy in Genesis\\n11:10-26 is not a chronology. But those begetting numbers have great value\\nas they reveal that the Flood marked both an immediate and long term\\ndecline in human longevity. Further, they disclose the vast difference\\nbetween pre-Flood and post-Flood conditions. Most importantly, they show\\nthe effects of sin.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIt was easy to conclude Shem's list was a chronology because the begetting\\nage of each father is given, ten consecutive fathers with eight consecutive\\nbegetting numbers. But like a red flag Scripture does not add those numbers\\neven though it gives important chronological totals elsewhere such as the\\n430-years in Egypt (Exodus 12:40) and the 480 years from the Exodus to the\\nTemple (I Kings 6:1). In fact it neither invites the reader to add those\\nnumbers nor even gives a single hint that those numbers should be\\nconsidered a chronology. While the silence of Scripture does not close the\\nissue, it is a strong witness against the chronology argument.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBut Shem's list does give an obvious clue that its objective was something\\nother than a chronology. It's ten names are matched by ten names in Adam's\\nlist. Symmetry, not chronology appears to be the goal of placing ten names\\nin each list. Ten representative names from Adam to Noah and ten more from\\nShem to Abraham beginning the line to the Redeemer first promised in\\nGenesis 3:15.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nViewing Shem's list as a chronology is an interpretation, not a fact.\\nInterpretations of Scripture and facts of Scripture must be carefully\\ndistinguished. The Gospel is a fact. That Jesus is the predicted Messiah of\\nthe OT is a fact. That Shem's list is a chronology doesn't qualify as a\\nfact. A special branch of bibliology is called hermeneutics, the science of\\nhow to interpret Scripture. The most basic rule of hermeneutics is to\\ncompare Scripture with Scripture. This is the rite of passage that\\ndetermines how the particular author of a passage meant his words to be\\nunderstood.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nHow did the author of Shem's list use those words? The answer lies in how\\nother Scriptures use genealogical concepts. Eventually it becomes apparent\\nthat they were about relating fathers to sons and sons to fathers, not\\ngiving exhaustive and complete lists. In effect they were used as this book\\nfinds in these first 100 plus pages. Identity was the issue, not history.\\nUltimately, Adam's line comes to a specific person named Noah and Noah's\\nline comes to a specific person named Abraham whose descendants God will\\nuse to form the nation Israel and send the Savior. While it may be\\nembarrassing or humiliating, those holding the chronological view must\\nteach their followings the true way to view Shem's list.\\n</p>\\n<h3>\\nRecords Illustrating the Decline in Human Longevity\\n</h3>\\n<p>\\nThe information we have covered is summarized below in outline form.

But the judgment was\\nnot the shortening of lifetimes. It was the sentence to stay in the\\nwilderness until an entire generation perished. By the end of that time\\nMoses observed that the normal full lifetime of man was 70 years. Joseph\\ndied at 110 early in the Egyptian sojourn. It seems that these 40 years of\\ndecline (110-70=40) occurred over about 400 years, from 1800 to 1400 BC.\\nThat amounts to a decline of approximately 2.8 years per generation, but it\\nwas a decline under the great stresses of slavery and the wilderness\\nwandering.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Inescapable Conclusion</strong>\\n: The data above shows that the lifespans in each period were shorter than\\nthose in the previous period. No one who accepts the inerrancy of Scripture\\nwould dispute this. Thus, beyond question Scripture itself reveals a\\ncontinuing decline of lifespan from the time the Ark survivors left the Ark\\nuntil the day of Moses nearly three millennia later. This progressive\\ndecline is undeniable.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBut the biblical numbers also reveal a second halving of human longevity,\\nthe halving between Eber and Peleg. Scripture records a 225 year difference\\nin the lifespans of Eber and Peleg. A difference of 25 or even 50 years\\nmight be acceptable but a halving, from 450 years for the first three\\ngenerations after the Flood to 236 years for the next three generations\\nafter the Flood is a red flag. Something happened between Eber and Peleg.\\nThat happening was the author of the passage employing the common Hebrew\\nsolution to long lists, he used YLD \\\"to father\\\" in the broad sense rather\\nthan the usual narrow sense of immediate relationship. While following his\\npattern of reporting when each father produced a son, that number refers to\\nthe immediate unnamed son while \\\"to father\\\" is used in the broad sense of a\\ndistant descendant.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSo, it took the most severe act of nature in human history, the Flood, to\\ncut man's longevity from 900 to 450 years. Nowhere do we read of a similar\\nact of nature to cut man's lifespan in half a second time. Thus, this\\nsecond line of argument strengthens the conclusion that this huge span of\\n225 years was not over a single generation; rather, it was the sum of\\ndeclines of many generations skipped between Eber and Peleg. Missing\\ngenerations explains the second halving of human longevity.\\n</p>\\n<h3>\\nGenesis 5 - Omissions in the Line of Adam\\n</h3>\\n<p>\\n<sup>6</sup>\\nWhen Seth had lived 105 years, he fathered Enosh. <sup>7</sup>Seth lived\\nafter he fathered Enosh 807 years and had other sons and daughters.    <sup>8</sup>Thus all the days of Seth were 912 years, and he died. Genesis\\n5:6-8.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nGenesis five records Adam's genealogy, ten names from Adam to Noah. While\\nit is not the subject of this book, it is often discussed along with Shem's\\nlist, so we must add a word about it. If Shem's line in Genesis 11 is\\nexplicit, Adam's line here in Genesis 5 is more so. While Shem's line gives\\nfive details including the years before and after the birth of the son,\\nAdam's list gives those details and totals the years of the father as well.\\nWhy that sixth detail? Merely to establish a pattern? More likely, because\\nof the great ages involved, the writer felt that he needed to total the\\nyears to avoid any misunderstanding.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAs in Shem's line, each of the details in Adam's line is literal. Each\\nnamed person was a real person. He actually lived all the years the passage\\nsays and he fathered a son. Some see in this list the abbreviation of many\\nmillennia. One is the well-known covenant scholar, Meredith Kline who\\ntaught that this Adam list represented more human history than the entire\\ntime since the Flood<a href=\\\"#_ftn2\\\" name=\\\"_ftnref2\\\" title=\\\"\\\">[2]</a>. He\\nobserved that the list contains ten names which raises the suspicion that\\nit is tailored. But his reason for this vast amount of time is that he\\nviews history in terms of divine covenants and according to him Peter\\ndivides history into the world that was, which perished by water, and the\\nworld that now is, which will perish by fire, as stated in II Peter 3:5-7.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nOne of his students, Michael Lawrence, showed this author the printed notes\\nfrom Dr. Kline's class on covenant theology at Gordon-Conwell Theological\\nSeminary. Lawrence had previously earned a bachelor degree at Duke\\nUniversity and following Gordon, continued his education with a Ph.D. in\\nchurch history at Cambridge University, often regarded as one of the most\\nprestigious universities in the world. While he did not agree with Kline's\\nidea of so many years before the Flood, he did give insight into why\\nArchbishop James Ussher felt the lines of Adam and Shem were tight,\\nexhaustive, immediate father-son relationships.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nLawrence explained that Ussher was a Bible scholar who loved the Word of\\nGod and believed in inerrancy. But he was bound by the rigid thinking\\nconcerning genealogies in Great Britain which viewed them as precise, exact\\nand complete. England and Scotland had a combined monarchy. When Queen\\nElizabeth died childless a careful examination of genealogies determined\\nthat James VI of Scotland was the correct successor and he became King\\nJames I of England-Scotland. This selection required careful records for\\nofficials to determine who had the next claim to the throne. Precise\\ngenealogical records gave the answer. To Ussher it was inconceivable that\\ngenealogies could be taken in any other way.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThis was the only way someone living in England-Scotland would ever take\\ngenealogies. Ussher was a product of his culture and brought to the\\nScripture his cultural experience just as all Christians bring to the\\nScripture a framework of assumptions. In this way he made unfounded\\nassumptions about the Biblical genealogies. To him genealogies were all\\nabout a line of succession.    <a href=\\\"#_ftn3\\\" name=\\\"_ftnref3\\\" title=\\\"\\\">[3]</a>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWhile condensation is all but demanded by the enormous drop in longevity\\nbetween Eber and Peleg, no such clue is found in the Adam line. Instead, we\\nfind a growing pattern of sin. \\\"The wickedness of man was great in the\\nearth and...every intention of the thoughts of his heart was only evil\\ncontinually\\\" (Genesis 6:5). Conversely, Enoch walked with the LORD and\\nbecame the first of four successive, unbroken generations-Enoch,\\nMethuselah, Lamech and Noah-so it was exactly 969 years from the birth of\\nhis son Methuselah to the Flood. Further, Seth was the immediate son of\\nAdam. Only four fathers remain who might have represented thousands of\\nomitted years-Enosh, Kenan, Mahalalel and Jared.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nMan's growing sinfulness brought on the Flood. We suggest God's justice\\nrequired Him to terminate generations born into this irreversible\\nsituation. To stop this pattern God limited the number of generations\\nbefore the Flood. Kline failed to grasp the purpose of the Flood-to break\\nthe enslaving straight jacket of sin and restart the human race. While\\nAdam's line does not represent millennia of human history, a few names\\nmight have been omitted to produce precisely ten. Even if two or three were\\nomitted, this would add only 200-300 years to the age of the earth. Kline's\\ncall for a long pre-flood era of many millennia is merely another example\\nof how we all wonder much about the years before the Flood. We take our\\nvarious stabs at them. Yet, they lie not in numbers as much as in\\nunderstanding the mysteries of iniquity and godliness (II Thessalonians 2\\nand I Corinthians 15: 51-58.) Nevertheless, genealogies are a joy, when\\ncorrectly understood, to keep us true to inerrancy and prevent presumption\\nin our interpretations of Scripture.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nOne minor discrepancy in our point that all eight who lived and died before\\nthe Flood lived about 900 years is Lamech who died at the age of 777. The\\nnext greatest deviation from the 900 year average is Methuselah who lived\\nto 969. Methuselah died the year of the Flood, but his son (Lamech) died\\nfive years before the Flood. Very possibly Lamech was the victim of foul\\nplay as attempts grew to silence Noah and his message of judgment. Yet even\\nthis foul play served the purposes of God for it fell on the 777    <sup>th</sup> year of Lamech's life which in numerology has extreme\\nsignificance. Seven represents completion and triple sevens would reflect\\nthe trinity in seeing this total rejection of the Creator. In Book 2 of\\ncreation geologist John Reed's fictional Flood trilogy the Godly who had\\nhelped build the Ark intended to board the Ark but the enemy murdered their\\nentire community.<a href=\\\"#_ftn4\\\" name=\\\"_ftnref4\\\" title=\\\"\\\">[4]</a> Only the\\neight escaped.\\n</p>\\n<h4>\\nWhat Abbreviated Genealogies Teach\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\nTo summarize, a faulty view of biblical genealogies leads to the idea that\\nthe time of the Flood and the creation of man can be calculated within a\\nfew years. This chapter has explained why Hebrew genealogies do not support\\nsuch calculations. It finds overwhelming support that as many as 1300-1900\\nyears elapsed between Eber and Peleg and maybe 200-300 additional years\\nbefore the Flood. This means that whereas many creationists thought that\\nman and living things were created about 6000 years ago, they really were\\ncreated more like 8000 years ago. Thus, we have good reason to be tentative\\nwhere God is silent. But whether 6000 or 8000 or even 10,000 years old,\\nlifeforms on planet earth are still vastly young compared to the billion\\nyear figure of secular science.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSo, this book joins those who find overwhelming biblical and scientific\\nsupport for life on earth being but thousands of years old. However, we\\ntake exception with those who insist that Genesis chapter eleven presents a\\ncomplete father-son list allowing a more exact age calculation. Just one\\nclear abbreviated genealogy would question the idea that Shem's genealogy\\nis complete. This paper presented such an exception in chapter one, the\\nLevi-Aaron list. Chapter six provided many lists where abbreviation is\\ncertain or suspected. We must conclude that it was not God's will for man\\nto be burdened with establishing and defending the age of the earth to\\nwithin a few years. Such an approach is not helpful. It produces divisions\\nwithin and justified criticism without, all of which harm the Kingdom of\\nGod.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe next chapter tackles maybe the greatest disinformation to Shem's\\ngenealogy, that found in the Septuagint.\\n</p>\\n<strong>\\n<br clear=\\\"all\\\"/>\\n</strong>\\n<div>\\n<br clear=\\\"all\\\"/>\\n<hr width=\\\"33%\\\" size=\\\"1\\\" align=\\\"left\\\"/>\\n<div id=\\\"ftn1\\\">\\n    <p>\\n        <a href=\\\"#_ftnref1\\\" name=\\\"_ftn1\\\" title=\\\"\\\">\\n            <sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup>\\n        </a>\\n        Bill Cooper, <em>After the Flood</em> (Chichester, England: New\\n        Wine Press, 1995), 122.\\n    </p>\\n</div>\\n<div id=\\\"ftn2\\\">\\n    <p>\\n        <a href=\\\"#_ftnref2\\\" name=\\\"_ftn2\\\" title=\\\"\\\">\\n            <sup><sup>[2]</sup></sup>\\n        </a>\\n        Meredith Klein, \\\"Kingdom Prologue: Genesis Foundations for a\\n        Covenantal Worldview,\\\" (Hamilton, MA.: Gordon-Conwell Seminary\\n        classroom notes, 1992), 8.\\n    </p>\\n</div>\\n<div id=\\\"ftn3\\\">\\n    <p>\\n        <a href=\\\"#_ftnref3\\\" name=\\\"_ftn3\\\" title=\\\"\\\">\\n            <sup><sup>[3]</sup></sup>\\n        </a>\\n        Michael Lawrence, Senior Pastor, Hinson Baptist Church, Portland,\\n        OR, Interview by the author, 5/19/2015.\\n    </p>\\n</div>\\n<div id=\\\"ftn4\\\">\\n    <p>\\n        <a href=\\\"#_ftnref4\\\" name=\\\"_ftn4\\\" title=\\\"\\\">[4]</a>\\n        John K.

The omission of those generations places the Flood around\\n4000 BC or nearly 1700 years earlier than Archbishop James Ussher\\'s Flood\\ndate. This finding is based on how Scripture itself uses family terms,\\ngenealogies and those numbers given in Genesis five and eleven. A daunting\\nobstacle opposes this view-many Bibles do not contain the same numbers.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nYou read correctly. Those numbers in Shem\\'s list as well as the numbers in\\nAdam\\'s list, used by so many young earth creationists to determine the date\\nof Noah\\'s Flood and creation, are not even found in a majority of the\\nworld\\'s Bibles. They appear in most Protestant Bibles. But Catholic and\\nOrthodox Bibles contain numbers from the Septuagint, a Greek translation of\\nthe Hebrew Old Testament and the adherents of those branches of Christendom\\ngreatly exceed those who use the Protestant Bible-1.6 billion vs 920\\nmillion according to Wikipedia. The begetting year of most fathers in those\\nBibles is increased by 100. Even some knowledgeable creationists argue\\nadamantly for the Septuagint\\'s larger numbers. If we are using wrong\\nnumbers, this book cannot be right.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nTo make matters worse, the Flood itself is viewed as a local event by a\\nsignificant number of godly Bible believing Christians and the six days of\\ncreation as undefined periods of time. Other views also conflict with our\\nmissing 35-55 generations view. While entire books address the many issues\\nexamined in this chapter, we will explain the view and give the fewest\\npossible words in answering it. But be warned, this is a venture into\\nuncharted territory for most inerrancy folks.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nUp front we want to dogmatically state that we believe the Bible of the\\nReformation preserves the correct text. While the Greek<em> Septuagint</em>\\n(<em>LXX</em>) is an excellent translation of its base Hebrew text, the Old\\nTestament was originally written in Hebrew. To some extent a translation\\ncontains interpretations of the translator, so the text of the original\\nlanguage must be preferred. This was the conviction of the Protestant\\nreformers who fought numerous misinterpretations based on the LXX. This is\\nwhy seminaries that train pastors teach the original languages of both the\\nOld and New Testaments. Besides being a translation, the LXX contains 14\\nnon-canonical books, obvious changes from the original and contrived\\nnumbers in the genealogies of Adam and Shem. For these reasons and more, we\\nview the original language text called the <em>Masoretic Text</em> (    <em>MT</em>) to be the correct Old Testament text.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Origin of the Greek Septuagint (LXX)</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nOur story begins by rehearsing how there came to be two major versions of\\nthe Old Testament. In colorful language Flavius Josephus relates that\\nPtolemy II Philadelphus who ruled Egypt from 285 to 246 BC requested of the\\nhigh priest in Jerusalem that a copy of the Torah be translated into Greek\\nand added to his library in Alexandria which had reached 200,000-volumes by\\nthat point. Over time Ptolemy\\'s library became one of the most famous in\\nthe ancient world and it\\'s Greek became the common language of the\\nMediterranean region and Middle East. The Torah contains the first five\\nbooks of the OT written by Moses as God spoke to Israel in the wilderness\\n(1446-1406 BC). Ptolemy\\'s request was nearly 1200 years later, about 250\\nBC. Jerusalem sent 72 elders to Alexandria where they quickly made the\\ntranslation. Because just over 70 Jews were involved, their translation was\\ncalled the<em> Septuagint</em>, the Greek word for 70.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nA second story dates the LXX to about 280 BC. While only 30 years separate\\nthe two dates, the Word of God requires accuracy and truth. Evidence favors\\nthe 250 date but the 280 date is advanced by those who argue for the LXX\\nnumbers and therefore is important to the question of which text contains\\nthe correct numbers. This controversy is explored in much detail in\\nAppendix 8.3.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe original Septuagint contained just the five books of Moses-Genesis,\\nExodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy. This is extremely important\\nbecause over hundreds of years many more books were added to it, yet the\\ngrowing collection continued to be called the \"<em>Septuagint</em>.\" First,\\nby fits and starts during the next 150 years the remainder of the Hebrew\\nBible was translated into the Greek by possibly four generations of\\ntranslators and became a part of the Septuagint. This was the OT often\\ncited in the NT. Then, as the church age progressed more and more\\nnon-canonical books were added to it. This much larger collection is what\\nthe words \"<em>Septuagint</em>\" and \"<em>LXX</em>\" refer to today.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Aramaic Replaces Hebrew</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAn impressive argument for the LXX numbers is that they are supported by\\n400 years of historians including Demetrius, Eupolemus, Philo and Josephus\\nbefore the first known mention of the MT numbers. This MT silent period\\nlasted from the beginning of the LXX translation to the alleged Jewish\\ndeflation of the birthing numbers after 70 AD. However, it happened as\\nHebrew underwent a transformation in Israel. With the destruction of Israel\\nand the Babylonian Captivity, nearby peoples replaced the Jewish\\npopulation. As Jews slowly returned after the prophesied 70 years of exile,\\nthey became mixed with this new population, some of whom spoke a\\nsignificant regional Semitic language called Aramaic (from Aram, one of\\nShem\\'s five sons). As Aramaic words entered the Jews\\' Hebrew language,\\ntheir distinctive Hebrew tongue eventually came to be replaced by Aramaic.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBy Jesus\\' day Aramaic, not Hebrew, was the everyday language spoken in\\nIsrael. Possibly only several hundred thousand Jews could even understand\\nbiblical Hebrew. To get along as a conquered people, many Jews in Israel\\nalso spoke the international language, the Koine Greek. Scholars debate\\njust how much the average Jew of that day used or even understood Biblical\\nHebrew although the Hebrew OT did continue to be used by Jews in Temple\\nfunctions, scholarly debates, public teaching and readings in local\\nsynagogues. Nevertheless, that Hebrew OT was the official OT text of\\nJudaism and in coming centuries came to be known as the    <em>Masoretic Text</em> (<em>MT</em>).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nJust before His ascension Jesus told his disciples \"You will be my\\nwitnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the\\nearth\" (Acts 1:8). As the church reached further and further from\\nJerusalem, it needed to speak in a language the world understood. That\\nlanguage was not Aramaic or biblical Hebrew. It was the Koine Greek. The\\nearly disciples witnessed from the Greek Old Testament, the LXX. Thus, the    <em>LXX</em> became the commonly used OT Bible of the NT Church while the\\nbooks of the NT all came to be preserved if not written in that same Greek\\nlanguage and remain so to this day. Fifteen hundred years later leaders of\\nthe Protestant Reformation returned to the Hebrew MT believing it was the\\ntrue OT.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nNecessity, therefore, forced the use of the Greek LXX, but the Dead Sea\\nScrolls (DSS) prove beyond doubt that the MT all along was the preferred\\nJewish text. The next pages will explain why their existence is among the\\ntop reasons <em>Hidden Beauty</em> believes the MT, not the LXX contains\\nthe true birthing numbers in the Genesis five and eleven genealogies.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nContinuing, we also learn from this so-called period of silence the\\npriority of God. He was vastly more concerned with getting out the Gospel\\nthan establishing the dates for the Flood and creation. In fact, those\\ndates were so unimportant to God that they are never given in all of\\nScripture. Suggesting that a written summation of the Genesis five and\\neleven numbers is unnecessary and the reader can add those two sets of\\nbirthing ages in his head while reading the text defies about every rule of\\nwriting. This is doubly certain in view of the summation of each birthing\\nand remaining number in the Genesis five list. Nine times Scripture gives\\nthe birthing number, the remaining years and sums those two numbers.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nClearly, by summing those two numbers nine times, the author shows they\\nwere meant to be summed while the absence of a summation of the nineteen\\nbirthing numbers shows they were not meant to be summed. Such minor issues\\nas the dates of the Flood and creation could wait until they needed to be\\naddressed. But Jesus commanded the apostles to devote their attention to\\nannouncing the good news that \"God so loved the world that he gave his only\\nson, that whoever believes on him should not perish but have eternal life\"\\n(John 3:16).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIn addition to the two major Pentateuchal texts-the Masoretic Text in\\nHebrew and the original Septuagint in Koine Greek-the Samaritans had their\\nown version. When they separated from Judah following Solomon\\'s reign, the\\ngodly among them honored Moses and lived by the Pentateuch. Nevertheless,\\nthe ungodly leaders made major changes such as changing certain commands\\nrelated to worshipping in Jerusalem so that they could live as a separate\\nkingdom. It was written in Hebrew using the Samaritan alphabet. It is\\ncalled the <em>Samaritan Pentateuch</em> (<em>SP</em>) and is helpful to\\ntextual scholars as they study verses in the Books of Moses. However, after\\nthe captivity it lost its significance and by the days of Jesus and the\\nApostles, the <em>MT</em> and <em>LXX</em> were the primary OTs used.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Differences between the MT and the LXX</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThere are tens of thousands of differences between the MT and the canonical\\nOT LXX books. Many are merely matters of breathing, pronunciation,\\nspelling, etc. The <em>Torah</em> is the most similar in the two versions\\nwhile substantial differences are found in some of the other books such as\\nJeremiah and Daniel. Our concern is the numbers in Shem\\'s genealogy which\\nmost creationists sum to calculate the date of the Flood. If those numbers\\nare wrong, we are beating a dead horse and Ussher\\'s date for the Flood is\\nwrong as well.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAstonishingly all but the key numbers differ in the Genesis five and eleven\\nlists as authority Dr. Pete Williams wrote in a 1998    <em>Journal of Creation</em> article. Further, the LXX contains one more\\nname than the MT. In a spreadsheet Williams displayed side by side the\\nyears given in the three OT Pentateuch texts for Genesis five and eleven.    <a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\" title=\"\">[1]</a> This involves a whopping\\n146 numbers. (See Appendix, Tables 8.1 and 8.2.) In fact, of 20 names only\\nthe numbers of Noah and Shem agree in all three texts. Beyond mere\\ndisagreements of certain numbers, twelve fathers were 100 years older when\\ntheir heir was born according to the LXX. The LXX numbers also provides a\\ngradual decline of human longevity.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nMany creationists prefer the larger numbers and several dogmatically defend\\nthem. They charge that the birthing ages in the two genealogies were\\ndeliberately and systematically deflated after 70 AD in the MT while the\\nLXX numbers are mostly the correct numbers. They add that they are not\\nalone, that others who believe in the inerrancy of Scripture also maintain\\nthat the MT numbers were deflated. On the other hand, Williams says that\\nboth \"the Septuagint and the Samaritan Pentateuch show evidence of\\nsystematic schematisation [British] within themselves.\" Is Williams a lone\\nvoice? No. Numbers specialists have studied and compared the three\\ndifferent manuscripts of these two passages. In noting the specific numbers\\nand their patterns they conclude that the <em>LXX</em> numbers are\\nartificial and obviously manipulated-devised, not natural.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWhy would specialists in the field of number patterns stamp the LXX numbers\\nas artificial and manipulated? Here are three reasons and undoubtedly there\\nare more. First, the birthing numbers in the LXX are uncannily similar to\\neach other. From Cainan to Lamach they read 170, 165, 162, 165 and 167. The\\nodds of five consecutive generations giving birth to their heirs so close\\nto the same age is great. Because the MT numbers are 100 years less, they\\nare spread out about four times compared with the LXX and do not raise red\\nflags to numbers specialists. The Shem list, though, is a scandal. The LXX\\ngives the following birthing ages for the first seven (including the extra\\nname in the LXX list) named fathers born in his line after the Flood: 135,\\n130, 130, 134, 130, 132, 130. The odds of such similar birthing ages are\\nastronomical. Second, the LXX numbers show a consistent decline in\\nlongevity after the Flood with one exception. While this is extremely\\nsatisfying to the secular mind, it is a stretch statistically.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThirdly, the LXX Shem birthing numbers show an artificial pattern when\\ncalculated as a percentage of total lifespan. This observation is not\\napparent on the surface, but stands out when one divides the birthing age\\nby the total age. For example, Arpachshad was 135 when he fathered the next\\ngeneration. Divide 135 by his lifespan of 438. The answer, 23.9%, tells how\\nfar he was into his total years when he fathered the next generation. The\\nfirst four names (Arpachshad, Cainan, Shelah and Eber) show these\\npercentages: <a name=\"_Hlk85366964\">23.9%, 28.3%, 28.3% and 26.6% </a>and\\nthis in spite of LXX adjustments in total ages to show gradual reduction in\\nlongevity. The next four names show these percentages: 38.3%, 38.9%, 39.4%\\nand 38.0% in spite of an increase in Nahor\\'s longevity. The artificial\\nnature of these numbers is obvious-four consecutive names with percentages\\nbetween 23.9% and 28.3% and the very next four names with percentages\\nbetween 38.0% and 39.4%.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIf using today\\'s average lifespan of 70 years, these numbers would read\\n16.7%, 19.8%, 19.8% and 18.6% for the first four names and 26.8%, 27.3%,\\n27.6% and 23.9% for the second four names. By comparison the MT percentages\\nare 8.0%, 6.9% and 7.3% for the three names and 12.6%, 13.4% and 13.0% for\\nthe next three. This is consistent with the contention of this book that\\nfollowing the first three names is a gap of 35-55 generations. The MT\\nbirthing numbers show that the first generations after the Flood obeyed\\nGod\\'s command to \"be fruitful and multiply\" (Genesis 9:7) by having\\nchildren as soon as they were physically capable while the LXX numbers\\ndon\\'t show such urgency (23.9%, 28.3%, 28.3% and 26.6%). The very numbers\\nof the LXX are sufficient reason to reject them.\\n</p>\\n<p align=\"center\">\\n<strong>The Dead Sea Scrolls</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBut the very best evidence, however, to uphold the MT as the correct OT\\ntext is the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls (DSS). Those who weigh the MT\\nvs the LXX must understand these scrolls so <em>Hidden Beauty</em> devotes\\nmany pages to their content, the Qumran community and distortions by\\nsensationalists. See Appendix 8.4 - 8.6. In 1947 Bedouin youths looking for\\nlost sheep stumbled across several parchments in a cave near the Dead Sea.\\nThey were identified as legitimate ancient documents and soon the search\\nwas on for more. Over eight years searchers found 900 scrolls and uncounted\\nfragments, mostly in Hebrew and written on parchment. They were hidden in\\neleven caves in the cliffs close to an ancient two-building settlement\\ncalled Qumran that looked down on the NW corner of the Dead Sea. The\\nfragile pieces of parchment had been preserved by the hot, dry desert\\nclimate and the darkness of the caves. This discovery is variously called\\nthe greatest archaeological event of the 20<sup>th</sup> century and the\\ngreatest finding of ancient documents of all time.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSearchers found fragments of every book of the OT except Esther. Textual\\nscholars began studying the manuscripts as soon as they realized the\\nscrolls were genuine and have been studying them ever since. A growing list\\nof insights have developed over the intervening 70 years of study and the\\nmore recent discovery of scrolls at six other Judean Desert locations.\\nSeven hundred of the original scrolls are non-biblical sacred writings.\\nThey give a new understanding of the religious life of Israel during this\\nperiod. But <em>HB</em> is exploring the question of whether the LXX or MT\\nis the true OT so it will focus on the 200 plus biblical scrolls as well as\\nmore recent biblical discoveries. First, early impressions will be\\nreported. Then the more accurate current understanding is related.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe scholars quickly realized that not all the texts read alike. Yes, many\\nof them did read like the earliest already-existing MTs, but some of them\\nread like the earliest LXX texts. Further, some did not read like either.\\nThey were sorted into piles that were similar. Eventually they had five\\ngroups-those similar to the MT, those similar to the LXX, those similar to\\nthe Samaritan Pentateuch, a fourth similar group and finally those that fit\\nnone of the four piles. What an eye-opener. Before, the thinking was that\\nthere was just a single text of the Hebrew Old Testament and copies of it\\nhad more or fewer mistakes depending on the diligence of the scribe. Now it\\nwas apparent that multiple Hebrew OT texts had come into existence over the\\ncenturies.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIn studying the base Hebrew texts used to translate the LXX, the scholars\\ndiscovered that the LXX was a good translation, that it faithfully\\ntranslated the Hebrew text that it was based on. As a result, the LXX has\\nbeen declared an excellent and trustworthy translation of its source Hebrew\\ntexts. Some of the remarkable evidence for its accuracy will be addressed\\nlater.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe presence of different families of OT texts at Qumran means the 70 who\\ntranslated the Hebrew Bible into Greek had multiple Hebrew texts to choose\\nfrom. They did not have to change any birthing numbers in the genealogies\\nof Adam and Shem. Those numbers already existed in the text they selected\\nto translate into Greek. The argument that the LXX numbers are right while\\nthe MT numbers have been changed doesn\\'t fit the finding of multiple Hebrew\\nOT text families found at Qumran.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe existence of these multiple textual families led to further\\nobservations. Differences in the texts did not seem to trouble the\\nQumranian scribes. They carefully copied the texts they procured, even\\nobvious mistakes. This showed the care with which the scribes did their\\ncopying. The two previous oldest Masoretic Texts were the Aleppo Codex of\\n930 AD and the Leningrad Codex of 1050 AD. They are almost identical to\\neach other. Now the DSS discovery brought to light scrolls that existed a\\nthousand years before and they were remarkably similar to those two\\nmedieval texts. One scroll is the complete book of Isaiah. It is amazingly\\nclose to Isaiah in the previous oldest copy of the MT, the Aleppo Codex.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nHowever, the birthing years in Genesis five and eleven is the issue before\\nus. With several exceptions the scrolls are not complete OT books but\\nrather portions of OT books, chapters and even compilations of verses from\\nvarious books. None contain any of the birthing years of Genesis five and\\neleven so that is not our argument. Rather, they consistently show that the\\nScriptures regardless of textual family were carefully and faithfully\\ncopied during the time when Israel was shifting from Hebrew to Aramaic.\\nThus, the DSS prove that the charge that Jews made extensive changes to the\\nMT in the second century A.D. is false.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe birthing numbers were changed sometime before the translation into\\nGreek. So, when the Jews translated their Torah for Ptolemy\\'s library, they\\nhad multiple texts to choose from and to avoid offending the Egyptians\\nchose a text that had the larger numbers. Toward the end of this chapter,\\nwe will describe the development of the OT canon and suggest those birthing\\nnumbers were most likely changed well before 250 BC.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>More Recent Insights</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIn 2016 newly developed computer imaging was able to read a charred Hebrew\\nscroll from an ancient synagogue at Engedi dated c. 200 AD. The scroll\\nconsisted of Leviticus chapters one and two. The words in it were identical\\nto the earliest existing Hebrew copy of Leviticus 1-2. Emanuel Tov, who\\ncoordinated the work of 98 scholars during his years as editor-in-chief of\\nthe 40 volume DSS publishing project from 1991 to 2009, exclaimed, \"We have\\nnever found something as striking as this. This is the earliest evidence of\\nthe exact form of the medieval text [earliest previously existing MTs, the\\nAleppo and Leningrad Codices].\"    <a href=\"#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\" title=\"\">[2]</a> Biblical scrolls found at\\nfive other Judean Desert locations are like the Engedi Leviticus scroll.\\nThey are identical (or nearly identical) to the MT. They were carried by\\nthose fleeing the Romans during the Jewish revolts of 67 and 132 AD and\\nrepresent Jewish national circles that adhered only to the MT.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nMore careful examination of the Qumran scrolls since 1990 reveals that the\\nPentateuchal ones were likewise close to the MT while the texts of other OT\\nbooks were more like other textual families. In a 17-page article Emanuel\\nTov, explains what was going on.    <a href=\"#_ftn3\" name=\"_ftnref3\" title=\"\">[3]</a> The goal of the Qumran\\ncommunity was to keep the Mosaic Law as perfectly as humanly possible. In\\nthis effort they interpreted the requirements of the law more strictly than\\nthe priesthood in Jerusalem and viewed themselves as the true Israel. They\\nwere opposing the wicked priest (presumably the Levitical officials at\\nJerusalem) and even observed a different calendar than the temple\\nleadership. They wrote the 700 non-biblical sacred texts in their efforts\\nto accomplish their goal. So while they stayed close to the Pentateuchal MT\\nin their effort to fully keep the law, they practiced greater freedom in\\nthe other OT books, showing their freedom from the religious establishment\\nin Jerusalem.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThose loyal to the Jerusalem priesthood fled the Roman war machine but did\\nnot take their scrolls to Qumran. Instead, they hid out in other Judean\\nDesert locations. The Qumran scrolls represent various religious movements\\nin Israel that identified with the Qumran goal. As a result, on the one\\nhand scrolls exist that are identical or nearly identical to the MT\\nPentateuch which shows the great care given the MT. On the other hand, the\\nexistence of multiple textual families shows beyond question that these\\ndifferent textual families were well known in Israel and had a long\\nhistory.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nTov also wrote an article on the numbers problem in the three major\\nPentateuchs. He concluded that the differences are recensional, not\\nscribal.<a href=\"#_ftn4\" name=\"_ftnref4\" title=\"\">[4]</a> He believes that\\nthe Hebrew base text for the LXX and Samaritan Pentateuch developed as one\\ntext and were later separated. He also views the LXX numbers as obviously\\ncontrived.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nNow, for another shocker. The textual scholars have studied OT quotes in\\nthe New Testament. It turns out the NT authors cited verses from various OT\\ntextual families. Tov observed that the Apostle Paul used currently\\nrecognized different Greek textual families for the same biblical book\\n(Isaiah) and apparently under the same conditions in the same epistle\\n(Romans). Paul, it appears, used whatever text was available wherever he\\nhappened to be. This shows that God\\'s focus is the message, not the exact\\nwording.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nTo all the DSS evidence for the careful handling of Scripture, two\\nunfortunate responses are found. Most creationists dismiss them. In fact,\\nmost have not even heard much about them. But those who have say the people\\nwho lived in the tiny settlement of Qumran in the midst of the 11 Dead Sea\\ncaves and collected and copied the scrolls are insignificant, unimportant.\\nUnbelievers go even further, identifying them as heretics-Essenes. The\\nEssenes had their own agenda. They mixed Judaism with heathen beliefs from\\nancient Eastern religions. They conclude that possibly Jesus got His ideas\\nfrom them. In contrast, creationists conclude: they were not a part of true\\nIsrael; their scrolls prove nothing about God; mystery and confusion\\nsurround them; we have better things to do with our time.\\n</p>\\n<p align=\"center\">\\n<strong>Thirteen Reasons to Prefer the Masoretic Text Numbers</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nA plethora of misinformation underlies the thinking of those who prefer the\\nLXX numbers. Our first eight reasons for rejecting these arguments have\\nalready been explained. First and foremost is that the DSS have a strong\\npreference for the MT. Second, the LXX translators had multiple Hebrew\\ntexts to choose from and chose the textual family with the larger numbers.\\nThird, the LXX numbers are obviously manipulated. Fourth, the changing of\\nlanguages in Israel and growing dependance on the LXX explains why the LXX\\nbirthing numbers predominantly show up in historical records. Fifth, God\\'s\\nclear priority was to get out the Gospel, not clarify minor issues such as\\nthe dates of the Flood and creation.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSixth, the purpose of the numbers: most creationists say they were given to\\nestablish a chronology of early earth history. This argument was addressed\\nat length in chapter one (pp 17-19). It quotes a conservative Hebrew\\nscholar who offered possible non-chronology purposes for those numbers. He\\nspecifically stated that \"The major arguments they use (for the\\nchrono-genealogical view) are defective and falsifiable.\" Arguments seven\\nand eight are major subjects of this book-the common Hebrew practice of\\ncondensing genealogies and the huge decline of longevity between Eber and\\nPeleg in the MT. (These two arguments dissolve if the LXX numbers are\\ncorrect. The LXX numbers contain no enormous decline in longevity between\\ntwo generations.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe remaining arguments have not been previously mentioned. Nine. This\\nargument involves a complicated grammatical issue regarding the form of the\\nHebrew verb \"beget\" in the Genesis five and eleven lists. Hebrew verbs do\\nnot have tenses. While English verbs have tenses which tell about the\\n\"when\" of the action, Hebrew verbs have seven possible stems which tell the\\ntype of action of the verb. One of the challenges to the new Hebrew student\\nis learning all the forms of those stems for the same verb.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe Hebrew verb for beget (YALAD) is in the hiphil stem in Genesis five and\\neleven. It is used consistently for a total of 55 times. Those not seasoned\\nin Hebrew might translate the hiphil of YALAD with \"he had\" or \"he brought\\nforth to birth.\" With this rendering of YALAD the student might conclude\\nthat because of this, the age of the father when the named son was born\\nestablishes a chronology. He might conclude that though names may be\\nomitted, the chronology remains unchanged. With this thinking he would sum\\nthe Shem list birthing ages found in the LXX and confidently conclude that\\nthe Flood occurred around 3300 BC. By adding the numbers in Adam\\'s list, he\\nwould place creation around 5560 BC. Thus, the Hebrew student would\\nconclude that the Hebrew grammatical structure prohibits omitting\\ngenerations.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe fact is that the hiphil stem indicates <strong>causative</strong>\\naction. While the basic qal stem would be sufficient for \"he had\" or \"he\\nbrought forth to birth,\" the hiphil stem has greater force. It says \"A\"\\ntook an action that <strong>caused</strong> the birth of generation \"B.\" If\\na generation \"C\" followed, \"A\\'s\" action, in effect, caused that birth as\\nwell. In fact, regardless of how many generations followed \"B,\" \"A\\'s\"\\naction caused that chain. All descendants of \"A\" were caused by that action\\n(even though the actions of descendants were necessary as well). But the\\nwriter felt the need to record when \"A\" took that action. This is where the\\nconfusion arises. The offspring\\'s name is mistakenly linked to this age.\\nWhen that happens, the reader establishes a chronology. But \"A\\'s\" age was\\nwhen he took this action and his immediate son was born. The named son\\ncould be the immediate son or any descendant down the line. It was the\\nchoice of the author to name the one in the line he wanted to feature.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIf the author had wished to emphasize that the son was born in the normal\\nprocess of nature, the stem indicating <strong>intensive</strong> action,\\nthe piel stem, would have been used. That would be saying that \"A\" did not\\nadopt \"B\" or buy him as a slave or procure him in some other way, but he\\nacquired him by <strong>begetting</strong> him. But neither the qal nor\\npiel stems were selected. The author chose the stem that emphasizes    <strong>causation</strong> and he did this repeatedly. So, the passage\\nemphasizes that the father\\'s action caused the births of all who resulted\\nfrom his action. If the author named \"C\" rather than \"B,\" he would be\\nskipping one generation. If he named \"G\" rather than \"B,\" he would be\\nskipping B, C, D, E and F-five generations. Thus, the hiphil does not\\nintroduce a chronology. Because of the hiphil, those from Green to Unger\\nwho taught Hebrew for a lifetime knew they were on solid ground when they\\nstated that names were omitted in the lists.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBelievers who subscribe to the inerrancy of Scripture are to be commended\\nas they try to take the literal meaning of the words their translations\\nuse. But since the Hebrew verb form can, to some extent, be lost in the\\ntranslation, Scripture must be read with care. To this extent those who\\nread a translation of the Hebrew are dependent on Hebrew scholars. Why four\\nparagraphs on the hiphil not supporting the chronological argument? It is\\nbecause creationists have been inundated with articles on Genesis five and\\neleven being chronologies. Those lists are even given a special\\nname-chronogenealogies. In effect, those well read in creationist\\nliterature have been brainwashed as this idea has been repeated over and\\nover so it could take multiple explanations using different words to plant\\nthe correct meaning in their minds.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nTen. The DSS are first hand documents in existence today. Conversely, the\\nactual texts of many of the various external witnesses to the LXX numbers\\nduring the 400 silent years such as Demetrius, Eupolemus and Philo are not\\navailable for independent verification. They cannot be checked to determine\\nif their statements are consistent, in proper context and not somehow\\ncompromised. Rules of evidence prefer a physical document to a report of a\\ndocument.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nEleven. Josephus is cited as a key historical witness to the LXX birthing\\nnumbers but his testimony is questionable. He declared that everything he\\nwrote came straight from the Jews sacred books and that he accessed the\\noriginal Hebrew documents. Yet he was in Rome and under Flavian patronage\\nwhen he wrote all of his known works. Josephus scholars universally decry\\nhis liberties with the facts. He elaborated at will and changed obvious\\nfacts to entertain and not offend his readers. For instance, in relating\\nabout Abraham in Genesis 11 and 20, he says Abraham and Nahor married their\\ncousins, the daughters of their brother Haran. When Abimelech confronted\\nAbraham about Sarah being his wife, Josephus wrote that Abraham said she\\nwas his cousin even though the LXX says \"Sarah is the daughter of my\\nfather, but not the daughter of my mother.\" Without question he would\\ndefinitely have reported the greater LXX birthing numbers as the MT numbers\\nwould have insulted the intelligence of his readers.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBehind the personage was a character. Here are the facts. He was a Jewish\\ngeneral in Galilee leading a revolt against the Romans. He was defeated and\\ntaken prisoner. That should have been the end, but Josephus had a secret\\nweapon, words. With words he made the Romans and Greeks love him. The way\\nhe wrote delighted them. He even wrote they all worshipped the same god.\\nVarious people used different names. The Greeks called him Zeus.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIn addition to Josephus\\' known penchant to elaborate at will, his LXX list\\ndoes not include the second Cainan. He writes that from Adam to Moses were\\nten fathers and from Shem to Abraham were ten fathers so he leaves out the\\nsecond Cainan. This is extremely damaging to his testimony. In fact, it\\npretty much disqualifies his witness to the LXX numbers. It indicates that\\nhe had no Hebrew text or if he did, it did not contain the second Cainan,\\nor he wanted to delight his audience with exactly ten names in each list.\\nSince the second Cainan is in today\\'s LXX, one must wonder just how\\nreliable his copy of the LXX was or how reliable today\\'s copy is. He also\\ngave three or four different numbers from today\\'s LXX. While Josephus is\\ncited as a leading ancient historian to the LXX numbers, if a leading\\nwitness is so defective, how certain can we be about the others?\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nTwelve. Jerome (345-420 AD) testified to seeing the actual Hebrew texts in\\nJerusalem. This man was a true scholar in Latin, Hebrew and Greek. He\\ntranslated the Latin Vulgate directly from the Hebrew. Even though he is\\ndated to the late 4<sup>th</sup> century AD, he would have carefully\\ninvestigated any tales of Jewish officials deflating the numbers after 70\\nAD and he would not have selected the MT numbers unless he was convinced\\nthey were correct. Jerome is a strong witness to the MT numbers.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThirteen. Argument from the Book of Jubilees (BOJ). The BOJ (c. 150-160 BC)\\ndeclares that 50 Jubilees occurring from Creation to Joshua\\'s conquests,\\n2500 years. To do so it changed some MT birthing years in the two lists to\\ntotal that number but its first five birthing numbers are the same as those\\nin the MT and the sixth is different by just one year. LXX advocates say\\nthat the MT numbers were copied from the BOJ and since the BOJ numbers are\\nunreliable, the MT numbers are also unreliable.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nScholars agree that the BOJ numbers were contrived to produce fifty\\njubilees. Still, God\\'s law regarding sabbath years lay deep in the souls of\\nHis people. They were to do no work and let the land rest on the seventh\\nyear. After observing seven sabbatical years they were to observe a super\\nsabbatical year on the fiftieth year. So, the numbers seven, 49 and 50 were\\nvery powerful and pleasing to the Jewish mind. Is it not possible that some\\noverzealous Jew began thinking about those begetting numbers in the MT and\\nby changing some could more establish Israel\\'s early history from them with\\ngreater certainty? He could use the first numbers because they were small\\nand would give his idea credibility. In fact, he would only have to change\\na half dozen of the 19 MT numbers to achieve his goal. This could explain\\nhow the BOJ came to be written.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nMore importantly, the MT numbers existed well over a thousand years before\\nthe BOJ numbers. So, the argument using the BOJ as the source for the MT\\nnumbers is backwards. The BOJ got many of its numbers from the existing MT.\\nFurther, while the BOJ drew considerable attention at both Qumran and\\nJerusalem, it was never declared authoritative in either place.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nA baker\\'s dozen of arguments have been given preferring the MT birthing\\nnumbers in Genesis five and eleven. These arguments will be challenged by\\ngodly believers. Some of our thirteen arguments may even be incorrect. For\\ninstance, the Josephus argument may be blamed on scribal errors and the\\nexternal witness argument may be challenged. But no one can dismiss most of\\nthe others such as the arguments from the DSS and the pattern of the LXX\\nnumbers. Consequently, the inescapable conclusion is that MT numbers are\\ncorrect and the LXX numbers are artificial.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nHowever, some advance a fourteenth argument for the MT numbers. They claim\\nthat God promised to preserve the Scripture\\'s original text. They cite such\\nverses as Psalm 12:7, Luke 16:17, Romans 12:1-2, and Jude 1:3 for this\\nclaim. This is so surprising that we must repeat: one highly visible Ph.D.\\ncreationist (and his followers) in effect says God has promised to preserve\\nthe original autographs. But this is not what those verses are saying.\\nRather, they concern the fulfillment of what God has promised, not the text\\nin which He promised it. Jesus indicated clearly that God will fulfill all\\nHe has said in Matthew 5:18: \"Until heaven and earth pass away, not an\\niota, not a dot, will pass from the Law until all is accomplished.\"\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe idea that God has promised to preserve the original text sends the\\nblood pressure of scholars who have spent lifetimes studying the various\\ntexts and therefore know of thousands of differences in them through the\\nceiling. It brings utter scorn on all who hold it. As we have said\\nrepeatedly, the original autographs were lost long ago. Errors have entered\\ninto the text(s) that we have today. Thus, we must compare Scripture with\\nScripture to get the clearest and best meaning. Creationists need to\\nseparate themselves from this unbiblical teaching.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThose who prefer the LXX birthing numbers do so because they are persuaded\\nthat the Flood and creation occurred earlier than Ussher\\'s dates and the\\nLXX accommodates them with earlier Flood and creation dates.    <em>Hidden Beauty</em> also came into existence because it seemed that\\ncivilization was going strong at the time of Ussher\\'s Flood date. But    <em>HB</em> limited its search to the Scriptures and drew its conclusions\\nfrom the common and frequent practices within the Hebrew text. Defending\\nthe larger LXX numbers is certainly zeal for God, but wouldn\\'t it be better\\nto stand on the common practices of Scripture which uses family terms\\nbroadly and condenses genealogies?\\n</p>\\n<p align=\"center\">\\n<strong>Other Views Needing Fine Tuning </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>The Local Flood View</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBelievers exposed to the early pronouncements from the budding science of\\ngeology saw their precious Bible vilified via Noah\\'s Flood. While the Flood\\nis the greatest geological event spoken of since creation, it is a\\nreligious story and thus a tempting target for scoffers. And that is what\\nhappened. Early geologists unmercifully ridiculed the biblical Flood story.\\nThose who love Jesus searched for an answer. They noticed that the words\\nScripture uses for the Flood are employed in different senses throughout\\nthe Bible and began to defend it by reasoning that Scripture was using\\nwords like \"all,\" \"every\" and \"on the earth\" in a limited sense. They\\nsuggested the Flood may have occurred where a sea like the Black Sea exists\\ntoday or possibly the Flood wiped out a large population in a region like\\nthe Tigris-Euphrates River basin.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nGeologists have learned much since the days of Charles Lyell, the father of\\ngeology. Now they know of entire systems or masses of magma that rise like\\nplumes or trees all the way from the lower mantle to the surface of the\\nearth. One is under the Indian Ocean. Another is under an area greater than\\nEthiopia. \"All the fountains of the great deep burst forth\" (Genesis 7:11)\\nno longer sounds that far-fetched. Geologists know that the crust of the\\nearth up to ten miles down is layered with fossil-bearing, water-deposited\\nmaterial and hardened flows of magma. These layers can be traced for\\nthousands of miles and give evidence of immediate deposit. Vast amounts of\\nphysical evidence in the earth\\'s surface layers confirm a global flood.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nHowever, believers should look to Scripture as the final authority, not\\nScripture as interpreted by some human authority. Scripture itself uses an\\noverwhelming number of terms commonly understood in a global, world-wide\\nsense in speaking of the Flood:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n-Of the wickedness of man and judgment on all humans outside the ark:\\nGenesis 6:3, 5, 5, 6, 7, 11, 11, 12, 12, 13, 13, 13, 17, 19, 19, 20, 20;\\n7:4, 11, 11, 21, 22, 23 (23 times);\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n-Of the death of all land animals except those on the ark: Genesis 6:19,\\n20; 7:3, 14, 14, 14, 15, 16, 21, 22, 23, 23, 23, 23 (14 times);\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n-Of the waters increasing/prevailing: Genesis 7:16, 18, 19, 19, 20, 20, 24\\n(7 times);\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n-Of the subsiding of the waters and the exiting of the Ark: Genesis 8:1, 1,\\n2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 17, 17, 18, 19, 19, 19, 19 (22\\ntimes);\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n-Of God\\'s command to fill the earth and His promise not to destroy all\\nflesh by another flood: Genesis 8:21, 21, 22; 9:1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 7, 7,\\n10, 10, 10, 11, 11, 12, 12, 13, 14, 15, 15, 16, 16, 17, 19, 10:32 (28\\ntimes).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nA dozen all-encompassing terms such as \"all flesh\" might be tolerable in\\ndescribing a devastating flood of limited geographical area. But Scripture\\nuses such terms 80-90 times as it describes a flood that blotted out all\\nland-dwelling life. Similarly, a chapter might suffice to describe a local\\nflood, but Scripture devotes five chapters to this flood. Five chapters is\\nequal to all the Scripture that comes before-both the creation account and\\nall pre-Flood history.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe rest of the Bible continues this global view of the Flood. Thousands of\\nyears later, God said, \"I swore that the waters of Noah should no more go\\nover the earth\" (Isaiah 54:9). God says that just as He has kept that oath,\\nso He will also keep His oath to love Israel. Jesus said \"the Flood\\ndestroyed them all\" (cited in two Gospels: Matthew 24:39; Luke 17:27).\\nPeter reasons of the certainty of future judgment by using the Flood as an\\nexample: \"if (God) did not spare the ancient world&#8230;when he brought a\\nflood upon the world of the ungodly&#8230;\" (II Peter 2:5). Later Peter\\ndivides time into two epochs: \"the world that then existed was deluged with\\nwater and perished, but&#8230;the heavens and earth that now exist are\\nstored up for fire&#8230;,\" i.e., then&#8230;now, (II Peter 3:6-7).\\nScripture abounds with statements to the effect that the Flood was global.\\nAs to human authorities, Merrill F. Unger, a modern prince of biblical\\nHebrew, wrote in his Bible dictionary, page 372, \"In the Genesis account\\nnothing short of a globe-encircling catastrophe is indicated.\"\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIn addition to the constant use of inclusive nouns and adjectives in the\\nFlood account, nine major features of the Flood story support a global\\nevent-Satanic activity, design of the Ark, the years provided to build it,\\nthe duration of the Flood, the character of Noah, pre-flood geography,\\npermission to eat animal flesh, the rainbow and repopulating the world. The\\nFlood record begins with a brief but chilling and mysterious account of\\nSatanic activity that worked to corrupt mankind and thus destroy God\\'s plan\\nfor man. Commentators generally overlook Satan as the cause of the\\nexplosion of human wickedness that required radical surgery, yet that is\\nthe Scriptural explanation (Genesis 6:1-4) that begins five chapters on the\\nFlood and the repopulation of the earth.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe Ark was remarkably suited to enable the survival of its passengers. It\\nwas the largest vessel built until modern times, yet its dimensions were as\\nsound as today\\'s ship design. How is that possible? God, not Noah,\\nspecified the dimensions of the Ark. God designed the Ark to float and hold\\na maximum of cargo, not travel to some destination. Basically, it was a\\nrectangular box which would head into the wind to prevent capsizing. If the\\nflood was local, there would be no need for a ship at all. God could simply\\ndirect the Noah party out of the danger zone. But the Ark was an\\nocean-going vessel for a worldwide flood.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBecause of the wickedness of man God determined to destroy all flesh in 120\\nyears (Genesis 6:3). If the flood was local, this would give Noah enough\\ntime to make a hundred trips to the safe zone, even if it were a thousand\\nmiles away. But if the flood were to be all encompassing, Noah would need\\nhelpers and this is exactly what happened. After the 120-year warning God\\ngave him three sons. But Noah would also have to learn the craft of ship\\nbuilding. Then he needed the time to train a large team of helpers.\\nFinally, he was assigned the daunting and dangerous task of preaching the\\nmessage of coming judgment during that time. The time element is consistent\\nwith a global flood.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nScripture reports that the Flood continued to rise for 150 days, covering\\nthe highest hills and taking all human life outside the Ark. By comparison\\nthe Great Mississippi Flood was the most destructive river flood in the\\nhistory of the United States, with 27,000 square miles inundated in depths\\nof up to 30 feet in early 1927. Yet it did not cover all the surrounding\\nhills and drowned barely a fraction of the population. Following 150 days\\nof rising water, the Ark passengers could not disembark for another 221\\ndays because it took that long for the land to dry out and be safe. When\\nthe animals were released, they would quickly travel up to hundreds of\\nmiles in all directions from the Ark and all that land had to be safe for\\nthem. No local flood has produced conditions across thousands of miles that\\ntook over a year to return to normal.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAnother unique feature of the Flood is that the chief character, Noah, is\\nranked with Daniel and Job as the most righteous man in history (Ezekiel\\n14:14, 20). In the entire Flood narrative God does the speaking and Noah\\ndoes the obeying with no indication of hesitation or back talk. How\\ndifferent is the story of Moses from the burning bush to his striking of\\nthe rock. God couldn\\'t blot out such a righteous man as Noah. This world\\'s\\nmost righteous individual of the day was suitable for dealing with the\\nworld\\'s most unusual flood of all time.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAs to geography some local flood proponents suggest that mankind had not\\nspread out worldwide, that he only occupied a small area of the world, so\\nonly a local flood was needed to blot out all flesh. This argument assumes\\nthat the geography of the earth before the Flood was the same as today.\\nThat notion has been changing over the past fifty years. Now creationists\\nwith relevant scientific backgrounds think the geography of the earth\\'s\\nsurface was vastly different before the Flood and this is consistent with\\nGenesis chapter one. Since all the land was in one place, just one super\\ncontinent existed. This condition means that man was not spread out over\\nthe entire globe but was found in just the super continent portion of the\\nearth.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe mechanism which brought on the Flood broke up the super continent. The\\npieces of land moved over an unknown period of time to form today\\'s major\\ncontinents and many islands. The mechanism that started this process, while\\nnot yet understood, involved a destabilizing of the earth\\'s mantle as it\\nbelched vast amounts of volcanic material. The continuing volcanic activity\\nalso sustained the warmed oceans and a thin atmospheric haze to produce the\\none-time conditions for an estimated 1000-year ice age which then reshaped\\nvast portions of the deposits made by the Flood.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nGod stated another worldwide change. It is so astonishing that expositors\\nhesitate to take it at face value yet it explains how the animals and their\\nkeepers could live peaceably on the Ark for a year. Apparently, the fall\\ndid not alienate man and animals. While some humans may have harmed\\nanimals, the general population lived peaceably with them. But in some way\\nthe Flood caused a nutritional need for man that only animal flesh could\\nsupply. While God gave only the green plants for food before the Flood, He\\nadded animal flesh to man\\'s diet after the Flood. Here are the words of God\\nHimself:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    <sup>2</sup>\\n    [God said] \"The fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every\\n    beast of the earth and upon every bird of the heavens, upon everything\\n    that creeps on the ground and all the fish of the sea. Into your hand\\n    they are delivered. <sup>3</sup>Every moving thing that lives shall be\\n    food for you. And as I gave you the green plants, I give you\\n    everything.\" Genesis 9:2-3.\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nYet another unique feature of the Flood was the covenant God established\\nbetween \"me and you and every living creature that is with you, for all\\nfuture generations\" (Genesis 9:12) which was sealed with a sign that is\\nseen all over the world.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    <sup>11</sup>\\n    \"Never again shall all flesh be cut off by the waters of the flood, and\\n    never again shall there be a flood to destroy the earth.\" <sup>13</sup>\\n    \"I have set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be a sign of the covenant\\n    between me and the earth. <sup>14</sup>When I bring clouds over the\\n    earth and the bow is seen in the clouds, <sup>15</sup>I will remember\\n    my covenant that is between me and you and every living creature of all\\n    flesh. And the waters shall never again become a flood to destroy all\\n    flesh. <sup>16</sup>When the bow is in the clouds, I will see it and\\n    remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature\\n    of all flesh that is on the earth\" Genesis 9:11, 13-16.\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe sign of the rainbow reaches as far as Noah\\'s Flood reached. It is\\nworld-wide because the Flood was world-wide. As numerous defenders of the\\nBible have pointed out, vastly devastating local floods have occurred\\nthousands of times down through the centuries, so if Noah\\'s Flood were\\nlocal, God who cannot lie would have lied many times.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nLastly are the multiple statements related to repopulating the world. Six\\ntimes Scripture repeats this idea:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Genesis 9:1</strong>\\n\"And God blessed Noah and his sons and said to them, \\'Be fruitful and\\nmultiply and fill the earth.\\'\"\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Genesis 9:7</strong>\\n\"And you (Hebrew-plural), be fruitful and multiply, increase greatly on the\\nearth and multiply in it.\"\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Genesis 9:19</strong>\\n\"These three were the sons of Noah, and from these the people of the whole\\nearth were dispersed.\"\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Genesis 10:5</strong>\\n\"From these (sons of Japheth) the coastland peoples spread in their lands,\\neach with his own language, by their clans, in their nations.\"\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Genesis 10:32</strong>\\n\"These are the clans of the sons of Noah, according to their genealogies,\\nin their nations and from these the nations spread abroad on the earth\\nafter the flood.\"\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Genesis 11:8</strong>\\n\"So the LORD dispersed them from there over the face of all the earth.\"\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThese nine unique features of the Flood utterly distinguish it from any\\nother flood in all history.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>The Day-Age View </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nVast scientific research finds the universe billions of years old. Physics\\nhas reached the point where it recognizes that if creation began as a tight\\nball of infinitely hot and compact matter, it would fly apart at an\\nastronomical rate and in 14.3 billion years spread out to today\\'s universe.\\nIn deference some creationists have sought for Scriptural agreement by\\ninterpreting the days of creation week as vast periods of time. They notice\\nthat the Hebrew noun for day has different shades of meaning as do most\\nHebrew words. One of those shades of meaning for \"day\" is a period of time.\\nOn this basis they view the days of creation as periods of time.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nTo be sure, throughout Scripture \"day\" is used in different senses. But the\\nlaws of hermeneutics require the interpreter first to see if Scripture\\nitself defines those days in Genesis one, and if so, to accept the\\nScriptural definition. So, does Scripture itself define the length of those\\ndays? Indeed it does. The fifth commandment sets up an analogy between\\nman\\'s work week and God\\'s creation week. Israel was to follow the pattern\\nset by God. This means Hebrews were to work six days just as God worked six\\ndays and then rest on the seventh day just as God rested on the seventh\\nday.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    <sup>8</sup>\\n    Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. <sup>9</sup>Six days you\\n    shall labor, and do all your work, <sup>10</sup>but the seventh day is\\n    a Sabbath to the LORD your God. On it you shall not do any work, you,\\n    or your son, or your daughter&#8230;. <sup>11</sup>For in six days the\\n    LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and\\n    rested on the seventh day. Therefore the LORD blessed the Sabbath day\\n    and made it holy. Exodus 20:8-11.\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWe can first eliminate any idea that the word \"day\" in verses referring to\\nman\\'s work week was longer than a normal day. Exodus 23:12 is specific:\\n\"Six <strong>days</strong> you shall do your work, but on the seventh    <strong>day</strong> you shall rest; that your ox and your donkey may have\\nrest, and the son of your servant woman, and the alien, may be refreshed.\"\\nBesides Exodus 20:9-10 and 23:12, this idea is stated in yet a third place:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    <sup>2</sup>\\n    Six days work shall be done, but on the seventh day you shall have a\\n    Sabbath of solemn rest, holy to the LORD. Whoever does any work on it\\n    shall be put to death. <sup>3</sup>You shall kindle no fire in all your\\n    dwelling places on the Sabbath day. Exodus 35:2-3.\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSo these three passages settle the issue of whether the days in man\\'s week\\nwere literal or not. Beyond doubt they were literal. But the question\\nbefore us is \"Were God\\'s creation days literal?\" At this point, the day-age\\nfolks make an observation that might raise uncertainty. They observe that\\nthe seventh day of creation week was not framed chronologically by an\\nevening and a morning. They are correct to the extent those words are not\\nused in association with the seventh day. The day-age people then take\\ntheir observation to the next level by saying this indicates that since the\\nwork of creation was done, God not only rested on the seventh day but is\\nstill resting today. So now, according to their reasoning, one of the days\\nof Genesis 1:1-2:3 is longer than a normal day. In the end, they conclude\\nall the days were longer than normal.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nA continuing seventh day is a crucial first step to their argument for the\\ndays being ages. So, they spend much time explaining the Scriptures in both\\nthe Old and New Testaments that speak of God offering His rest to humans.\\nThen they associate those rests with the rest of God following the sixth\\nday of creation week. While the subject could consume an entire Bible study\\n(and pages of this book), we will state simply that each of these three\\nrests was different. God rested for one day to set a pattern for the\\nSabbath rest.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe rest God offered Israel was the rest of being a nation with their own\\ngeographical territory. To acquire that land, they had to fight, not rest.\\nTo be prosperous, they had to work the land six days a week, not rest. That\\nrest was interrupted when Assyria captured the Northern Kingdom and Babylon\\ncaptured the Southern Kingdom. The rest offered since Calvary is the rest\\nof eternal salvation, gained by believing on Jesus Christ. That rest never\\nends. God gives one kind of rest to Israel and another kind to NT\\nbelievers. Since those are rests from the hand of God, He calls them \"My\\nrest,\" but they are not the rest of the seventh day of creation week.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nGod is working today, not resting, according to the words of Jesus: \"My\\nfather works until now and I work\" (John 5:17). At a future time, God will\\nperform a new work of creation, a new heaven and a new earth. So the rest\\nof God on day seven of creation week lasted one normal day. All seven days\\nof Genesis 1:1-2:3 are literal, normal days in which God shrank millions\\nand even billions of years of development of the universe and earth into\\nsix literal days.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nPerhaps evening and morning were left out so that what was said would stand\\nout. God blessed the seventh day, the only day of the seven He blessed.\\nThis was not a general blessing but a very specific blessing. In effect by\\nsetting the seventh day apart as holy, God consecrated it for all time.\\nThis was long before God gave the Mosaic Law. From this seventh day on, it\\nwould proclaim God as the Creator. To violate it by making it other than a\\nnormal day would be to desecrate what God made holy. Exodus 31:17 is the\\nfullest biblical statement of the purpose of the seventh day. It signifies\\nthat God created everything in six days. Here is what it says:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    \"It is a sign forever between me and the people of Israel that in six\\n    days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested\\n    and was refreshed.\" Exodus 31:17.\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSo the seventh day is a sign. For the sign to work the previous periods\\nmust be days not years or billions of years. If they are not normal days,\\nthe sign is destroyed. While the words seem repetitive, one could say \"The\\nseventh day throughout human history witnesses to God as the Creator and\\nthat He did the work of creation in six normal days. What Scripture itself\\nsays about the seventh day is truly remarkable and what Scripture itself\\nsays needs to be the creationist\\'s focus.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nReturning to the days of Genesis one, days are stated as ordinal, not\\ncardinal numbers in the creation account. Cardinal numbers follow the\\npattern of \"one,\" \"two,\" \"three.\" Ordinal numbers express the order of\\nthings and follow the pattern of \"first,\" \"second,\" \"third.\" In arguing for\\nthe seventh day continuing to the present, some observe that the King James\\nVersion translated the days as a sentence: \"And the evening and the morning\\nwere the first day\" (Genesis 1:5). They are correct to the extent that the\\nverb is not associated with the noun \"day\" but with the nouns \"evening\" and\\n\"morning.\" The English Standard Version correctly translates: \"And there\\nwas evening and there was morning.\" The next two Hebrew words are the\\nadjective \"first\" and the noun \"day.\" In English we would say, \"The first\\nday.\" Some have incorrectly observed that the definite article is used for\\nthe first six days but not the seventh day. The fact is, the definite\\narticle is not found with any of the seven days. Rather, it is a given in\\nthe construction itself. This definite article argument is a red herring\\nused to buttress the day-age view.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSome might raise objections by pointing out that \"Sabbath\" can be a day, a\\nyear or even a lot of years. True, but Scripture generally indicates which\\nkind of a Sabbath is meant, i.e., a Sabbath day, a Sabbath year or a\\nSabbath of Sabbath years. For instance, Leviticus 25 introduces a\\nparticular kind of Sabbath: \"the land shall keep a Sabbath to the LORD\"\\n(Leviticus 25:2). Verses three, four and five explain: <sup>3</sup>\"For six    <strong>years</strong> you shall sow your field&#8230; <sup>4</sup>But in\\nthe seventh <strong>year</strong> there shall be a sabbath of solemn rest\\nfor the land, a Sabbath to the LORD. You shall not sow&#8230;<sup>5</sup>\\nYou shall not reap&#8230;. It shall be a solemn rest for the land.\" God\\npermitted people to take food from it for themselves and their livestock,\\nbut for an entire year they were not to work it. The Sabbath year was for\\nthe benefit of the land. This was three millennia before modern\\nagricultural practices.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe Sabbath year had other features outlined in the entire fifteenth\\nchapter of Deuteronomy. \"At the end of seven <strong>years</strong> you\\nshall grant a release\" (Deuteronomy 15:1). \"He shall serve you six    <strong>years</strong> and in the seventh <strong>year</strong> you shall\\nlet him go\" (Deuteronomy 15:12). \"He has served you six    <strong>years</strong>\" (Deuteronomy 15:18). The word \"day\" is not found in\\nthis chapter because the subject is years, not days. \"At the end of seven    <strong>years</strong> in the <strong>year</strong> of release\"\\n(Deuteronomy 31:10). On other occasions Scripture uses the word \"day\" for a\\nnormal day. \"For six <strong>days</strong> you shall eat unleavened bread\\nand on the seventh <strong>day</strong>&#8230;\" (Deuteronomy 16:8).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSo, when the Scripture wants to speak of years, it uses that word over and\\nover. Likewise, it uses the word \"day\" hundreds of times for an ordinary\\nday. Why should the words for \"day\" and \"year\" be understood any\\ndifferently in Genesis 1-11? In the genealogies we read \"all the    <strong>days</strong> of Seth were 912 <strong>years</strong>\" (Genesis\\n5:8). All those days added up to 912 years. All those days were normal\\ndays. In the same way Genesis 2:4 states, \"In the <strong>day</strong> that\\nthe LORD God made the earth and the heavens\" (Genesis 2:4). Looking back\\nthere was the first day, the second day, the third day, etc. When summed\\nthe total was six normal days.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nOne troubling thought comes with the idea that according to the day-age\\ntheory, late in day six when man was created was 50,000 to 150,000 years\\nago. Scripture gives us 2000 years of well-established biblical history\\nfrom Abraham to Christ and the 2000 years from Christ to the present. Even\\nthose 4000 years seem immense when one considers that the current signs of\\nthe times point to Christ\\'s return at any time. Saying that 46,000 to\\n146,000 years of undescribed divine activity in the affairs of man is\\ninconsistent with the biblical revelation of a God who acts deliberately\\nand in a timely way. Let us prefer what the Bible says with regard to those\\nsix days of creation than an interpretation based on today\\'s science. That\\nis the life of faith.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nMany ancient people such as the Greeks and religions such as Hinduism\\nbelieved that matter was eternal and evil. The 2<sup>nd</sup> law of\\nthermodynamics states the universe is expanding indicating matter had a\\nbeginning. Creationist and astrophysicist Hugh Ross founded Reasons to\\nBelieve which confirms the Scriptural account of creation through recent\\nscientific findings. To date he claims to have found 250 such reasons to\\nbelieve the Bible. Dr. Ross is a leading defender of the day-age theory so\\nhe subscribes to the age of the creation if produced by God at the normal\\nspeed of 14.3 billion years. We believe his 14.3 billion years are better\\nexplained by a God who is all-powerful and compressed all that work into\\nsix normal days.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nDr. Ross believes that the entire universe is necessary just to support\\nlife on one planet, the earth. We agree. Of special note, he speaks of one\\nscientific development that might well explain day two of creation week. He\\nsays that in 1999 astrophysicists discovered dark matter and estimates that\\nit is the dominant component of the universe, currently comprising 70% of\\nits mass. It is embedded in the edge of the universe and is fine tuned to\\ncontinue the universe\\'s expansion which must happen to sustain life on\\nearth. We believe dark matter best explains the waters above the heavens\\nwhen God separated them from the earth on day two of creation week. We will\\nknow for sure in heaven, but creationists owe Dr. Ross their appreciation\\nfor his ministry of acknowledging creation as testifying to the existence\\nof the God of the Bible.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Extra Name in Shem\\'s Genealogy</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe DSS expose an error commonly repeated by creationists who defend the    <em>MT</em>. It has to do with a second Cainan in Luke\\'s genealogy of\\nChrist. See Appendix 8.6.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<a name=\"_Hlk86050577\">\\n    <strong>Arguments from Meaning of Names and Symmetry</strong>\\n</a>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nA very different approach used by some creationists to determine whether\\nthe <em>LXX</em> or <em>MT</em> of Shem\\'s line is the correct reading is to\\nstudy the meaning of names. These views are held by Christians with a rich\\ntradition of intense study of God\\'s Word. For their sakes    <em>Hidden Beauty</em> provides thought for their consideration, but\\nbecause this chapter is so long, see Appendix 8.7 for    <a name=\"_Hlk76823776\">our discussion of the subject. </a>\\n</p>\\n<p align=\"center\">\\n<strong>When Were the Birthing Years Changed?</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>History of the Masoretic Text</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWe began the chapter with the puzzling problem of two Old Testament texts.\\nOne is the official Textus Receptus of Judaism, the Hebrew Masora (    <em>Masoretic Text</em>). The other is the Greek translation of a different\\nHebrew textual family. How do two different textual traditions square with\\ninerrancy? Scriptural inerrancy applies only to the original writing. About\\n98% of the OT was written in Hebrew. All agree the original autographs were\\nlost long ago.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAfter divine revelation and enablement to record it comes preservation. God\\nused Israel to preserve the MT as is seen in the oldest existing MT, the\\nAleppo Codex of c. 930 AD. Looking at the details, with the fall of\\nJerusalem in 70 AD devout Jews sought to protect the copies of the    <em>MT</em> they possessed. Faithful copying continued for the next 400\\nyears. Then around 500 AD several families of priests began composing rules\\nfor copying. Over the next 400 years these rules would become the standard\\nfor copying the Hebrew Old Testament. These scribes became known as\\nMasoretes, so eventually the text they preserved became known as the\\nMasoretic Text. It was the same text copied at Qumran a millennium earlier.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSome charge that the Masoretes and those before them changed the text in a\\nnumber of ways. They point to the change from the Phoenician script to the\\nChaldean block alphabet. This is a false charge because if alphabets\\nchange, for Scripture to be understood, the letters in it must also be\\nchanged. Then these critics charge that the keepers of the official text\\nadded vowels. This is true. But they also added more. Originally, the text\\nonly contained consonants and the letters of each line stood side by side\\nwithout breaks. At some point the scribes added spaces between words, marks\\nthat indicated vowels, marks to show pronunciation and cantillation, and\\neven marks to indicate paragraphs. Someone also added chapters and verses.\\nWho would want to go back to letters without vowels or breaks from margin\\nto margin?\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBut the critics point out that consonants without vowels can become\\ndifferent words depending on which vowels are used, where they are used and\\nhow many are used. For an example in English, the three consonants \"slt\"\\ncan mean entirely different things depending on these variables:\\nsalt/silt/slat/slit/slot/slut/slate/salute. But the alternative is that\\nevery reader must sort this out for himself, in effect requiring him to\\nbecome an expert in this. On the basis of tradition and much learning the\\nscribes were in a far better position to determine the correct word than\\nthe average reader. So vowel pointing actually helped to clarify the text\\nfor those seeking its guidance.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThen the critics point to the explanations the Masoretes put in the outside\\nmargin and below the text. These did not change the text at all. The\\nMasorah parva are statistical notes in the outside margin of each page.\\nThis was all a part of counting all the words in a book or all the letters\\non a page, etc. That certainly didn\\'t change the text. The Masorah magna\\nare notes below the text on each page that in effect expand on the Masorah\\nparva. It will actually cite entire verses found elsewhere that contain a\\ncertain word. This was before the addition of chapters and verses. That\\ndidn\\'t change the text in any way.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nFinally, the Critical Apparatus is the section below the Masorah magna that\\ncontains questions and uncertainties about the text. They are most helpful\\nas a permanent reminder of variant readings and other information related\\nto the text. Clearly, the Critical Apparatus does not change the text.\\nRather, it is a reminder that some question the text at that point and\\nmaybe someday the problem will be resolved. While charging that the Hebrew\\nscribes changed the text through the centuries has taken in a lot of\\ngullible readers; just the opposite is true. The notes in the outside\\nmargin and at the bottom of each page along with the many marks within the\\ntext have helped to improve the clarity of the text through the centuries.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Transmission of Scripture</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAlong with the preservation of Scripture comes its transmission. While\\ninspiration is completely divine and thus without error, the preservation\\nand transmission of Scripture involve mankind. While God will never let\\npreservation deteriorate so the message is lost, history testifies that\\nthose who have high respect for God will diligently copy and translate the\\nScripture. God has always had such servants. As a result, today\\'s Bible is\\nentirely adequate to instruct the follower of God in His will. Since few\\nspeak biblical Hebrew today, God\\'s servants have translated the Bible into\\nthousands of modern languages. It was no different in the days of Jesus and\\nthe New Testament writers. Even back then few spoke biblical Hebrew. Even\\nthen they needed a translation of the original text. But now the Old\\nTestament is available in its original language and possibly a thousand\\nscholars worldwide can work with the myriads of documents to determine the\\nmost exact reading. The <em>MT</em> like every other copy of the Bible has\\naccumulated scribal errors and even deliberate changes through the years.\\nBut most importantly it is to be preferred because it is in the original\\nlanguage of the OT.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Development of the Old Testament Canon</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nFollowing revelation and inspiration at some point the revelation is also\\nrecognized as authoritative and thus binding on all mankind. That is\\ncanonization. Canonization happened immediately in the case of the books of\\nMoses. At the point where Moses completed the Pentateuch, the OT consisted\\nof five books. They were placed in the care of the priesthood of Israel.\\nThe priesthood was responsible for preserving, teaching and transmitting\\nthe books of Moses. In time a special class of priest called scribes would\\nbe trained to make copies of God\\'s revelation.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe second clear step in the canonization of the OT came with the work of\\nSamuel. Samuel, though a member of the tribe of Levi, was not a descendant\\nof Aaron and thus not qualified to be an Aaronic priest. In admirable\\nintegrity he somehow prevented being called a priest in Scripture and most\\nlikely in life. But because Eli\\'s sons were wicked and Eli was elderly, God\\nused Samuel to serve as a faithful priest during that ugly period when\\nEli\\'s sons were the official priests. Beyond that God began the line of\\nprophets with Samuel. Further, as the last judge he provided the binding\\nforce of government in Israel. He was a type of Christ, combining the three\\nfunctions of leadership in a society under God-prophet, priest and king\\n(the judges were the forerunner of kings). Samuel trained Eli\\'s sons\\' sons\\nto be faithful priests so that the next three generations of Eli\\'s\\ndescendants faithfully served the office of priest until the priesthood was\\ntransferred back to the line of Aaron through Eleazar in the days of Zadok.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nI Chronicles 9:22 credits Samuel along with David for organizing and\\nstandardizing the service of the priesthood in the Tabernacle. Samuel also\\nscrupulously honored the canon of the Law and wrote and/or certified the\\nbooks of Joshua, Judges, Ruth and most of First Samuel that tell about his\\nministry and David\\'s years before the death of Saul. Samuel faithfully\\ndeclared God\\'s word in his lifetime so the portions of Scripture that he\\nproduced were likewise canonical when he produced them.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe third period of canonization came in the days of David and Solomon.\\nThey were neither priests nor prophets but they expressed worship and\\ndivine wisdom. Their books would begin a third section of Scripture, the\\nwritings. God showed His unique pleasure with David by giving him victories\\nover the enemies of Israel and giving him the promise of a house that would\\nlast forever. God likewise placed His approval on Solomon by granting him\\nthe wisdom he asked for and expanding his kingdom. Later, God authenticated\\nthe books of the prophets with fulfilled prophecy. In this way the fourth\\nperiod of canonization was accomplished. Finally, the work of Ezra the\\npriest testifies to much work with Scripture. He would have completed the\\nOld Testament Scripture except for brief portions added after his time.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nJesus refers to Scripture several hundred times with various statements\\nsuch as \"It is written\" or \"Moses said.\" On the day of his resurrection\\n\"Beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he interpreted to them in all\\nthe Scriptures the things concerning himself\" (Luke 24:27). On a later\\npost-resurrection appearance he said, \"Everything written about me in the\\nLaw of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled\" (Luke\\n24:44). These are the three sections of the Old Testament. The next verse\\nsays \"He opened their minds to understand the Scriptures\" (Luke 24:45). God\\nthe Son called these writings Scripture. Thirty years later the Apostle\\nPaul would write \"All Scripture is God-breathed\" (II Timothy 3:16).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe DSS make no distinction between these books called Scripture and the\\nmany other religious books in the collection. From this DSS scholars\\nconclude that the OT canon was not yet established in Israel at that time.\\nIt is true that no body of believers had yet certified a list of divinely\\ninspired books. But while unbelievers may have been uncertain about which\\nbooks belonged to that category, the words of Jesus in the Gospels and the\\nwritings of the Apostles in the rest of the New Testament show that the\\ngodly knew which books were Scripture. Therefore, canonization by a large\\nbody of Christians must not be confused with the recognition of\\nauthoritative books by believers.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe voice of the splinter group at Qumran that disappeared from 70 AD until\\nthe discovery of the DSS cannot begin to compare with the voice of the New\\nTestament church which became a major movement within the entire Roman\\nEmpire and constantly spoke of \"Scripture.\" The community at Qumran was\\nentirely comfortable with writing books of religious fiction and storing\\nthem beside the books of the OT. These were the kind of anti-OT material NT\\nwriters warned about. Undoubtedly Paul had such Qumranian favorites as the    <em>Book of Jubilees</em> and the <em>Book of Enoch</em> in mind when he\\ninstructed Timothy to \"charge certain persons not to teach any different\\ndoctrine, nor to devote themselves to myths&#8230;\" (I Timothy 1:3-4).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe Apostle\\'s words \"Certain persons&#8230;have wandered away into vain\\ndiscussion, desiring to be teachers of the law [but] without\\nunderstanding&#8230;what they are saying\" (I Timothy 1:6-7) would have\\nincluded the Qumranians\\' extensive teaching of the law in their sectarian\\nbooks such as the <em>Community Rule</em>. Of the Qumranian type of\\nasceticism he wrote \"Now the Spirit expressly says that in later times some\\nwill depart from the faith by devoting themselves to deceitful spirits and\\nteachings of demons&#8230; who forbid marriage and require abstinence from\\nfoods that God created to be received with thanksgiving&#8230;\" (I Timothy\\n4:1-3).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nFurther, only individual OT books were found at Qumran, not groups of books\\nbound together to indicate they were equally authoritative. To dismiss the\\nDSS because they were the product of heretics is to miss their value. But\\nto overstate their meaning with such statements as \"they prove there was no\\nOT canon during the Second Temple [Herod\\'s Temple] Period\" is equally\\nharmful. What they do show is that various versions of the OT existed\\nbetween 100 BC and 70 AD, that scribes faithfully copied them through the\\ncenturies to follow and that by far the preferred OT text at Qumran was the\\nbasis of the Masoretic Text.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Answer to \"When Were the Birthing Years Changed?\"</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAs reported earlier, Emanuel Tov has concluded that the Samaritan\\nPentateuch and the Hebrew forerunner of the LXX were originally one\\ndocument. Since the Samaritan Pentateuch was composed after Solomon when\\nIsrael separated from Judah, the years could have been changed any time\\nafter that. Solomon\\'s kingdom gained a much greater understanding of the\\nhistory of Israel\\'s neighbors, so seeds for changing those numbers could\\nhave formed that early.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBut why would the Jerusalem Elders select a text for translation into Greek\\nthat was only 1/7<sup>th</sup> as popular as the preferred Torah text at\\nQumran? That question can be answered by another question: \"Wouldn\\'t they\\nselect the version they felt would best be received in the Greek world?\"\\nThey would have had broad knowledge of Greek thinking. They knew the Greeks\\nbelieved in more years of civilization than the majority Hebrew text\\nreported. It apparently was a small thing to them to carry to Alexandria\\nthe Hebrew text that recognized the most years since they knew the Greeks\\nbelieved the Great Pyramid of Giza was built 300 years before the Flood\\ndate found in the majority Hebrew text.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nHow tragic that the 70 had become so insensitive to their own sacred\\nwritings that they could not recognize the very nature of Hebrew\\ngenealogies, that they were about identification of descendants with\\nancestors and ancestors with descendants rather than records of precise\\nsuccession.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Weighing the LXX Textual Quality</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAs textual scholars study the two texts, they find occasional scribal\\nerrors in the MT that can be corrected from the LXX text. See Appendix 8.7\\nfor four such instances. Appendix 8.7 also explains how changes in the LXX\\ndirected the location of Abraham\\'s homeland to Urfa in Northwest\\nMesopotamia instead of Ur 700 miles to the Southeast.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nOur next three chapters become a unit on the Book of Job. They describe a\\nworld awash in history eight or nine generations before Peleg but many\\ngenerations after Eber. They add further evidence of a global flood nearly\\ntwo millennia before Ussher\\'s too late Flood date (2348 BC).\\n</p>\\n<br clear=\"all\"/>\\n<div>\\n<br clear=\"all\"/>\\n<hr width=\"33%\" size=\"1\" align=\"left\"/>\\n<div id=\"ftn1\">\\n    <p>\\n        <a href=\"#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\" title=\"\">[1]</a>\\nPete Williams, \"Some Remarks Preliminary to a Biblical Chronology,\"            <em>Journal of Creation</em>, 12(1) April 1998: 98-106.\\n    </p>\\n</div>\\n<div id=\"ftn2\">\\n    <p>\\n        <a href=\"#_ftnref2\" name=\"_ftn2\" title=\"\">[2]</a>\\n        Emanuel Tov, \"The Biblical DSS as Representing Variety in Judaism\\n        and Early Christianity,\" posted 3/2020; (Search on the Title).\\n    </p>\\n</div>\\n<div id=\"ftn3\">\\n    <p>\\n        <a href=\"#_ftnref3\" name=\"_ftn3\" title=\"\">[3]</a>\\n        Tov, ibid.\\n    </p>\\n</div>\\n<div id=\"ftn4\">\\n    <p>\\n        <a href=\"#_ftnref4\" name=\"_ftn4\" title=\"\">[4]</a>\\n        Emanuel Tov, \"The Genealogical Lists in Genesis 5 and 11 in Three\\n        Different Versions,\" 37-52.

The goal of this and the next two chapters is to\\nshowcase the many ways that do date Job. As a consequence, his life and\\ntimes demand an earlier Flood date. The following ideas will be developed\\nin these three chapters:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n1. Job lived 280 years which places his birth in the 35-55 generation gap\\nbetween Eber and Peleg.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n2. Job lived when dinosaurs dwelt without fear of humans in the Jordan\\nValley.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n3. Job lived in the declining years of the Great Ice Age. The book contains\\n15 distinct kinds of ice age phenomena.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n4. God orchestrated Job\\'s ordeal to show mankind how malicious and\\ndangerous Satan is. This message was needed early in God\\'s revelation to\\nman.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n5. Job descended from Shem through Aram and Uz. Knowledge of God was still\\nabundant in his land. A far different picture is seen in that same land in\\nthe days of Sodom and Gomorrah, half a millennium later.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n6. Peleg\\'s name means \"divided by water\" and most likely refers to the\\nclosing days of the Ice Age when glacial melt and subsequent rising sea\\nlevel covered land bridges between continents.\\n</p>\\n<p align=\"center\">\\n<strong>280-Year Lifespan (2690-2410 BC)</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWe must start with Job\\'s lifespan found at the end of the book. In his\\nextreme pain Job had said regrettable things about God. After he repented\\nand prayed for his friends the book concludes by reporting that God doubled\\nall he had (Job 42:10). This doubling included ten more children, the same\\nnumber that perished at the time of Satan\\'s attack. Why not 20? Job only\\nneeded ten more to double the original ten because he would have all 20\\nwith him forever in heaven. His years followed the same pattern. He lived\\n140 years after his ordeal (Job 42:16). His ordeal had not erased from his\\nmind the memories of those former years of walking with God and building a\\nranching empire. Doubling his years was like doubling his children-he lived\\n140 years after his ordeal to double the 140 years he lived before his\\nordeal, giving him a total lifespan of 280 years.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe above is our conclusion, but how did we get there? Job chapter 42\\nbegins with the doubling of his animals, not his children or his years.\\nVerse 12 says \"he had 14,000 sheep, 6,000 camels 1,000 yoke of oxen, and\\n1,000 female donkeys.\" These numbers are exactly twice as many animals as\\nhe had just before his ordeal, for Job 1:3 states, \"He possessed 7,000\\nsheep, 3,000 camels, 500 yoke of oxen, and 500 female donkeys.\" Then came\\nthe attack of the enemy. Fire from heaven took the sheep. Chaldeans stole\\nthe camels and Sabeans plundered the oxen and donkeys. Job never saw them\\nagain. After his ordeal relatives showed him sympathy and gave him money\\nand gold (Job 42:11). With this start he began to rebuild his stock. By the\\nend of his life 140 years later Scripture reports that he had exactly twice\\nas many animals as before Satan\\'s attack. Indeed, God did double his\\nlivestock.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Doubling Job\\'s Children</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nNext, Scripture speaks of his children. After Job\\'s ordeal, Scripture\\nstates that \"He had also seven sons and three daughters\" (Job 42:13). To do\\nthis God obviously restored his health. Ten is the same number that he\\noriginally had for Job 1:2 reported \"There were born to him seven sons and\\nthree daughters.\" Satan killed them all by sending a wind that collapsed\\nthe house of the oldest brother where they were celebrating. But there is\\nan apparent problem. On the one hand \"The LORD gave Job twice as much as he\\nhad before\" (Job 42: 10). On the other hand, the LORD gave him only ten\\nmore children, not twenty. Why only ten more? Wouldn\\'t it take twenty to\\ndouble them? The answer is that there is a fundamental difference between\\nJob\\'s animals and his children. Those first animals were lost to Job\\nforever. Job would never see them again. But those first seven sons and\\nthree daughters were not lost forever when the great wind took them.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nJob\\'s family believed in the true God, the Creator. When they were killed,\\nthey went to glory and are there with Job today along with the second set\\nof ten. Job has twenty sons and daughters with him forever. God did double\\nhis children even though doubling them would only take giving him ten more\\nwhereas doubling his animals would require heaven to stock his land with\\ntwice the number he had before his ordeal. Heaven\\'s math is flawless.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Doubling Job\\'s Years</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nFinally, the last verse of Job states that he lived 140 years after his\\nordeal. We understand those years matched the years before his ordeal. But\\n280 years places his birth before that of Abraham, Terah, Serug, Reu and\\neven Peleg. No known commentator views Job to have lived 280 years.\\nInvariably Job is given a shorter lifespan. Why? Where do they go astray?\\nJob 42:9 says \"The LORD restored the fortunes of Job.\" Job 42:12 says \"the\\nLORD blessed the latter days of Job more than his beginning,\" while 42:10\\nis more specific: \"The LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before.\" Then\\nScripture gives specific numbers in three categories-his animals, his\\nchildren and his years.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nMany students of Scripture conclude the doubling only applied to his\\ncattle. They reason that while he received twice as many animals but only\\nthe same number of children as before, the doubling only applied to\\nmaterial possessions. They conclude that only ten more would contradict the\\nstatement that God doubled all he had so the doubling only applied to his\\nanimals. Yet others do include his children but not his years. Some even\\ninclude his years but state that he lived 70 years before his ordeal and\\nGod doubled that number after his ordeal, so that he lived 140 years after\\nhis ordeal for a total lifespan of 210 years (70+140=210).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIt is true that Job involves much mystery, especially about when he lived\\nand when the book was written; the ideas and form of poetry are so\\nadvanced-how could the events have taken place so early? Some find the time\\nof the Patriarchs to be a good fit because Jacob\\'s twin brother Esau had a\\nson named Eliphaz (Genesis 36:4, 10, 11). They suggest he was the leader of\\nthe three friends who came to comfort Job. The Eliphaz in the book of Job\\nwas from Teman and a town by that name existed in Edom, the nation Esau\\nfounded. Others notice that    <a name=\"__DdeLink__10783_547388351\">Issachar</a>\\'s third son was Yob (Job)\\nand suggest that he might have decided to go out on his own after Jacob\\nmoved his people to Egypt, settling in the Sinai Peninsula where they say\\nJob lived. They strengthen this argument by adding that Moses may have\\nknown him during the forty years Moses lived in the Sinai with Jethro, the\\npriest of Midian. They suggest this was how Moses learned Job\\'s story.\\n(Jewish tradition holds Moses to be the author of Job.)\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBut people weren\\'t living to the age of 280 or even 210 in Esau\\'s day.\\nEsau\\'s brother Jacob lived 147 years, Levi lived 137 years and Moses lived\\n120 years. Further, names are often repeated in Scripture. Most tellingly,\\nthe city of Teman existed before it was taken over by the Edomites. The\\nwhole idea of Issachar\\'s son leaving Jacob\\'s extended family in Egypt is\\nunlikely. Finally, Job knowing Moses is impossible since the Eliphaz who\\nwas Esau\\'s son would have lived when Jacob moved his people to Egypt,\\nhundreds of years before Moses was born.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nStill others disregard the length of Job\\'s life entirely and suggest he\\nlived during or shortly before the days of David because the poetry of Job\\nis like that of Psalms and Solomon\\'s books. But by that time the average\\nlifespan was 70, only half as long as Job lived after his ordeal. In the\\ndiscourses Eliphaz refutes Job\\'s position by asking if Job was so old that\\nhe possessed all knowledge. \"Are you the first man who was born? Or were\\nyou brought forth before the hills? Have you listened in the council of\\nGod? And do you limit wisdom to yourself?\" Job 15:8-9. Eliphaz next answers\\nhis question with \"Both the gray-haired and the aged are among us, older\\nthan your father\" 15:10.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nJob was not near the end of his life when Satan struck. His father was\\nstill alive and people even older than his father described as \"the\\ngray-haired and the aged\" were living in his day. Nevertheless, in chapter\\n42 God says that Job spoke correctly about Him while his three comforters\\ndid not which indicates he already had to have lived many years to gain his\\nknowledge of God. Therefore, Job had already lived many years at the time\\nof his ordeal and others were considerably older.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSo, the usual practice is to focus on the animals but not dwell on his\\nchildren or years. What does Scripture do? His animals are mentioned first;\\nthey were the least important, the most superficial; there is no\\nelaboration. His children were far more important so Scripture not only\\nreports their number but elaborates significantly on them. Lastly, his\\nyears were the most important of all. Scripture reports their number and\\nelaborates on them with unusual detail as well. This structuring reinforces\\nthe idea that the doubling applied to his children and his lifespan as well\\nas his animals. When they are viewed in this light, only one conclusion\\nremains-Job\\'s children set the pattern for the doubling of his years. Job\\nlived a total of 280 years.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Four Generations in Job\\'s Second Family</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWhat Scripture says about those years after his ordeal reinforces our view.\\nThe sequence begins with \"After this Job lived 140 years.\" Job 42:16. For\\nperspective Abraham lived a total of 175 years so 140 is just 35 years\\nshort of Abraham\\'s entire lifetime. Jacob lived 147 years or just seven\\nyears longer than Job\\'s years following his ordeal. Next it says \"[He] saw\\nhis sons, and his sons\\' sons, four generations.\" Job 42:16. The first\\ngeneration would be those seven sons and three daughters. If Job recovered\\nhis health over the next ten years, he would have begun fathering/begetting\\nchildren ten years into the second 140 years. At the standard rate of\\ngaining maturity at the age of 32, the second generations would have begun\\n42 years into Job\\'s 2<sup>nd</sup> 140 years. The third generation would\\nhave begun when he was 74 years into the second 140. Finally, the fourth\\ngeneration would have begun when he was 106 years into the second 140\\nyears. This is about right mathematically because at 140, the first of the\\nfifth generation would have just been born.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWouldn\\'t this also have been true before his ordeal? If so, the first\\ngeneration would be 32-50 years younger than him making him begin the first\\ngeneration when he was 32, the second when he was 64, the third when he was\\n96 and the fourth when he was 128. Being 140 years old at the time of his\\nordeal fits while being 70 does not.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nFurthermore, the only activity mentioned of his first batch of ten children\\nis \"eating and drinking,\" and \"feasting.\" They held feasts in the house of\\neach one on his day and their sisters would join them (Job 1:4). The feasts\\nlasted for multiple days and Job was not present because the text says\\n\"When the days of the feast had run their course, Job would send and\\nconsecrate them&#8230;. Thus Job did continually.\" Job 1:5. This lifestyle\\nsounds more geared to retired or semi-retired people. Yet if he was only\\n70, the oldest would have been 38 while the youngest would have been 20\\nmeaning that most of them had not even reached adulthood. But if he were\\n140 when they were killed, the oldest would have been 108 and the youngest\\n90.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe servant who brought the terrible news called them young people: \"their\\noldest brother\\'s house &#8230; fell on the young people and they are dead.\"\\nJob 1:18-19. \"Young people\" is a relative term, frequently used by an older\\ngeneration for the next generation regardless of age. If they were 90-108\\nand Job was 140, \"young people\" would be appropriate. Further, they were\\nnot living with their parents any longer. Each owned his own home and ran\\nhis own life. Thus, his children\\'s easy lifestyle adds further support to\\nthe idea that Job had lived many more than 70 years and his first ten\\nchildren were far older than 20-38 when Satan struck.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSome will dismiss this line of reasoning as speculative but it logically\\napplies the pattern given by Scripture and it is such specific patterns as\\nfound in all the numbers in the lines of Adam and Shem that make the\\nScripture believable, not mythical.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Support for 280 Years from the Circumstances of His Death</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nFinally, Scripture concludes its elaboration on his years by stating the\\ncircumstances of his death: \"And Job died, an old man, and full of days.\"\\nJob 42:17. These words are standard statements in Scripture for living a\\nfull life rather than a life cut short prematurely or unusually extended.\\nHis 140 years were not miracle years other than being restored to health so\\nhe could live the standard lifetime of his day. Abraham\\'s death received\\nthe same Scriptural notice:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    <sup>7</sup>\\nThese are the days of the years of Abraham\\'s life, 175 years.        <sup>8</sup>Abraham breathed his last and died in a good old age, an\\n    old man and full of years. Genesis 25:7-8.\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAn entirely separate line of reasoning involves the hints of many years\\nbefore his ordeal. The book shows he knew much about God. He also was\\ncareful in his worship of God, always consecrating his sons and daughters\\nafter each round of their feasting (Job 1:4-5). Of all people God chose him\\nto expose the unseen enemy of mankind. All this suggests many years of\\nspiritual growth. The size of his ranch suggests he had been at it for a\\nlong time. His position of highest respect in the nearby town suggests the\\npassing of many years. The discourses ask if he were so old he knew all\\nthings. The very fact that the spiritual leaders of his area came to\\ncomfort him suggests that he had been around a long time. Job\\'s 280 year\\nlifespan is but the first of many reasons to place his birth half a\\nmillennium before Abraham\\'s. (See Appendix 11.1 for a list of fourteen\\nreasons for dating Job early.)\\n</p>\\n<p align=\"center\">\\n<strong>Job\\'s Character and World</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    <sup>1</sup>\\n    There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job, and that man was\\nblameless and upright, one who feared God and turned away from evil.<sup>2</sup>There were born to him seven sons and three daughters.        <sup>3</sup>He possessed 7,000 sheep, 3,000 camels, 500 yoke of oxen,\\n    and 500 female donkeys, and very many servants, so that this man was\\n    the greatest of all the people of the east. Job 1:1-3.\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThis opening paragraph introduces Job as a man without blame. Not that he\\nwas sinless, but as people looked at his life, they recognized qualities\\nlike honesty, justice and compassion. Upright comes from straight or\\ncorrect. It answers to righteousness. Job had a high regard for God and\\nwalked according to His standards.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe words describing Job\\'s character are in the very first verse of this\\nsixth longest Old Testament book. But they are repeated and they come from\\nthe very mouth of God when God says to Satan, \"Have you considered my\\nservant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a blameless and\\nupright man, who fears God and turns away from evil?\" Job 1:8. This time\\nGod adds that Job is at the top of the ladder, in a class all by himself,\\nthat there was none like him on the earth. Job was the most righteous man\\nalive in his day.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThat is not all. After Satan had destroyed all of Job\\'s wealth and caused\\nall ten of his children to perish, God repeated the phrase: \"Have you\\nconsidered my servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a\\nblameless and upright man, who fears God and turns away from evil? He still\\nholds fast his integrity, although you incited me against him to destroy\\nhim without reason.\" Job 2:3. In the face of losing all his possessions and\\nten kids, he retained his integrity. In spite of this crushing blow he was\\nstill in a class all of his own. None was like him in living the way God\\nintended man to live.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe suffering Job endured is so horrible that some feel his account is more\\nof an allegory, a story designed to teach God\\'s children to trust Him in\\nthe worst that could be imagined. No human could possible survive that,\\ngoes this thinking. Yet he is mentioned as a real person in both the Old\\nand New Testaments. James 5:11 speaks of his exemplary patience.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIn Ezekiel 14:14 and 20 God emphasizes how certain was the coming judgment\\nby saying to Ezekiel, \"Even if these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were\\nin it [the land God was judging], they would deliver but their own lives by\\ntheir righteousness, declares the Lord God.\" In verse 20 God repeats this\\nstatement with an oath: \"As I live declares the Lord God. They would\\ndeliver neither son nor daughter. They would deliver but their own lives by\\ntheir righteousness.\" Both Noah and Daniel are regarded as men who really\\nlived. In fact Daniel was alive when God gave this prophecy to Ezekiel.\\nThis certainly argues that like Noah and Daniel, Job was a real person. The\\nexperience of Job is more than a moral lesson. It is a record of events\\nthat actually happened.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Job\\'s Family Business</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe next verses describe his enormous ranch, large family and active\\nworship of the true God. Verse three mentions 500 yoke of oxen, 500\\ndonkeys, 7000 sheep, 3000 camels, very many servants and summarizes: \"This\\nman was the greatest of all the people of the east.\" The numbers are\\nimpressive. For instance if his 3000 camels were roped at 25\\' intervals,\\nthe caravan would stretch over 14 miles. More seriously, not many today are\\nfamiliar with how such animals could be employed to make Job the wealthiest\\nman \"in the east.\" So let us look at the operation and size of such a ranch\\non the basis of general standards of production for these animals.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nEssentially Job owned an enormous family business complex consisting of\\nthree major divisions: farming, manufacturing and trading. Each\\ncomplimented the other and made maximum use of his work force. The work\\nyear began with spring planting. One ox can pull a plow. A yoke of two\\nprovide both power and endurance. The man wrestling with the plow would\\nwear out long before two oxen. But someone needed to make sure the oxen\\nstayed on course, so one man would lead them while the other muscled the\\nplow. When the plow man became exhausted, they would trade jobs. Following\\nthem would be people to break up clods and smooth the dirt. Last of all\\nwould come the planters.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Division One: Farming</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nDuring planting season most of Job\\'s available community chipped in,\\nessentially moving into the field. Each yoke involved a family or two,\\npossibly a total of ten people including women and older children. Thus\\n5000 people would make the greatest use of Job\\'s 500 yoke of oxen. Being a\\ngodly man, Job would make sure his workers had a day of rest. Then time was\\nneeded to set up field camps where the oxen plowed. Most of the area was\\ncomposed of rather narrow valleys or bands of fertile soil broken up by\\nnumerous rocky hills, plateaus, mountainous regions and wilderness.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nNow it becomes obvious why the donkeys were needed. They brought both\\nprovisions to the field camp(s), sometimes as far as 20 miles from\\nheadquarters and supplies for planting. The various crops were planted at\\ndifferent times. Possibly the planting season extended over ten weeks which\\nallowed for about 50 plowing days after subtracting the days for moving,\\nrest and bad weather. If each yoke plowed two acres a day, 500 yoke would\\nplow 1000 acres a day or 50,000 in 50 days. A square mile contains 640\\nacres, so 50,000 acres amounts to 78 square miles.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWhen the Sabeans stole Job\\'s oxen (Job 1:15), the donkeys were feeding\\nbeside them. Apparently, Job practiced crop rotation, leaving a portion of\\nthe fertile land to rest each year. The oxen fed on this resting land at\\nnight and during the non-plowing season as well. Manure from the animals\\nfurther enriched the fallowing soil for its next cycle of planting. Because\\nthe area was becoming more arid, possibly one-third of Job\\'s total arable\\nland rested each year. Adding this land to the land being plowed brings the\\ntotal land that could be cultivated to 100 plus square miles.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nCrops matured for harvest at different times as well, so harvesting also\\nlasted for about two months. Again, all available personnel were needed for\\nthe harvest. During the harvest season donkeys carried loads in both\\ndirections-taking provisions out to the field workers and returning with\\nthe harvested crops.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Division Two: Manufacturing</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWool from Job\\'s 7000 sheep would supply his manufacturing division as well\\nas provide meat for his employees and sacrifices for worshiping the LORD.\\nPossibly ten garments could be made from the spring shearing of each\\nanimal. While keeping the sheep involved about 300 men and older boys, more\\nhelp would be needed at shearing time. When the women weren\\'t in the field\\nfor planting or harvesting, they would be making garments (70,000 a year\\nfrom 7000 sheep). Many would clothe Job\\'s community; the rest would be\\navailable for trade.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Division Three: Trading</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nJob\\'s 3000 camels explain his great wealth. They formed his trading\\ndivision, carrying his farming surplus and manufacturing products\\nthroughout the region. They would have been resting during planting and\\nharvesting while all available hands were involved in those efforts. During\\nthe trading season each caravan might involve ten to twenty camels, 150-300\\ncaravans. Each twenty-camel caravan consisted of camel drivers, skilled\\ntraders and guards, possibly ten men. While camels can walk all day at four\\nmiles per hour, to save their energy for carrying products, the men with\\nthem did not ride; they walked except, per chance, for a few elderly,\\nhighly skilled traders. Those walking limited the caravan to 20-25 miles a\\nday.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nDuring the trading season about 2000 of the men of Job\\'s ranch including\\nmost of the strongest men were involved in caravan operations. Another 300\\ncared for the sheep, 200 cared for the donkeys and oxen and still hundreds\\nof others provided services for the ranching community and mansions of Job\\nand his seven semi-retired sons. Possibly 3000 working age men were a part\\nof Job\\'s operation. With retirees, women and children, his entire community\\ncould have numbered 12,000.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nJob\\'s operations stretched over 1000 square miles, given all the unusable\\nland within which he found 100 square miles suitable for farming and\\nanother 50 for the grazing of sheep and camels. The area of his land\\ncompares favorably with the famous King Ranch of Texas, USA with its 1300\\nsquare miles.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Social Life of Job\\'s Adult Children</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nEach of Job\\'s seven sons had his own house. With Job at 140, his sons would\\nbe around 100 and have children, grandchildren and even great\\ngrandchildren. \"His sons used to go and hold a feast in the house of each\\none on his day, and they would send and invite their three sisters to eat\\nand drink with them.\" Job 1:4. \"His day\" is commonly understood to be the\\nbirthday of each son. \"And when the days of the feast had run their course,\\nJob would send and consecrate them, and he would rise early in the morning\\nand offer burnt offerings according to the number of them all.\" Job 1:5.\\n\"Days of the feast\" and \"run their course\" sounds like multiple days for\\neach feast and cycles of celebrating. It could be that \"his day\" was a\\ndesignated day on the calendar like the first day of each new moon or the\\nfirst day of each quarter to kick off another cycle of feasting at each\\nbrother\\'s house.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Priestly Function of Job</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nFollowing each cycle, regardless of their frequency, Job diligently\\nperformed the service of family priest, consecrating each son and offering\\na burnt sacrifice for each. The idea that he was very conscientious in this\\nexpression of faith is reinforced with \"Thus Job did continually.\" Job 1:5.\\nSo even though his vast business operation undoubtedly kept him very busy,\\nhe was not too busy to find time to worship God. What previous men of faith\\nhad learned of God was available in Job\\'s day and on the basis of this\\nverbal Bible Job had established a strong trust in God.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe next section will provide numerous further reasons to conclude Job was\\nborn nearly 300 years before Peleg rather than 400-1200 years after Peleg.\\nWhile it would not seem so, the location of Job\\'s ranch is a significant\\nelement in determining when Job was born.\\n</p>\\n<p align=\"center\">\\n<strong>Location of Job\\'s Ranch</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThat very first verse also tells where he lived: \"There was a man in the\\nland of Uz whose name was Job&#8230;\" So, who was Uz and where was his land\\nlocated? Determining all this takes some detective work but many clues are\\navailable to provide a reasonable answer. One Uz is found among the\\nearliest people in the line of Shem. Shem had a son named Aram who fathered\\na son named Uz. This Uz is found in both the genealogies of the Table of\\nNations and those in Chronicles.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    The sons of Shem: Elam, Asshur, Arpachshad, Lud, and Aram. The sons of\\n    Aram: Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash. Genesis 10:22-23.\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    The sons of Shem: Elam, Asshur, Arpachshad, Lud, and Aram. And the sons\\n    of Aram: Uz, Hul, Gether, and Meshech. I Chronicles 1:17.\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAram was among those born in the first generation after the Flood; thus his\\nson Uz was born in the second. Further, Uz was Aram\\'s firstborn. While\\nthese are obvious facts, they are extremely important and must not be\\noverlooked. They mean he was on the ground floor in obtaining land in the\\nyears after the population scattered following the Tower of Babel judgment.\\nHis father must have taken his family west because his descendants, the\\nAramaeans, came to occupy portions of modern Syria, Jordan and western\\nArabia. As the firstborn, Uz received choice land-much of what is today\\nJordan and western Saudi Arabia. A substantial population developed across\\nthis region and a millennium later Job was born. He possessed a large\\namount of land, had incredible business skills, was commendably godly, and\\nattracted thousands of folks to his ranching enterprise. He exhibited the\\nbest qualities of the Shem-Aram-Uz line.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Godliness, Sunrise, Chaldeans, Sabeans and Camels </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBesides the person for whom the land was named, many other clues help\\nlocate Job\\'s ranch. God says Job was \"blameless and upright, one who feared\\nGod and turned away from evil.\" Job 1:1b. Like his ancestor Noah who lived\\na thousand years before, Job was a spiritual beacon in his day. Very\\npossibly Noah\\'s Shem-Aram-Uz branch remained true to Noah\\'s God during this\\nentire period. Each of the five men who spoke in Job came from different\\npeople groups yet were descendants of Aram or influenced by Aram\\'s\\ndescendants. How else to explain their sound knowledge of God?\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAnother geographical clue is found in Job 1:3: \"He was the greatest of all\\nthe people of the east.\" The word \"east\" is \"sunrise.\" Directions were in\\nrelation to Israel. But since Abraham did not enter Canaan until half a\\nmillennium later, how can this phrase be explained? The answer lies in the\\nwork of the Holy Spirit who led the editor/writer to include this in the\\nbook\\'s final form. This statement locates Job\\'s ranch more to the east of\\nIsrael rather than to the north as in Syria or to the south as in the\\nSinai.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe assaults of the Sabeans for Job\\'s oxen (Job 1:15) and Chaldeans for\\nJob\\'s camels (Job 1:17) point to a west to northwest Arabia location. The\\nSabeans were famous marauding nomads from the depths of the Arabian\\nwilderness to the east. As to the Chaldeans the servant was very specific.\\nTheir style was distinctive; they were well organized; they executed their\\nattack military style. Clearly, they were well known in Job\\'s day. In later\\ntimes they occupied a land north of Mesopotamia so they either migrated\\nnorth over the centuries from where they lived in this early period or this\\nwas a splinter group. This might place Job\\'s ranch more to the northern\\nportion of the land of Uz.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nCamels are another clue to where and when Job lived. While donkeys were\\nused for local transport, camels carried goods long distances. The camel\\ndoes not have a hoof. Instead, it is equipped with a large leathery pad\\nthat prevents it from sinking into the sand. Their long legs distanced them\\nfurther from the hot earth than the legs of donkeys or horses so they were\\nbetter fitted for hot desert temperatures. They could walk for days between\\nwatering spots. As will be seen later, Arabia was covered with vegetation\\ndue to hypercyclones until the waning days of the Ice Age. As the Ice Age\\ncame to an end and desert regions increased, camels became the standard\\npack animals.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nJob spoke of the caravans of Sheba and Tema. The countries of Sheba, home\\nto the Queen of Sheba in southwestern Arabia and Tema which was NW of Sheba\\nwere famous for trading all across Arabia. Job would have been very\\nfamiliar with them and their countless trading routes. His 3000 camels\\nwould also have been familiar sights across much of Arabia. This places Job\\non the fringe of the Arabian desert where he could still farm successfully\\nbut also trade in the desert regions to the east.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Other References to \"the Land of Uz\"</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nVery important clues come from the other two times the land of Uz is\\nmentioned in the Old Testament. Both references are found in the writings\\nof Jeremiah which date two millennia after Job\\'s ordeal. By that time\\nnations had formed in parts of the land of Uz so they help to identify the\\nentire region of Uz. In Jeremiah 25:15-26 God directs the prophet to make\\nthe nations drink the cup of His judgment. This judgment consists of defeat\\nin warfare. Many nations and kingdoms are in this passage. The list,\\nhowever, contains an order. It begins and ends with the two nations that\\ntreated Israel the worst-Egypt and Babylon who were the first and last to\\nbe judged by God. But it also seems to be a listing of nations from closest\\nto Israel to those more distant. The following is an attempt to pick out\\nthe names of the nations without citing the entire content of these twelve\\nverses:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    <sup>15</sup>\\n    Thus the LORD, the God of Israel, said to me \"Take from my hand this\\n    cup of the wine of wrath, and make all the nations to whom I send you\\ndrink it:\" <sup>18</sup>Jerusalem and the cities of Judah;        <sup>19</sup>Pharaoh king of Egypt, his servants, his officials, all\\n    his people, <sup>20</sup>and all the mixed tribes among them; all the\\n    kings of the land of Uz and all the kings of the land of the\\nPhilistines, <sup>21</sup>Edom, Moab, and the sons of Ammon;        <sup>22</sup>all the kings of Tyre, all the kings of Sidon, and all the\\nkings of the coastland across the sea; <sup>23</sup>Dedan, Tema, Buz;        <sup>24</sup>all the kings of Arabia and all the kings of the mixed\\n    tribes who dwell in the desert, <sup>25</sup>all the kings of Zimri,\\n    all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of Media; <sup>26</sup>all the\\n    kings of the north, far and near, one after another, and all the\\n    kingdoms of the world. After them the king of Babylon shall drink.\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nGod begins with Jerusalem and Judah, the heart of Israel. Then come the\\nbordering countries of Uz, Philistia, Edom, Moab, Ammon, Tyre and Sidon.\\nPhilistia bordered Israel on her southwest; Edom, Moab and Ammon were those\\nsmall nations that bordered her on her south and east. Tyre and Sidon were\\nthe small people groups immediately to Israel\\'s northwest. The list\\nconcludes with countries more distant from Israel-the coastlands, Dedan,\\nTema, Buz, Arabia, the desert, Zimri, Elam and Media.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nRemarkably when this list gets into specific geographical regions bordering\\nIsrael, the very first area is Uz. The next nations were to Israel\\'s\\nsouthwest, south, southeast, east and northwest, leaving only her north and\\nnortheast for Uz. Damascus representing Syria to her north is absent from\\nthis list which suggests that Damascus had already been conquered by\\nBabylon. The only region left for Uz is the northeast border of Israel.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nLamentations 4:21 confirms the above: \"Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of\\nEdom, you who dwell in the land of Uz.\" Jacob\\'s twin brother Esau founded a\\nnation called Edom and Edom occupied an area SE to SW of the Dead Sea which\\nwas at least partly in the area of ancient Uz. In a similar way Moab and\\nAmmon, the sons of Lot, established nations that occupied portions of\\nancient Uz on Israel\\'s eastern border. The only remaining portion of Uz not\\nspecifically occupied by a nation in Jeremiah\\'s day was the northeast\\nborder of Israel. Thus, the land of Uz in Job\\'s day occupied an area from\\nnortheast to south of the Israel of Jeremiah\\'s day. Job\\'s ranch could have\\nbeen located anywhere within this large territory.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nOutside of the book of Job, of all the biblical writers Jeremiah alone\\nnames ancient Uz as a land. For Jeremiah to think in terms of that area\\'s\\nname found in just five words of previous Scripture [\"in the land of Uz\"]\\nsuggests the book of Job was a prominent source of his thinking about God.\\nIt would be a fascinating meditation for someone to dwell on how the book\\nof Job contributed to Jeremiah\\'s faith.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Conclusion</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIn summary Job lived somewhere in Uz, somewhere east of Israel, somewhere\\nthat was vulnerable to the Sabeans of the desert and Chaldeans from some\\ndistant place, somewhere where his caravans could trade throughout Arabia,\\nsomewhere where he could have traveled to the Jordan River to see Behemoth,\\nsomewhere where lakes still froze fast, where hail and snow were common,\\nand where windstorms might level the strongest houses.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nJob lived in the transition from the Ice Age to the post Ice Age period,\\nthe subject of chapter 11. He lived before Arabia became unfarmable desert.\\nNumerous indications point to an area northeast of Israel, somewhere in\\nnorthern Jordan or northwest Arabia, several hundred miles east of the\\nMediterranean. As a descendant of Uz this was the portion of land he\\nreceived and where he made his home in the waning centuries of the Ice Age.\\n</p>\\n<br clear=\"all\"/>\\n\\n'},Xe={html:'<p align=\"center\">\\n<strong>Chapter Ten</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p align=\"center\">\\n<strong>Evidence from the Message of Job for Missing Generations</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nFor a host of reasons some already stated in chapter nine, the Book of Job\\nsupports the view that Shem\\'s genealogy omits names. This chapter begins\\nwhere God tells Job to recall his watching of the greatest land creature,\\nthe dinosaur Behemoth, in the Jordan Valley. That certainly happened many\\ncenturies before Abraham. But Behemoth was just one step in the goal of\\nrecording the book\\'s essential message for mankind.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWe are told in the opening two chapters of Job that Satan caused Job\\'s\\nsuffering. But far earlier, in the first chapter of the Bible we read\\nwithout elaboration that God created the great sea monster and set him\\napart from all other animals. In Job 41 God finally elaborates on this king\\nof pride who struck terror into the heart of man above all other creatures.\\nBy this we learn that God created him to picture the menace of Satan and\\nfor this elaborate warning to stand forever in the oldest book of the\\nBible.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAs to timing, Job himself was born eight or nine generations before Peleg,\\nthe fourth named generation of Shem\\'s descendants born after the Flood. Job\\nlived in the waning years of the great Ice Age, long gone and forgotten by\\nthe days of the Patriarchs. In restoring Job who said God hated him, God\\nspoke of His creation with more words than in Genesis. Why? Creation showed\\nhow good and kind God was to Job. With this matter settled God was free to\\nreveal the real source of Job\\'s suffering by speaking of Leviathan, the\\ndivine picture of Satan.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Behemoth and Leviathan</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nFor 44 verses in Job 40 and 41 our Creator speaks of the two enormous\\nreptilian creatures mentioned above: Behemoth, a powerfully-built,\\nlong-tailed land creature and Leviathan, a vicious sea monster of\\ntremendous strength that stood at the apex of the animal kingdom.\\nCommentaries of the church fathers, those of the Reformation and even most\\ntoday identify Behemoth as a hippopotamus or elephant and Leviathan as a\\nsea crocodile or whale. After all, those were the largest land and sea\\ncreatures somewhat fitting God\\'s description that they knew. Not anymore.\\nToday the world\\'s museums are stuffed with the fossilized bones of great\\nland and sea creatures that were buried and preserved in the muds of the\\nGreat Flood. Sea creatures in the Flood\\'s cooler ocean regions and young\\ndinosaurs on the Ark enabled both types to survive the Flood and grow in\\npopulation until humans squeezed them out.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBut why speak to Job about these two impressive creatures when Job had\\nwasted away to skin and bones, enduring the worst imaginable suffering for\\nperhaps a year? Wouldn\\'t God comfort Job and explain his pain? In truth He\\ndid. The creation lecture showed that God was kind and good while those\\nmonsters pointed to the real cause of Job\\'s suffering. It did not come from\\nGod but from the evil personage the sea monster depicted-the leader of the\\nfallen angels who desires to see every man share his misery in hell\\nforever.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBible commentators with their incorrect interpretations of Behemoth and\\nLeviathan have muted Scripture\\'s purpose in exposing Satan\\'s sinister\\ncharacter and ignored God\\'s use of the analogy. This chapter presents four\\nHebrew nouns used in the Old Testament to represent this creature and the\\nfrightening character it was designed to portray. Then it will explore the\\nangelic rebellion which required the creation of Leviathan. God\\'s exchange\\nwith Satan follows. All of this argues for many omitted names in Shem\\'s\\nlist.\\n</p>\\n<p align=\"center\">\\n<strong>Four Hebrew Nouns for the Sea Monster</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Hebrew Noun #1-Tannin</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    So God created [<em>bar\\'ah</em>] great sea creatures [<em>tannin</em>].\\n    Genesis 1:21.\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nGod created the animal kingdom on days five and six of creation week. Of\\nall those animals, He named only one-the great sea creature. The Hebrew\\nword is <em>tannin</em>. Here the plural form of the noun is used,\\nindicating God created many of them just as He caused the waters to swarm\\nwith fish (Genesis 1:20). The adjective <em>great</em> further\\ndistinguishes this creature from all others. It forms a Hebrew grammatical\\nconstruction that emphasizes the adjective and can be rendered \"the sea\\ncreatures, the great ones.\"\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nTo further focus on this creature, God placed him first in a new wave of\\ndivine creative activity. The Hebrew verb used here is <em>bar\\'ah</em>\\nwhich specifically means \"to create.\" It is only found three times in the\\ncreation account. Otherwise, the two more general verbs, \"to make\" and \"to\\nform\" are used to describe God\\'s work of creation. The other two uses of    <em>bar\\'ah</em> are without question major acts of creation. It is used for\\nthe creation of the material universe in verse one and for the creation of\\nman in verse 27.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nYet, here in verse 21 <em>bar\\'ah</em> is used for the creation of living\\nthings that had an immaterial component. Whereas plants created on day\\nthree have life, creatures created on days five and six of creation week\\nhave some kind of a mind or immaterial component and this higher level of\\nlife warranted the primary word for creating. The leading creature in this\\ncategory was the great sea monster. A literal translation would read: \"And\\nElohim created the sea creatures, that is, the great ones.\" The NKJV and\\nESV render tannin \"sea creature\" here while the NASV uses \"sea monster.\"\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nCertainly, the creation of creatures was insignificant in comparison with\\nthe creation of the physical universe and man. Yet, here it stands-their\\ncreation set apart with the universe and man. Could it be that God used    <em>bar\\'ah</em> specifically to raise questions about the only named\\ncreature in this category of life? Yet Genesis 1:21 provides no further\\ndetails about him. In this way it seems that God established an open door\\nto speak of him at a later time. At the end of creation week God saw all He\\nmade and it was very good; while enormous, the great sea creature was not\\nmenacing. The fall of man marred all of God\\'s creation and the sea creature\\nbecame the most fearsome of animals.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nHebrew nouns often express characteristics of the thing they name.    <em>Tannin</em> literally means \"long-stretched\" and in its primary form,\\nthe three consonant verb form means \"to stretch.\"    <a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\" title=\"\"><sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup></a> It\\nis found fifteen times in the Old Testament. Five times it is used for a\\nsnake (serpent). Aaron threw down his staff and it became a <em>tannin</em>\\n. Deuteronomy 32:33 and Psalm 91:13 also use <em>tannin</em> in the sense\\nof snake. Being a creature that appears to be stretched out because it is\\nlong and narrow, snakes were miniature versions of the great sea creature.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIn the psalmist\\' day, four hundred years after Moses compiled Genesis,\\nScripture repeats the creation pattern, using the sea creature to represent\\nthe animal kingdom. Psalm 148 is one of the \"Praise the LORD\" psalms. The\\nfirst six verses call on angels, sun, moon and stars to praise the Lord.\\nVerse seven turns to things on earth; the first thing mentioned is the sea\\ncreature (<em>tannin</em>). \"Praise the LORD from the earth, you great sea\\ncreatures [<em>tannin</em>, in the plural form] and all deeps.\" Psalm\\n148:7. This verse would be referring to sea monsters as living marine\\ncreatures, not analogies to Satan, but it does show they still existed or\\nwere at least remembered even in the psalmist\\'s day.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe prophets used the sea creature to picture the two great nations that\\noppressed Israel. God addressed Pharaoh as a great dragon in Ezekiel 29:3:\\n\"Behold, I am against you, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great dragon [    <em>tannin</em>] that lies in the midst of his streams, that says, \\'My Nile\\nis my own, I made it for myself.\\'\" Three chapters later God tells the\\nprophet to \"say to Pharaoh King of Egypt: \\'You consider yourself a lion of\\nthe nations, but you are like a dragon [<em>tannin</em>] in the seas.\\'\"\\nEzekiel 32:2. The lion was highly admired, considered the most regal of\\nanimals. Pharaoh represented himself that way. But God said in reality he\\nwas like the dragon (<em>tannin</em>). While <em>tannin</em> was famous and\\npowerful, he was not considered noble. People dreaded the sea monster. He\\nhad a reputation for being dangerous, sinister and evil, certainly not the\\nreputation Pharaoh sought.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nComparison with the sea monster was similarly used for Babylon:\\n\"Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon has devoured me [Judah]&#8230; he has\\nswallowed me like a monster [<em>tannin</em>] [swallows its victim].\"\\nJeremiah 51:34. Babylon had gobbled up Judah with the same ease that a    <em>tannin</em> gobbled up its victims.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Hebrew Noun #2-Leviathan (Job 41:1)</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nGod chose the ordeal of Job to answer the many questions about the sea\\ncreature of Genesis 1:21. Job had charged that God was treating him\\nunfairly, attacking him like an enemy. He demanded an audience with God so\\nhe could make his case. After Job\\'s three friends and a young theologian\\nfalsely accused him of grievous sins, God appeared in a powerful whirlwind\\nwhich established a commanding presence. But He did not bring a crying\\ntowel, nor did He sympathize with Job or even mention Job\\'s suffering. Most\\nimportantly, He did not appear to be grilled by Job. Rather, He began: \"Who\\nis this that darkens counsel by words without knowledge? Dress for action\\nlike a man; I will question you and you make it known to me.\" Job 38:2-3.\\nIt was Job who needed further enlightenment and not the other way around.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSo God would do the questioning and Job would do the answering. God\\'s\\nsubject was His creation which testified that He was good, that He\\nsustained it, that He had filled man\\'s habitat with the fruit of His\\ngoodness and specifically that He had blessed Job through it. Therefore,\\nGod was not Job\\'s enemy and had not caused him to suffer. Job was\\nspeechless.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nTwo important truths need to be recognized at this point. The questions God\\nasked were a universe beyond the learning of Job\\'s day which assures us\\nthat the Creator of the physical universe Himself was asking them. Answers\\nto many of God\\'s scientific questions have only been learned in recent\\nyears; others still elude today\\'s most advanced science. Mankind did not\\nhave this knowledge 2550 years before Christ. If these questions had been\\ncomposed by man as unbelievers charge, they would reflect the same bad\\nscience and even anti-science expressed in the writings of the ancients.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAlso, we must recognize how pleased God was (and is) with the\\ntime-space-matter creation He made. God is more than boasting here, He is\\nraving. If we ever wished to hear the Creator discuss His creation of the\\nuniverse, the earth and living things at length, we have such a record\\nright here in Job 38-41. These four chapters contain more than the entire\\nbook of Genesis or any other portion of Scripture on creation. Engineers\\nknow the difficulty of designing something that works correctly. God speaks\\nof many inanimate and living things and they all work with breath-taking\\nprecision.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSo then, if God was not the source of Job\\'s suffering, what explained his\\nordeal? After questions about the physical and animal world, God spent the\\nlast 44 verses on the greatest land and sea creatures. Ten verses are\\ndevoted to Behemoth which by the testimony of God was the greatest land\\ncreature (Job 40:19)-a dinosaur with a long neck, long, powerful tail,\\nbones like tubes of bronze and limbs like bars of iron (Job 40:18). All the\\nland dinosaurs did not perish in the Flood. One pair of each kind was\\npreserved on the Ark to repopulate the world after the Flood. Since many\\nreptiles grow all their lives it would have been unnecessary to take full\\ngrown specimens on the Ark. God would have sent a young Behemoth pair. Over\\na millennium later Job watched these giant monsters in the Jordan Valley.\\nWhile they were gone by the day of Abraham, they were still living in Job\\'s\\nday.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>King over All the Sons of Pride. Job 41:1-34.</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBehemoth was not at the top of the monster ladder. God used him to lead up\\nto the most awesome of them all, the great sea creature Leviathan (Job\\n41:1). God devotes all 34 verses of Job 41 to this fearsome animal, the\\nsame number of verses found in the entire six-day creation account of\\nGenesis 1:1-2:3. They speak of his exceeding danger to humans but it was up\\nto Job to make the connection, that Leviathan represented the source of his\\ngrief.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nA Leviathan was almost impossible to kill. His size, armored exterior and\\nocean habitat gave him an enormous advantage over humans. By comparison man\\nhad limited maneuverability on or in the water. As to weapons at this time\\nman was still limited to his own strength or those powered by his own\\nstrength such as spears and arrows which were useless against Leviathan.\\nThus, people lived in mortal fear of these creatures. Job knew what God was\\ntalking about. He had nearly lost his life in some unexplained encounter\\nwith a Leviathan:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    Lay your hands on him; remember the battle-you will not do it again!\\n    Job 41:8\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nFrom this we learn that Job traveled extensively because he would have to\\njourney to one of the world\\'s oceans or large water bodies to have seen a\\nLeviathan unless Lake Lisan was connected to the Red Sea and a Leviathan\\noccasionally ventured up river to this large inland lake. In verse after\\nverse God describes the danger of trying to tangle with him (Job 41:7-10,\\n25-29). He terrified people by rising high in the water, then crashing down\\nwith all his weight (Job 41:25) causing some commentators to conclude he\\nwas a whale. Many ancient seamen described his aggression, even attacking\\nocean-going vessels. Job said, \"Am I a sea monster [<em>tannin</em>] that\\nyou set a guard over me\" (Job 7:12)? Job felt God was watching him with the\\nsame intensity people set a guard to watch for the sea monster\\'s presence\\nonce one was spotted in their area.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThis second Hebrew word for the sea monster (<em>Leviathan</em>,\\ncapitalized in English translations) is found six times in Scripture and is\\nthe one Hebrew word that only refers to this creature or the enemy he\\nrepresented. The Hebrew stem in its various forms connotes a wreath which\\nis something round and narrow; in the verb form, \"to twist, to surround;\"\\ntogether <em>tannin</em> and <em>Leviathan</em> suggest the twisting motion\\nof a crawling snake. Psalm 104:26 speaks of this serpent-like creature\\nliving in the open ocean: \"There go the ships and Leviathan, which you\\nformed to play in it.\" Some have concluded that Leviathan was a salt water\\ncrocodile which is an exceptionally large species of crocodile. However,\\nthose crocodiles lived in bays and other shallow bodies of salt water. They\\ndid not play where ships sailed on the high seas; neither would they remain\\nin plain sight when humans came along. Rather, they would slip away to hide\\nunder the water. On the other hand, Leviathan had no fear of humans so he\\ndid not hide when ships appeared. Most particularly, the sea crocodile was\\nnot the greatest of all creatures that ever lived as God says Leviathan\\nwas.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe cursing of the villagers at the arrival of a Leviathan was a fitting\\ncomparison to the intensity with which Job cursed the day of his birth.\\n\"Let those curse it [the day of his birth] who curse the day [Leviathan\\narrived in their bay], who are ready to rouse up Leviathan.\" Job 3:8. Their\\nchildren would not be safe on the shore or in the water with Leviathan\\naround so they had to drive him out of their bay or lagoon or move\\nsomewhere else until he left. But they cursed that day because in rousing\\nup Leviathan, some would be injured, some might die in the battle and all\\nwould be terrified.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nOne might wonder if the sea creature (<em>tannin</em>) of Genesis one is\\nthe same as Leviathan of Job 41. A complete word study makes this obvious\\nbut Psalm 74:13-14 provides a quick answer by using the two words\\nsynonymously. It is referring to the Red Sea event: \"You [God] divided the\\nsea by your might; you broke the heads of the <strong>sea monsters</strong>\\n[<em>tannin</em>] on the waters. You crushed the heads of    <strong>Leviathan</strong>; you gave him as food for the creatures of the\\nwilderness\" (emphasis ours). God parted the sea for Israel to pass, and\\nthen returned the waters to drown Pharaoh\\'s charioteers. The bodies of\\nsoldiers and horses washed up on the shore where carrion eating creatures\\nof the desert consumed them. There were no actual sea monsters in this\\nevent but both the words for sea monster and Leviathan are used for the\\nsame purpose, as analogies to describe just how frightening and lethal\\nPharaoh\\'s chariot army was.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAlthough ancient writings, including Ugarit (Babylonian) and Canaanite\\nliterature, give this creature mythical qualities, long before the\\ndistortions, on day five of creation week God created a real creature that\\nwas at the top of the animal world, the greatest of all His living earthly\\ncreatures. God concluded His words about Leviathan with that very picture.\\n\"On earth there is not his like [equal], a creature without fear. He sees\\neverything that is high; he is king over all the sons of pride.\" Job\\n41:33-34. Beyond question this creature was a real animal and well known to\\nJob and the people of his day.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Hebrew Nouns #3 and #4-Nachash and Rahab</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBesides <em>tannin</em> (Genesis 1:21) and Leviathan (Job 41:1) two other\\nHebrew nouns (<em>nachash</em> and <em>rahab</em>) are used for this\\ncreature. <em>Nachash</em> is the primary Hebrew word for snake. It is\\nfound in Genesis three where Satan used a snake to speak to Eve and trick\\nher into eating of the forbidden tree. It appears in Numbers 21 where\\npoisonous snakes bit the people and they died. God reversed their lethal\\nbites by having Moses fashion a bronze snake and mount it on a pole. By\\nlooking on the bronze snake whoever was dying from a snake bite would live.\\nA derivative of this word is the Hebrew word for copper and bronze. Many\\nsnakes have the glistening brown color of these metals. Various evil\\nconnotations arose from the shape and motion of the snake. A verb form of\\nthis word is used ten times in the Old Testament for practicing divination.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBecause of its long, narrow shape and twisting motion, <em>nachash</em> was\\nused twice for the sea creature. \"If they [the wicked] hide from my sight\\nat the bottom of the sea, there I will command the [sea] serpent [    <em>nachash</em>], and it shall bite them\" (Amos 9:3). Amos had previously\\nspoken of digging into Sheol or climbing to heaven to flee from God, so he\\nwas not talking about the bottom of a shallow bay. He was talking about the\\nbottom of the ocean, far below the diving capacity of the sea crocodile.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nJob talked about the power of God in chapter twenty-six. God stilled the\\nsea and by His wind cleared the sky. He pierced the fleeing serpent (    <em>nachash</em>) and shattered Rahab (the fourth Hebrew word for the sea\\nmonster) (Job 26:12-13). \"Rahab\" is always used as a proper noun in the Old\\nTestament but its various Hebrew forms convey a very specific meaning. The\\nmasculine noun meant \"storm, arrogance.\" As an adjective it meant \"proud,\\ndefiant.\" The verb form meant \"to act stormily, boisterously, arrogantly.\"\\nYears later the harlot of Jericho who hid the two Hebrew spies received\\nthis name. Rahab must have been a very assertive person even in her\\nmother\\'s womb. The word \"Rahab\" is also used six times in Scripture for\\nwhat the sea monster represented-those who act defiantly against God and\\nHis chosen people Israel. Four times it specifically refers to Egypt which\\nenslaved God\\'s chosen people. Their ways are likened to those of the sea\\nmonster.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBesides Job 26:12-13 several other passages use two or more of these words\\ntogether, showing they were synonymous. In Isaiah 51:9 Rahab and the sea\\ncreature (<em>tannin</em>) are used synonymously: \"Was it not you [the\\nLORD] who cut Rahab in pieces, who pierced the dragon [<em>tannin</em>]?\\nWas it not you who dried up the sea, the waters of the great deep, who made\\nthe depths of the sea a way for the redeemed to pass over?\"\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIsaiah is speaking of Israel crossing the Red Sea while Pharaoh\\'s pursuing\\narmy was lost in the sea. In his arrogance and defiance of God\\'s will\\n(Rahab-like characteristics), Pharaoh came with the might of a sea serpent\\n(<em>tannin</em>), but God easily pierced him and cut his army to pieces.\\nWhile <em>tannin</em>, <em>nachash</em> and Rahab had other uses, they\\ntogether with \"Leviathan\" are used in the Old Testament about twenty-five\\ntimes to develop an awareness of this intensely evil spiritual being God\\nwanted to warn man about.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAs revelation progressed God gave man more and more details about the\\ndangerous enemy Leviathan represented. Finally, Revelation 12:7-9 and\\n20:1-3 clearly refer to him as the great dragon, the ancient serpent, the\\ndevil and Satan and relate how God removes him in stages. Meanwhile, God\\nhas provided armor to protect the believer from the cosmic powers Satan\\ncommands but this armor must be appropriated.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    And the great dragon was thrown down, that ancient serpent, who is\\n    called the devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world-he was\\n    thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him.\\n    Revelation 12:9.\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    <sup>10</sup>\\nFinally, be strong in the Lord and in the strength of his might.        <sup>11</sup>Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to\\n    stand against the schemes of the devil. <sup>12</sup>For we do not\\n    wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the\\n    authorities, against the cosmic powers over this present darkness,\\n    against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places. Ephesians\\n    6:10-12.\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThus, God had a very special purpose for fixing this animal in people\\'s\\nminds. He designed this creature to represent the leader of the angelic\\nrebellion. As the most vicious and dangerous creature known to man, it\\nportrayed how harmful Satan is. In common speech it became a measure for\\nthe worst that man could imagine. Satan is \"our ancient foe who seeks to\\nwork us woe.\" But while Leviathan was the worst creature a person could\\nencounter, he was no match for God. The implication is that when Job didn\\'t\\nunderstand what was happening, he should have trusted God who has the\\ngreatest power-who is omnipotent. So the first chapter in the Bible singles\\nout this creature and the oldest book in the Bible goes into incredible\\ndetail as God Himself discusses its power and ability to harm.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Creation of Angels and Need for Leviathan</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nLong before this space-time-matter continuum God created a vast population\\nof spirits in His image. Because man was created a little lower than the\\nangels (Psalm 8:5; Hebrews 2:7), we can only imagine their fine minds,\\ngreat strength, powerful wills, beautiful worship and bonding friendships.\\nDid they all know each other&#8230; a billion or one hundred billion?\\nApparently, they had the opportunity and the capacity. But they were not\\nall similarly gifted. Some had greater capabilities and higher positions as\\nthey functioned in their divinely appointed duties. Then one became lifted\\nup with pride. Ezekiel 28:12-19, a prophecy with both an immediate and more\\ndistant application, tells what happened. This evil one set himself against\\nGod. Even worse he exalted himself and thought in his heart, \"I will set my\\nthrone on high&#8230;I will make myself like the Most High\" (Isaiah\\n14:13-14). He eventually persuaded a full third of the angelic population\\nto support him in his quest to sit on God\\'s throne (Revelation 12:4).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nGod loved each of the angels He created. With sorrow He exercised judgment.\\nTo our limited thinking the sentence was unbelievably harsh-incarceration\\nin the eternal fire (Matthew 26:41) especially prepared for these fallen\\nangels. Yet, while God\\'s sentence on Satan and his followers was pronounced\\nin eternity past, it is still to be executed. Instead, God created the\\nuniverse and man.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nGod marked the leader of these rebels with the name \"Satan\" which means\\nadversary. All would know that there were just two camps-God with His\\nforces and the adversary with his; good and evil; light and darkness. To\\nthis day the adversary and his minions have limited freedom to oppose God\\'s\\nwork (James 4:7; I Peter 5:8). Somehow the creation of man is a part of\\nGod\\'s ultimate dealing with Satan. Since Satan can\\'t touch God, he seeks to\\nharm this instrument of God that somehow is God\\'s tool to execute the\\nsentence pronounced long ago-hence, Leviathan. The book of Job brings this\\nout more than any other Scripture.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSome maintain that God created the angels as well as man during creation\\nweek and that Satan fell with a third of heaven\\'s population a short time\\nlater. Creating angels and man at the same time confuses the immaterial\\nwith the material. The space-time-matter creation of Genesis one was\\nphysical and material. Angels like God are immaterial, not physical and\\ntherefore not a part of God\\'s physical creation. God not only created\\nangels before the time that is measured in the physical universe but He and\\nHis angels shared much activity. Each of the angels had his place. Each\\nlearned to function in an orderly way. Each learned how to exalt God\\'s\\nthrone. If a comparison could be made to the human time-frame, it seems\\nthat far more time went by when God and His angels enjoyed each other than\\nhas gone on since God created Adam.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nHe idea that Satan fell after the creation of man introduces the bizarre\\nsituation of 1/3<sup>rd</sup> of heaven\\'s population being consigned to\\nhell just years after God created them. No. The heavenly population\\nsurrounded God for a vast time in eternity past learning their duties and\\nperfecting their worship before pride led Satan to gather a huge following\\nto challenge God and eventually be put on trial by God and sentenced to the\\nlake of fire. The whole idea comes from an over-literal reading of Genesis\\n1:31 which says \"God saw everything that he had made, and behold, it was\\nvery good.\" Unfortunately, \"everything\" is understood to be everything God\\never made rather than the subject of Genesis one which is the creation of\\nall things subject to the physical realm.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Satan\\'s First Attack on Mankind</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIn the preceding chapter we saw the consistent life of faith of the one God\\nchose to expose Satan\\'s twisted thinking about the Creator and his intense\\nhatred for mankind. After just those opening five verses, we entered the\\nvery presence of God. The veil that separates the physical universe from\\nthe highest heaven, the spiritual heaven of God\\'s abode, was parted briefly\\nthat we might learn of a conflict between God and the fallen angels and be\\nalerted to the mortal danger in which it places mankind.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWhen God created Adam, He established one prohibition: \"You may surely eat\\nof every tree of the garden, but of the tree of the knowledge of good and\\nevil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely\\ndie.\" Genesis 2:16-17. At a later time, the Tempter came and persuaded Eve\\nto eat from the forbidden tree. He must have swelled with glee and settled\\nback to watch the man and woman die. He thought he had thwarted God\\'s plan\\nbefore it even started. But God had far more in mind-a masterful plan to\\novercome man\\'s disobedience and provide hope and respite despite oceans of\\nsuffering caused by Satan.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAs God warned, when man broke the only prohibition He had given him, man\\ndid die. He died spiritually. This spiritual death was an immediate break\\nin the bond between God and man, an alienation, an invisible barrier that\\ncaused man to hide from God. Further, Adam\\'s disobedience triggered the\\nprinciple of entropy (progressive disorder/breaking down) throughout the\\nentire physical creation. It all began to go downhill. Further, man began\\nto die physically, a process that took some 900 years in Adam\\'s case. Along\\nthe way suffering was inherent.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nHere now in Job, the oldest book of the Bible, God reveals this conflict\\nmore fully than in all the rest of Scripture. He demonstrated early how\\nsinister, how cruel, how powerful, how hateful that adversary is towards\\nhis Maker and therefore toward man whom God created to share His heaven. In\\nJob God is delivering a message to the world of mankind He loves: \"Be\\nwarned. There is an adversary who works with all his cunning during your\\nentire lifetime to ruin you. He is trying to poison your soul just like he\\npoisoned his own soul and the souls of those who joined him. Only I and My\\nsalvation can deliver you from the adversary\\'s doom and destruction in\\neternal fire.\"\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAs Job opens, we enter the very presence of God on \"a day when the sons of\\nGod came to present themselves before the LORD and Satan also came among\\nthem.\" Job 1:6. Those who gathered were called \"the sons of God.\" Of all\\nhumans only Adam and Eve were directly created by God and thus can properly\\nbe called \"the sons of God\" in that special sense. However, all the angels\\nwere directly created by God. Thus, they bear the title, \"Sons of God.\"\\nHere God is conducting a mandatory assembly of all His angelic sons, both\\nthe holy and the fallen.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>The Questioning of Satan</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIn front of the entire angelic population God initiated a conversation with\\nSatan. In doing so He would give the angels another lesson in the wisdom of\\nHis ways. \"Have you considered my servant Job, that there is none like him\\non the earth, a blameless and upright man, who fears God and turns away\\nfrom evil?\" Job 1:8. What a contrast. Job diligently honored God, living in\\nthe light of all God had revealed by his day. Satan was the opposite, a\\ntotal rebel. The trap was bated. Satan took it-hook, line and sinker, so to\\nspeak:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    <sup>9</sup>\\n    Does Job fear God for no reason? <sup>10</sup>Have you not put a hedge\\n    around him and his house and all that he has on every side? You have\\n    blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in\\n    the land. <sup>11</sup>But stretch out your hand and touch all that he\\n    has and he will curse you to your face. Job 1:9-11.\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nGod provided salvation for man immediately after the Fall by teaching the\\nfirst parents to offer animal sacrifice, an exercise which unknowingly\\nembraced God\\'s lamb to come. Man could not earn salvation; he did not\\ndeserve salvation; God provided it in grace. Satan slammed God\\'s plan of\\ngrace, dismissing God\\'s salvation for man as a sham. Evil said light was\\ndarkness and darkness was light. \"Just remove your hedge and then you will\\nsee his true colors,\" challenged the Destroyer.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIn effect Satan charged that Job feared God because it paid, that God\\nbought His worshipers, and that Job didn\\'t truly love God. His worship was\\nmotivated by self-interest. Job was a hypocrite. Beyond this Satan was\\nsaying that God\\'s salvation for mankind doesn\\'t work, that His plan to\\nprovide redemption to those who were born spiritually dead due to Adam\\'s\\ndisobedience was a hoax. Further, Satan expressed his disdain and sneering\\ncontempt for God not in private but before the entire population of heaven.\\nThe hosts of heaven held their collective breathes. How would God reply?\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n[To pause and wonder: all of this at the beginning of the oldest book of\\nthe Bible. What a disclosure of high priority in God\\'s mind.]\\n</p>\\n<p align=\"center\">\\n<strong>The Attacks of Satan on Job</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>First Attack: Destruction of Job\\'s Possessions</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBefore that angelic assembly God as much as declared \"Let the contest\\nbegin. We will test your [Satan\\'s] contention. We will see if Job is a\\nphony or not. Here were the rules.\" \"All he has is in your hand. Only\\nagainst him do not stretch out your hand.\" Job 1:12. With that Satan rushed\\nout to orchestrate the senseless destruction of all Job had. Messengers\\narrived one after another from distant parts of the ranch to report 500\\nyoke of oxen, 500 donkeys, 7000 sheep, 3000 camels, the keepers and Job\\'s\\nten children-all gone. What a show of power and hate.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSatan brought the Sabeans of the desert to plunder the oxen and donkeys and\\nmurder or kidnap Job\\'s servants with them. In a distant region he caused\\nsome sort of natural disaster, possibly a lightning storm or pyroclastic\\nflow from an active volcano, to destroy the sheep and their keepers. From\\nbeyond the desert, he brought the Chaldeans for the camels. He caused a\\nfreak tornado to come from the wilderness and strike exactly when Job\\'s\\nchildren were celebrating on the day of his firstborn. This mayhem would\\nstand for all time as a grave illustration of Satan\\'s power on planet\\nearth.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAll heaven watched to see what Job would do next. Here is what they saw and\\nheard: <sup>20</sup>\"Then Job arose and tore his robe and shaved his head\\nand fell on the ground and worshiped. <sup>21</sup>And he said, \\'Naked I\\ncame from my mother\\'s womb, and naked shall I return. The LORD gave, and\\nthe LORD has taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD.\\'\" Job 1:20-21.\\nNext, we are given the divine commentary on Job\\'s response. \"In all this\\nJob did not sin or charge God with wrong.\" Job 1:22. The Adversary had been\\nwrong. Instead of cursing, Job did just the opposite, he blessed the LORD.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Second Attack: Destruction of Job\\'s Health</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nDestruction and death had come in Satan\\'s first attack. Job lost not only\\nfamily but longtime, trusted servants. In the following months with heavy\\nheart he cared for widows and orphans as he began rebuilding his ranch.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSometime later the Sons of God were again summoned to assemble before their\\nFather. Again the Adversary was singled out. God pointed out that Job\\n\"holds fast his integrity, although you incited me against him to destroy\\nhim without reason.\" Job 2:3. God actually said that He destroyed Job\\nwithout reason. Satan did not govern creation. God alone rules. God is\\nsovereign. No event happens without His permission.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe Accuser did not admit that he had accused Job falsely. He had taken a\\nchance. Maybe Job would crack. But the mental anguish and sense of\\nabandonment by God he caused hadn\\'t worked. Satan proposed to change the\\nrules of the game.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    <sup>4</sup>\\n\"Skin for skin! All that a man has he will give for his life.        <sup>5</sup>But stretch out your hand and touch his bone and his flesh,\\n    and he will curse you to your face.\" <sup>6</sup>And the LORD said to\\n    Satan, \"Behold, he is in your hand; only spare his life.\" Job 2:4-6.\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThis time Satan would resort to pain, the most intense he could inflict. No\\nneed to orchestrate Sabeans, Chaldeans, hails of fire and destructive wind.\\nSatan made a beeline for Job\\'s ranch in the land of Uz. But he had to be\\ncareful here. His attack must not be lethal or the contest would\\nimmediately be over. In fact God had specifically commanded Satan not to\\ntake Job\\'s life and Satan dared not defy God in the face of a direct\\ncommand. Satan \"went out from the presence of the LORD and struck Job with\\nloathsome sores from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head.\" Job\\n2:7.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nNow Job couldn\\'t even work. He was in constant pain. In time he lost weight\\nto the point where his bones showed. His skin turned black. The malady\\nchanged his appearance beyond recognition. It was visible for all to see\\nand considered a sign of God\\'s disapproval. People turned against him. Even\\nthe most despicable showed their contempt by spitting on or at him.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nUnder the duress of pain people say things they would not otherwise say.\\nGod knew Job\\'s worship was truly motivated by love for Him, not material\\nblessing. But the hosts of heaven, not even the Adversary with all his\\ngreat power, could see Job\\'s heart. This contest was for their sake, not\\nGod\\'s. As for God, He previously received Job\\'s worship and was exalted by\\nit. Now He was exalted by Job\\'s steadfastness while under intense\\nsuffering. Through months of physical pain Job did not curse God. Then it\\nwas time to conclude the contest. All heaven watched to see how God would\\nend it and restore Job.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSurprises never cease. God, of course, knew exactly what He would do. He\\nwould use this opportunity to give mankind an answer for undeserved\\nsuffering, the message for which the Book of Job is most remembered. But to\\nget it all out, the angels as well as future generations of mankind would\\nhave to know what was going on inside Job, what was going through his mind,\\nwhat was in his soul. Thus, God moved three of Job\\'s longtime friends,\\npossibly noted regional theological authorities like Job to make \"an\\nappointment to come to show him sympathy and comfort him.\" Job 2:11. They\\nwould end up having an all-day debate with him and in all these words\\neveryone would come to know what Job was thinking.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Finding Henry Morris\\' Book on Job</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nNow I must become personal. The reason will soon be evident. I certainly\\nwas fully committed to biblical inerrancy after two years at Multnomah\\nSchool of the Bible (now Multnomah University) in Portland Oregon. After\\ncompleting my undergraduate work at Wheaton College, my four years at\\nDallas Theological Seminary cemented my inerrancy conviction. When I\\nabandoned the gap theory through the teaching of Dr. Henry Morris II, 30\\nyears later, I entered the world of creation science-evidences for a young\\nearth.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAs my wife and I founded the Mount St. Helens 7Wonders Creation Museum in\\n1998, one of the early books we ordered for the new bookstore was Morris\\'\\nbook on Job. I was so impressed with it that over the next three years we\\nsold about 70 copies which may have made it our top selling book. In my\\nhands is my original copy with underlining and highlighting on nearly every\\npage. In November of 2000 I wrote that I had begun \"a careful study of the\\nbook.\" This would have been my second or third reading. In time you might\\nsay that of all the 66 books in the Bible, Morris\\' book caused me to\\nspecialize in the Book of Job. Now sixty-five years of biblical study\\nskills have been poured into Job.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nMorris showed that the purpose of Job was not undeserved suffering as most\\nexpositors taught; but as Dr. Harold Wilmington explained in the Foreword,\\nMorris felt it demonstrated God\\'s sovereignty to the heavenly population\\nand reemphasized the importance of God\\'s original creation.    <a href=\"#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\" title=\"\"><sup><sup>[2]</sup></sup></a>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nParents prioritize the training of their children. Some lessons are more\\nbasic than others and must be taught early on. Such is the Book of Job\\nwhere God graphically presents three foundational truths for understanding\\nHis heart and making sense of our existence. While each lesson reinforces\\nthe other two, here is how these lessons become obvious:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Lesson one. </strong>\\nGod is resolving the discord in heaven caused by the rebellious angels who\\nchallenged His government. This discord is obvious through God\\'s exchange\\nwith Satan (Job 1-2) and His analogy to Satan through Leviathan. It leads\\nto the second lesson which addresses suffering.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Lesson two. </strong>\\nMan is the innocent victim of this angelic warfare. He tries to make sense\\nof the suffering it causes, reasoning that God has the power to prevent or\\nremove it. But by leaving the fallen angels out of the equation, he ends up\\nwith the conclusion that somehow God is to blame for suffering. In doing so\\nman overlooks the fact that all suffering is produced either directly or\\nindirectly by those rebels. The dialogues of Job and his friends picture\\nhow mankind struggles with this issue.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Lesson three</strong>\\n. The physical creation is an exquisite and complex game board designed by\\nGod on which this conflict is played out. That God not only designed but\\nalso maintains it is sufficient evidence for mankind to trust Him\\ncompletely in what man cannot understand. God provides this lesson in his\\ndiscourse on creation in Job 38-40.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe theological confusion of Job and his friends along with God\\'s\\nexamination comprises the book\\'s celebrated poetic content, thirty-nine\\nchapters which focus on Job\\'s plight (Job 3-41). First, the acrimonious\\ndiscussion of Job and his friends. Then arrogant Elihu who falsely claimed\\nGod had given him a message for Job. Finally, God came and restored Job.\\nThis day was also Satan\\'s final chance to so provoke Job that he would\\ncurse God. Yet when the day was over, Job\\'s confidence in God was fully\\nrestored.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nJob\\'s friends knew much of the ways of God, but there was this great gap in\\ntheir theology-believing that all human suffering was the result of\\npersonal sin. Purely cause and effect. When one committed sin, God was\\nobligated to punish. In this case they were convinced Job had committed\\nsome awful sin and they continued that vein until God appeared. Eight times\\nthey stated their position with different arguments and eight times Job\\nanswered. Job had defended his innocence, but in the process began to\\nquestion God and even condemn God. Then a fourth person angrily pounced on\\nJob for his words about his innocence and God\\'s unfairness but basically\\nhis solution for Job\\'s suffering was no different than that of the others.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSuddenly God appeared, challenged Job to listen carefully and proceeded to\\nask precise questions about major areas of creation. Here He says more\\nabout His creation than in Genesis or any other book of the Bible. He also\\nspeaks more personally about it with chapters of profound questions. Some\\nstill cannot be answered by the world of science. Only the Creator Himself\\ncould have such intimate knowledge of the universe and its operation. Job\\nhad thought God didn\\'t care, wasn\\'t paying attention. These questions\\ncaused Job to realize that God actively and continuously sustains all\\ncreation so God was not absent or silent but was actively and daily caring\\nfor Job. Job\\'s heart was thrilled. His Old Friend was back.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nCreation is the most basic argument in proclaiming God\\'s love and concern\\nfor mankind. It sets Him apart from all impostors. When it comes to\\nalternatives, how could one not choose the Creator as opposed to the\\nadversary in any of his many costumes? Resolving this heavenly conflict,\\nrecognizing its hurtful effects on humanity and God\\'s provision of the\\nphysical universe summarizes the message of Job, three subjects of\\nearth-shaking proportions all rolled into one comprehensive whole, but so\\nnovel in part to standard Christian thought that certain details must be\\ncarefully examined.\\n</p>\\n<p align=\"center\">\\n<strong>Miserable Comforters: A Further Attack by Satan</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nJob\\'s three friends arrived to find his situation so appalling that    <sup>12</sup>\"they raised their voices and wept, and they tore their robes\\nand sprinkled dust on their heads toward heaven. <sup>13</sup>And they sat\\nwith him on the ground seven days and seven nights, and no one spoke a word\\nto him, for they saw that his suffering was very great.\" Job 2:12-13.\\nFinally, Job broke the silence as he lamented that the pain was so intense\\nthat its only escape was never having been born in the first place.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe next chapters (chapters 4-31) contain three cycles of speeches. Rather\\nthan provide sympathy, the three friends tried to solve the dilemma of\\nJob\\'s great loss. Obviously it was more than coincidence. First Eliphaz\\nspoke and Job answered. Then Bildad gave his ideas and Job countered.\\nLastly Zophar counseled and Job replied. The first cycle is found in\\nchapters 4-14. Eliphaz had an entire week to consider the possibilities and\\nthen he shared his wisdom. \"As I have seen, those who plow iniquity and sow\\ntrouble reap the same.\" Job 4:8. For two chapters (4-5) Eliphaz developed\\nthe idea that Job had lived a life of iniquity. Now God was punishing him.\\nHere was what Job must do. \"As for me, I would seek God, and to God would I\\ncommit my cause.\" Job 5:8. Job gave a lengthy reply in chapters six and\\nseven to the effect that such advice was not helpful, even cynical because\\n\"I have not denied the words of the Holy One.\" Job 6:10. Still, he implored\\nhis friends to provide an answer. \"Teach me, and I will be silent; make me\\nunderstand how I have gone astray.\" Job 6:24.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBildad weighed in with \"Can reeds flourish where there is no water?    <sup>13</sup>Such are the paths of all who forget God; the hope of the\\ngodless shall perish.\" Job 8:11, 13. He affirmed Eliphaz\\'s solution with\\n\"Behold, God will not reject a blameless man, nor take the hand of\\nevildoers.\" Job 8:20. Job replied at length in chapters nine and ten, first\\nagreeing with Bildad, \"Truly I know that it is so,\" then wondering how\\nanyone could be blameless and finally coming up with the opposite answer.    <sup>21</sup>\"I am blameless; <sup>22</sup>therefore I say, He destroys\\nboth the blameless and the wicked.\" Job 9:2, 9:21- 22.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThat really got Zophar\\'s goat. It was his turn and he was livid. He viewed\\nJob as stubborn and harangued him unmercifully with statements like \"Should\\na man full of talk be judged right?\" and grouped Job with \"worthless men.\"\\nHis next insult rated five stars. \"But a stupid man will get understanding\\nwhen a wild donkey\\'s colt is born a man\" (Job 11:2, 11, 12). Donkeys never\\ngive birth to people so Zophar views Job\\'s thinking as hopelessly stupid.\\nHis solution was the same as the others, \"If iniquity is in your hand, put\\nit far away\" (Job 11:14). So far it is hard to detect sympathy or comfort.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nZophar rang Job\\'s bell. Following his friends\\' first three speeches, Job\\nbegan a three-chapter rebuttal with this epic retort, \"No doubt you are the\\npeople and wisdom will die with you.\" Job 12:2. Stedman paraphrases Job\\'s\\nput down like this: \"You\\'ve got all the answers, you\\'ve solved all the\\nproblems, you know everything.\"    <a href=\"#_ftn3\" name=\"_ftnref3\" title=\"\"><sup><sup>[3]</sup></sup></a> The\\nmore they pushed, the more Job pushed back. In the process he said worse\\nand worse things about God. He insisted repeatedly that God was treating\\nhim unjustly. \"I want to argue my ways to His face,\" \"Why do you [God]\\ncount me as your enemy?\" \"You put my feet in the stocks.\" \"You destroy the\\nhope of man.\" Job 13:15, 24, 27; 14:19.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe second round of speeches (chapters 15-21) grew in unkindness and\\nhardened positions. The third round (chapters 22-31) included baseless\\ncharges of specific sins (Job 22:6-9). Eliphaz and Bildad said hateful\\nthings while Zophar gave up. Meanwhile Job had more and more to say in his\\ndefense. The two sides couldn\\'t be further apart. Their friendship appeared\\nbroken beyond repair.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Insights into Job\\'s Responses</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAs his friends pushed him to the wall, pressing their assault, Job said\\nmore alarming things about God, words for which he would later repent. \"He\\nhas torn me in his wrath and hated me\" (Job 16:9). \"My spirit is broken\"\\n(Job 17:1). \"He has made me a byword of the peoples\" (Job 17:6). \"God has\\nput me in the wrong\" (Job 19:6). \"He has kindled his wrath against me and\\ncounts me as his adversary.\" Job 16:9; 17:1, 6; 19:6, 11. Speaking directly\\nto God, Job said, \"You have turned cruel to me; with the might of your\\nhand, you persecute me.\" Job 30:21. Finally, Job defiantly demanded an\\naffidavit of charges from God and stated that he would stand before God as\\na prince and defend himself (Job 31:35-37).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nOn the other hand, his words revealed a remarkable life of faith. \"I have\\nnot denied the words of the Holy One.\" \"I who called to God and he answered\\nme, a just and blameless man, am a laughing stock.\" \"Though he slay me, I\\nwill hope in him\" (Job 13:15). \"For I know that my Redeemer lives&#8230;in\\nmy flesh I shall see God.\" \"My foot has held fast to his steps, I have kept\\nhis way&#8230;I have not departed from the commandments of his lips; I have\\ntreasured the words of his mouth more than my portion of food.\"    <sup>2</sup>\"Oh, that I were as in the months of old, as in the days when\\nGod watched over me, <sup>3</sup>when his lamp shone upon my head, and by\\nhis light I walked through the darkness, <sup>4</sup>as I was in my prime,\\nwhen the friendship of God was upon my tent, <sup>5</sup>when the Almighty\\nwas yet with me.\" Job 6:10; 12:4; 13:15; 19:25-26; 23:11-12; 29:2-5.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nHere, approximately midway between creation and Christ, God\\'s words were\\navailable, His commandments known, man recognized His light. Further, man\\ncalled on God and God answered him. Therefore, man knew God watched over\\nhim, had hope in a living redeemer, walked with God, sensed God\\'s\\nfriendship and lived in the expectancy of ultimately seeing God in his\\nflesh. These words testify to a just God who in every age provides\\nknowledge of Himself to those who seek that knowledge. Job spoke of himself\\nas \"just and blameless.\" He had lived up to all the light God had given.\\nGod had revealed that He would bless those who so lived. For this reason,\\nJob was so confused, so bewildered, so brokenhearted.\\n</p>\\n<p align=\"center\">\\n<strong>Elihu: Satan\\'s Final Attack</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAfter Job\\'s friends spoke, an angry individual named Elihu demanded a\\nhearing. This individual was not a peer of the four. Being young he had no\\nchoice but to wait until the others had finished. Then he unloaded for six\\nchapters (Job 32-37) saying more than the entire books of I-III John. He\\ntook an entire chapter just to dogmatically state that he had the answer\\n(chapter 32). He speaks even more vilely of Job than the three. If Satan\\nwere using them to destroy Job, how much more this man? Fortunately, Job\\ndid not reply. Either he was too exhausted or more likely, God broke in\\nbefore Job could say something even more regrettable.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nElihu\\'s demeanor was so disgustingly arrogant one might be tempted to\\nassociate him with Nimrod, but no one can prove this link for sure. Elihu\\nwas a Buzite of the family of Ram. Ham\\'s oldest son Cush had a son named\\nRaamah (Ram). Raamah fathered Sheba and Dedan. Since these people groups\\nare mentioned in the discourses of Job, they could have had a son named Buz\\nfrom whom Elihu came. The most notorious of Cush\\'s sons was evil Nimrod\\n(Genesis 10:6-8). While Elihu\\'s actions point to such an association, we\\nhave previously observed that the same names occur again and again in the\\nOld Testament so one must be very cautious about identifying a certain\\nindividual or place with one previously mentioned.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nDeviously Elihu said that Job was wrong about God not speaking (Job\\n33:14ff). He claimed that God spoke in dreams but man (Job) didn\\'t listen.\\nGod also spoke through pain. Further, God sent mediators or angels (Elihu\\nis referring to himself) \"to declare to man [the sinner] what is right for\\nhim.\" Job 33:23. This angel (the one with an answer from God) says to the\\nsinner, \"I have found a ransom.\" Job 33:24. The ransom is what the sinner\\nmust do to be restored. In this way Elihu was claiming to have a direct\\nmessage from God which was false.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThen Elihu proceeded to describe how the sinner (Job) should embrace the\\nransom (ie, Elihu\\'s solution) by abandoning his great wickedness which\\nElihu spells out in the next chapters.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    <sup>26</sup>\\n    Then man prays to God, and he [God] accepts him; he [the repentant\\n    sinner] sees his face [sees God\\'s face] with a shout of joy, and he\\n    [God] restores to man [to the sinner] his righteousness. <sup>27</sup>\\n    He [the sinner] sings before men and says: \"I sinned and perverted what\\n    was right, and it was not repaid to me. <sup>28</sup>He [God] has\\n    redeemed my soul from going down to the pit, and my life shall look\\n    upon the light.\" Job 33:26-28.\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIn chapter 34 Elihu continued at length on how God sees all man\\'s steps,\\nparticularly Job\\'s, so \"there is no gloom or deep darkness where evildoers\\nmay hide themselves.\" Job 34:21-22. God calls them \"worthless,\" \"wicked,\"\\nand He \"shows no partiality,\" \"shatters the mighty without investigation,\"\\n\"overturns them in the night and they are crushed,\" \"strikes them for their\\nwickedness&#8230; because they turned aside from following him.\" \"They\\ncaused the cry of the poor to come to Him.\" Job 34:18-19, 23-25, 27-28. He\\nwishes that Job were \"tried to the end, because he answers like wicked men,    <sup>37</sup>for he adds rebellion to his sin.\" Job 34:36-37. To Elihu Job\\nhas acted so wickedly that God should punish him even more severely.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIn view of his litany of Job\\'s sins and Job\\'s terrible suffering because of\\nthem, it is hard to deny that Elihu actually held the same position as the\\nfirst three, that Job\\'s sins had resulted in God\\'s judgment. Yet Scripture\\nalready told us that Job\\'s loss of possessions and health was not over\\nsinfulness but due to an unseen contest in heaven. God said specifically\\nbefore the entire heavenly host \"that there is none like him on the earth,\\na blameless and upright man, who fears God and turns away from evil.\" Job\\n1:8.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSo, contrary to the views of most commentators, Elihu did not have a\\nmessage from God or even the answer to Job\\'s suffering and he was not sent\\nto prepare Job for God\\'s visit. While they correctly observe that God did\\nnot condemn him or require an offering from him or even mention him, we\\nsuggest he was so blatantly out of order that Scripture leaves the reader\\nto correctly assess his discourse. He was clearly Satan\\'s last attempt to\\nget Job to curse God. Being young in the faith God let him off with a large\\nmeasure of grace, sparing him further public humiliation.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nOn the other hand, Job\\'s friends were Job\\'s age and knew much sound\\ndoctrine. Certainly they should have known better than to charge Job with\\nspecific sins, apparently parroting the idle gossip that spread rumors of\\nsins supposedly committed by Job. Elihu would see how God dealt with them.\\nHopefully someday he would match his zeal for God with spiritual wisdom. In\\nthe end God would say to Eliphaz, \"My anger burns against you and against\\nyour two friends, for you have not spoken of me what is right, as my\\nservant Job has.\" Job 42:7. In fact, all four taught God was behind human\\nsuffering. This was an attack on the very character of God.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nJob had stated over and over that he wanted an audience with God. Elihu\\'s\\nlast words were \"He does not regard any who are wise in their own conceit.\"\\nJob 37:24. The very next words are \"Then the LORD answered Job out of the\\nwhirlwind and said&#8230;\" Job 38:1. Contrary to Elihu\\'s pronouncement, God\\ndid come to Job, providing further evidence of just how empty Elihu\\'s words\\nwere.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWith the assault of Elihu the contest was over. Job had not cursed God. God\\nwas vindicated before the angels. Now Job must be restored. As only God\\ncould, He reestablished Job\\'s fellowship and trust in Him and even reunited\\nhim with his friends. How God does this is the subject of chapters 38-42.\\n</p>\\n<p align=\"center\">\\n<strong>God\\'s Creation Discourse</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nGod accomplishes multiple purposes in his discourse to Job. First, Job had\\nsaid awful things about God and needed to repent. Second, God\\'s anger\\nburned against his three friends. They needed to cover their sin with\\nsacrifice. Third, Job and his friends needed to be reconciled. Fourth, Job\\nneeded to learn the true source of his suffering. In fact, all mankind\\nneeded to know that Satan seeks to destroy us and, in the process, produces\\nuntold suffering. Possibly theological thinking attributed all suffering to\\nGod from creation up to Job\\'s day. This idea was a huge distortion of the\\ngoodness of God and needed to be corrected. In a way, all these individual\\npurposes come together to broaden our understanding of God\\'s nature. He is\\nperfect love and perfect righteousness. Job is given to help man see more\\nof God\\'s glory.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nJob felt God did not care about his intense and extended suffering. Job was\\nwrong. God did care. If Job\\'s condition had been fatal, upon death he would\\nhave been welcomed into paradise with superlatives for his notable faith.\\nBut since God had other plans for Job, He chose to restore his wavering\\nfaith by appearing to him personally and speaking to him more about His\\ncreation than to any other person on record in all of human history. This\\nwas a signal honor. Nevertheless, Job needed to retract statements he had\\nmade about God under duress, so God\\'s instruction took on a very personal\\nform, numerous direct questions about creation that would cause any\\nthinking person to realize His careful design of and providential care for\\nthe earth and its inhabitants.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThis was overwhelming evidence that God knew the smallest details about His\\ncreation and therefore, about Job\\'s life as well as ours. God was working.\\nHe was involved. How could Job say God didn\\'t care when His creation shows\\nHe does care. Creation is a huge testimony to God\\'s watching over every\\nman. Jesus said God sees a single sparrow that falls to the ground and a\\nperson is of far greater value than sparrows. In fact, God numbers every\\nhair on a person\\'s head (Matt 10:29-31).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nPossibly no one has spoken more clearly on the significance of God\\'s\\nappearance to Job and its meaning than Henry Morris:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    People say that the Book of Job was written to solve this problem\\n    [human suffering], so what does God have to say about it? Amazingly,\\n    God says nothing about it! His divine message, given out of the\\n    whirlwind, occupies 123 verses in four chapters, yet there is not a\\n    word about the sufferings of Job, or even about human suffering in\\n    general. What God does talk about is creation! The mighty message from\\n    heaven focuses exclusively on the doctrine of special creation of all\\n    things by God, and then his providential care of his creation. It\\n    exalts his power, his wisdom, his purpose, his love.\\n    <a href=\"#_ftn4\" name=\"_ftnref4\" title=\"\">\\n        <sup><strong><sup>[4]</sup></strong></sup>\\n    </a>\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nGod first addressed Job with, \"Who is this that darkens counsel by words\\nwithout knowledge?\" Job 38:2. Job repeated this very statement when he\\nrepented indicating they were addressed to him, not Elihu as some\\ncommentators suggest. God then commands Job to \"Dress for action like a\\nman; I will question you and you make it known to me.\" Job 38:3. It had\\nbeen a grueling, exhausting day. How could Job have come to attention and\\nfocused mentally for another hour? Only with God\\'s help. Surely God\\nstrengthened His beloved servant to receive His corrective message. God\\nwould direct the conversation. He would ask the questions. Job was required\\nto answer.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nFirst question about creation: \"Where were you when I laid the foundation\\nof the earth? Tell me, if you have understanding.\" Job 38:4. For starters,\\nGod was asking, \"How much greater is the Almighty than man?\" The missing\\nanswer is \"the Almighty was building a universe when man did not even\\nexist.\" This measure shows just how insignificant man is in comparison with\\nthe Almighty who set in place the scientific principles that make the\\nuniverse work. Job must have thought, \"Oh, Oh! If there are more questions\\nlike this, I won\\'t be doing much answering.\"\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nLater in His four-chapter discourse God reproved him with \"Shall a\\nfaultfinder contend with the Almighty? He who argues with God, let him\\nanswer it.\" Job 40:2. God was pointing out that Job had spoken sinfully of\\nthe Creator and he needed to confess his wrong. In the end Job did just\\nthat.\\n</p>\\n<p align=\"center\">\\n<strong>Effect of God\\'s Questions</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWith the thirty-fourth verse discourse about Leviathan God was done. For\\nfour chapters He had spoken of creating and preserving the universe, the\\nearth and all living things on it. He spoke with authority and certainty;\\nyet, underneath was an unspoken message of concern and even pleading with\\nJob. \"How could you say such things of Me when I have done and continue to\\ndo all this for you?\" These words that seem so stern at first really\\ncontained a deep drawing of Job\\'s heart back to God. Job simply melted; his\\nheartache vanished; he replaced silence with words of repentance:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    <sup>2</sup>\\n    I know that you can do all things, and that no purpose of yours can be\\n    thwarted. <sup>3\"</sup>Who is this that hides counsel without\\n    knowledge?\" [Job repeats God\\'s initial question.] Therefore I have\\n    uttered what I did not understand, things too wonderful for me, which I\\n    did not know. <sup>4</sup>Hear, and I will speak; \"I will question you,\\n    and you make it known to me.\" [Job recites God\\'s initial command that\\n    he now answers.] <sup>5</sup>I had heard of you by the hearing of the\\n    ear, but now my eye sees you; <sup>6</sup>therefore I despise myself,\\n    and repent in dust and ashes. Job 42:2-6.\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWith this confession of sin Job was again right with God. Now he was needed\\nto perform a spiritual service, a priestly function. His friends had\\nstirred God to anger by their false representation of Him. They too must be\\nbrought back to God and Job is asked to be the human agent in this\\nrestoration. God said to Eliphaz the Temanite:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    <sup>7</sup>\\n    My anger burns against you and against your two friends, for you have\\n    not spoken of me what is right, as my servant Job has. <sup>8</sup>Now\\n    therefore take seven bulls and seven rams and go to my servant Job and\\n    offer up a burnt offering for yourselves. And my servant Job shall pray\\n    for you, for I will accept his prayer not to deal with you according to\\n    your folly. For you have not spoken of me what is right, as my servant\\n    Job has. Job 42:7-8.\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nNow it was their turn to repent. Verse nine records that they did. They\\noffered the sacrifices God required. No common person could afford to\\nsacrifice a bull. The sacrifice of seven bulls and seven rams showed in a\\nmaterial way how they had been Job\\'s peers, men of wealth. Job witnessed\\ntheir act of repentance.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBut how could Job pray for them after all the ugly words between him and\\nhis friends. They had said hateful things of him and he had replied with\\nincreasing rancor: \"No doubt you are the people and wisdom will die with\\nyou.\" \"You whitewash with lies; worthless physicians are you all.\"\\n\"Miserable comforters are you all.\" \"Ten times you cast reproach upon me;\\nare you not ashamed to wrong me?\" \"How then will you comfort me with your\\nempty nothings? There is nothing left of your answers but falsehood\" \"How\\nyou have helped him who has no power! How you have counseled him who has no\\nwisdom&#8230;With whose help have you uttered words?\" Job 12:2; 13:4; 16:2;\\n19:3; 21:34; 26:1-3. After such sharp words in their all-day exchange, how\\ncould they ever want to speak to each other? How could they ever want Job\\'s\\nprayers and how could Job find it in his heart to pray for them? Yet it all\\nhappened as God directed:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the\\n    Naamathite went and did what the LORD had told them, and the LORD\\n    accepted Job\\'s prayer. Job 42:9.\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAt the age of 140 Job prayed for them, forgiving every unkind thing they\\nhad said. He illustrates the truth that it is never too late to forgive the\\nwrongs others have done to us. Job\\'s confidence in God was restored as he\\nsaw God in an entirely new light. For his final 140 years he would share\\nthese radically new insights about the LORD\\'s work in creation and His\\nprovidential care for it. In the end his book would become one of the most\\nproclaimed pieces of literature in all human history.\\n</p>\\n<br clear=\"all\"/>\\n<div>\\n<br clear=\"all\"/>\\n<hr width=\"33%\" size=\"1\" align=\"left\"/>\\n<div id=\"ftn1\">\\n    <p>\\n        <a href=\"#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\" title=\"\">\\n            <sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup>\\n        </a>\\n        Keil, <em>Genesis, Volume I</em>, 60.\\n    </p>\\n</div>\\n<div id=\"ftn2\">\\n    <p>\\n        <a href=\"#_ftnref2\" name=\"_ftn2\" title=\"\">\\n            <sup><sup>[2]</sup></sup>\\n        </a>\\n        Henry M.

The next chapter found that the very purpose of Job,\\nidentifying the supreme enemy of man\\'s soul, argues convincingly for\\nmissing generations. Now a third argument from the book of Job, equally\\npowerful, fills chapter 11-- constant references to unusual weather\\nconditions. Such weather uniquely characterizes an ice age. The events of\\nJob are played against the backdrop of the Great Ice Age and reflect a\\nsetting long before Solomon or even Abraham.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nHenry Morris observed that Job mentioned cold more than any other book in\\nthe Bible. He went out on a limb to write \"there are even hints of the\\npost-flood Ice Age scattered throughout the Book of Job.\"    <a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\" title=\"\"><sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup></a> The\\nstruggle for survival in an ice age world filled the memories of all who\\nspoke in Job. Job himself personally experienced at least the tail end of\\nthe Great Ice Age in the first 140 years of his life. This provides the\\nstrongest of the three arguments found in chapters 9-11 for generations\\nbeing omitted between Eber and Peleg since the Patriarchs lived long after\\nthe Ice Age. But as previously discussed expositors place Job\\'s years\\nanywhere from the days of the Patriarchs to the days of David (2100-1000\\nBC).\\n</p>\\n<p align=\"center\">\\n<strong>\\n    Discovering Dr. Bernard E. Northrup\\n    <a href=\"#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\" title=\"\">\\n        <sup><strong><sup>[2]</sup></strong></sup>\\n    </a>\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAfter many years of growing conviction that generations are omitted from\\nShem\\'s list, I stumbled across Dr. Bernard E. Northrup who excitedly taught\\nthat the Book of Job graphically portrayed life in the Great Ice Age. He\\nhad been doing this since 1971 but creationists mostly ignored him because\\nof the two catastrophes he saw striking planet earth in Genesis 1:2-8.\\nNevertheless, Northrup was unique in that he was a professional in four\\nareas-geology, the Old Testament, Hebrew and linguistics. Most importantly,\\nhe held to the inerrancy of the Bible. As to geology he loved rocks from\\nchildhood and prepared for a career as a geologist. Then came the call of\\nGod and he became a Hebrew professor instead, teaching seminary level\\nHebrew, Greek and Aramaic for a lifetime. His unique background led to\\nunparalleled insight into the subject of <em>HB</em>.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nOver the years he served his denomination\\'s mission board by helping Bible\\ntranslators often located in remote areas typically accessed by missionary\\naircraft. Geology was always in the back of his mind because to him it\\nconfirmed the Bible and showed beyond question the reality of the God he\\nloved. Whenever possible he would work with the pilot to plot a course that\\ntook him by a significant geological formation. For nearly half a century\\nhe collected information on hundreds of formations his gifted eyes\\nobserved, invariably associating them the great biblical event that\\nproduced them. In the church this author attended was a retired missionary\\nwho told of arranging for Northrup to see a formation in northeastern\\nBrazil.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nNorthrup correctly felt that God\\'s Word and God\\'s works would agree. By\\nthat he meant the Bible and the geological column would agree. He felt that\\nGod\\'s creating an earth covered with water on Day One of creation week and\\nthrusting up the super continent out of the water to begin Day Three would\\nhave produced a considerable portion of the geologic column. This is the\\nportion that lacks fossils. Then the Flood contributed its share to the\\ngeological column and the breakup of the super continent added further\\nfeatures, according to Northrup. Last of all and maybe on the back of the\\nsuper continent break up, the Great Ice Age would have completed the\\ngeological column.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIn Northrup\\'s early years (1950-1975) he adamantly opposed those who\\nassigned most or even the entire geologic column to Noah\\'s Flood. In one\\narticle he welcomed the ideas of a promising young geologist, Dr. Steven A.\\nAustin, feeling those ideas were headed in the right direction. Austin\\'s\\ndoctoral dissertation spoke of coal fields in New York and Pennsylvania\\ngrading from harder coal in the east to softer coal in the west. In\\nNorthrup\\'s opinion the action of the biblical Flood explained how this\\nhappened.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    Job: Replete with Ice Age Phenomena\\n    <a href=\"#_ftn3\" name=\"_ftnref3\" title=\"\">\\n        <sup><strong><sup>[3]</sup></strong></sup>\\n    </a>\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nNorthrup\\'s views reached maturity about the middle of his career when it\\ncame to him that Job was an ice age book. No previous Old Testament scholar\\nhad drawn such a conclusion. Why could he? The explanation lies in the fact\\nthat the science behind an ice age was brand new. It began to develop\\nduring his lifetime and continues to grow to this day. His training and\\ncontinuing interest in geology plus his highly developed skills in biblical\\nHebrew made him the man of the hour. To this day some 50 years after his\\n1971 epiphany few expositors acknowledge the many ice age statements in the\\nbook. To help the reader see this aspect of the book of Job, Northrup\\'s ice\\nage observations are drawn into the list below:\\n</p>\\n<ol type=\"1\" start=\"1\">\\n<li>\\n    Seas frozen over (\"the broad waters are frozen fast\" 37:10; \"the waters\\n    become hard like stone, and the face of the deep is frozen\" 38:30);\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n    Clouds loaded with moisture (\"He loads the thick cloud with moisture\"\\n    37:11);\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n    Ice swollen flash floods (\"My brothers are treacherous...as torrential\\n    streams...dark with ice\" 6:15-16);\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n    Volcanism/pyroclastic flows (\"fire of God fell from heaven\" 1:16;\\n    \"underneath it is turned up as by fire\" 28:5);\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n    Sun and stars hidden by the thick clouds of hypercyclones and possibly\\n    dense clouds of ash from volcanic eruptions (\"who commands the sun, and\\n    it does not rise\" 9:7; \"Deep darkness...thick clouds\" 22:13-14);\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n    Glaciers (\"From whose womb did the ice come forth?\" 38:29);\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n    Canyon-cutting erosion (\"who has cleft a channel for the torrents of\\n    rain?\" 38:25);\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n    Extreme earthquakes ([he] \"shakes the earth out of its place, and its\\n    pillars tremble\" 9:6);\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n    Crustal upheaval (\"he removes...overturns the mountains\" 9:5);\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n    Destructive winds (\"a great wind struck the four corners of the house,\\n    and it fell upon the young people, and they are dead\" 1:19);\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n    Violent lightning storms (\"He lets go...His lightning to the corners of\\n    the earth\" 37:3);\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n    Intense rainfall (\"His mighty downpour [forces] every man [indoors]\"\\n    37:6-7);\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n    Snow and hail storms great enough to interrupt wars (\"Have you entered\\n    the storehouses of the snow or...hail?\" 38:22-23);\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n    Hunger and inadequate shelter (\"want and hard hunger...dwell in\\n    holes...and rocks\" 30:3, 6);\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n    Tsunamis (\"If he withholds the waters, they dry up; if he sends them\\n    out, they overwhelm the land\" 12:15).\\n</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Significance of the Above List</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThrough the centuries no one associated these acts of nature with an ice\\nage because the science behind it was not understood. Even today the cause\\nof the many ice ages embraced by secular science is hotly debated. An ice\\nage requires two opposite conditions-heat and cold. The heat is necessary\\nto evaporate vast quantities of water from the ocean which falls as record\\namounts of rainfall at lower latitudes and sleet and snow at upper\\nlatitudes. The friction of earth movements produced by powerful\\nearthquakes, by the horizontal and vertical movement of crustal plates and\\nby extensive volcanic activity combine to generate the heat. All of these\\nacts of nature are found in Job.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAtmospheric volcanic ash accounts for the cold. One Indonesian volcano,\\nMount Tambora, erupted throughout 1815 and 1816. Its ash blanketed the\\nearth sufficiently to cause worldwide harvest failures in 1816, an event\\nknown as the year without a summer. Behind this phenomenon is the physics\\nof wave lengths. A thin layer of ash high in the sky does not impede light\\nrays. Even in the presence of such a layer the sun by day and the moon and\\nstars by night can be seen. But heat has a different wave length. This\\ndifference decreases its ability to pass through even a thin layer of ash.\\nDepending on the amount of ash in the sky, a portion of the sun\\'s heat rays\\nare reflected back into space.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nTo bring on an ice age volcanoes need to release enough volcanic ash to\\ndrop summer temperatures by up to 40 degrees. Further, this condition must\\nlast for centuries. The multiplication of and eventual extinction of Wooley\\nMammoths along the Arctic shoreline reveals this happened. Only Noah\\'s\\nflood could cause these two extreme conditions. Since there was only one\\nsuch flood that covered the highest mountains, there was only one ice age.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nCreation scientists have advanced various models for the Biblical Flood.\\nOne, the Catastrophic Tectonic Plate theory, produces ample earth movements\\nto produce the necessary heat. First, the entire pre-Flood ocean floor\\nsubducted under the great continent. Second, a 45,000-mile trench formed on\\nthe ocean floor, allowing magma to rise from deep in the earth and replace\\nthe old ocean floor. Third, heat from the magma and the friction of rock\\nsliding on rock warmed the world\\'s oceans by 40 to 50 degrees. Fourth, vast\\nworldwide volcanic activity continued for the next thousand years. Fifth,\\nthe heated oceans evaporated enormous quantities of water to produce the\\nIce Age. Sixth, the one great continent broke up into the many continents\\nand islands of today.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nRegardless of the model, continuous ash in the sky and massive evaporation\\nfrom the world\\'s oceans caused the Ice Age. By Job\\'s day the earth was\\nsettling down and the Ice Age was coming to an end, but the extreme\\nconditions it produced were still vividly in the collective memory of all\\nwho spoke and are found frequently in their dialog.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nJob hardly begins when these extremes appear. In his back yard, so to\\nspeak, a volcanic pyroclastic flow consumed his 7000 sheep and their\\nkeepers (Job 1:16). His servant described the event as \"the fire of God.\"\\nWhile it may have been a lightning storm ranging over many square miles of\\nland which would be remarkable in itself, other acts of nature in the book\\npoint to a volcano spewing hot gasses down its side and across Job\\'s\\ngrazing land. Volcanoes are the result of earth movements and unheard-of\\nearth movements were still common in Job\\'s day. Both earth movements far\\nbeyond anything experienced today and the earthquakes of enormous magnitude\\nthat they produced are casually mentioned:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    <sup>5</sup>\\n    He who removes mountains, and they know it not, when he overturns them\\n    in his anger, <sup>6</sup>who shakes the earth out of its place, and\\n    its pillars tremble. Job 9:5-6.\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nJust three verses after the fire of God, a violent storm with unheard of\\nwind speeds struck. This mega-tornado collapsed his oldest son\\'s house,\\nfell on its occupants and killed hundreds. He lived in a house, not in the\\ntent of a nomad. For the sake of coolness houses in hot, dry lands were\\nconstructed with heavy building materials like stone or brick. Lost were\\nJob\\'s seven sons, three daughters, family members, guests, friends, and all\\nthe servants but one.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIn Job are more references to ice age type weather than any other book of\\nthe Bible. During the Great Ice Age, while snow fell at the upper\\nlatitudes, rain fell closer to the equator on land that later became\\ndeserts. Both statements in the book of Job and modern science reveal this.\\nThe following pages cite numerous indications of such weather conditions:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    <sup>15</sup>\\n    My brothers are treacherous as a torrent-bed, as torrential streams\\n    that pass away, <sup>16</sup>which are dark with ice, and where the\\n    snow hides itself. <sup>17</sup>When they melt, they disappear, when it\\n    is hot, they vanish from their place. Job 6:15-17\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThese verses depict weather extremes-large quantities of ice and snow\\naccumulating in stream beds during the winter period, then becoming\\ntreacherous as the summer hot weather melted them in areas that today are\\nsemi-deserts.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThose of Job\\'s day observed how such rushing water produced erosion which\\nhe used to illustrate how his suffering was wearing away his faith:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    The waters wear away the stones, the torrents wash away the soil of the\\n    earth; [even] so you destroy the hope of man. Job 19:14.\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nLike ice and cold, excessive water is mentioned frequently in Job. Eliphaz\\neulogizes God\\'s provision of water: \"he gives rain on the earth and sends\\nwaters on the fields.\" Job 5:10. Job spoke of washing himself with snow\\n(Job 9:30) and of waiting for the spring rain (Job 29:23). \"They [the poor]\\nare wet with the rain of the mountains.\" \"Drought and heat snatch away the\\nsnow waters.\" \"In the gullies of the torrents they [the poor] must dwell.\"\\n\"The wind...the roar of the storm\" (Job 24:8, 19; 30:6, 22). Job, Elihu and\\neven God Himself dwelt on violent storms, snow, ice, thick clouds and the\\nrain they produced, none of which are common events in NW Arabia today or\\neven when Abraham lived.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    <sup>8</sup>\\n    He binds up the waters in his thick clouds, and the cloud is not split\\n    open under them. <sup>14</sup>The thunder of his power, who can\\n    understand? (Selected statements of Job in 6:8-14.)\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    <sup>6</sup>\\n    For to the snow he [God] says, \\'Fall on the earth,\\' likewise to the\\n    downpour, his mighty downpour. <sup>10</sup>By the breath of God ice is\\n    given, and the broad waters are frozen fast. <sup>11</sup>He loads the\\n    thick cloud with moisture; the clouds scatter his lightning. (Selected\\n    statements of Elihu in Job 37:6-11.)\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    <sup>22</sup>\\n    Have you entered the storehouses of the snow, or have you seen the\\n    storehouses of the hail? <sup>25</sup>Who has cleft a channel for the\\n    torrents of rain and a way for the thunderbolt, <sup>26</sup>to bring\\nrain on a land where no man is, on the desert in which there is no man,        <sup>27</sup>to satisfy the waste and desolate land and to make the\\n    ground sprout with grass? <sup>28</sup>Has the rain a father or who has\\n    begotten the drops of dew? <sup>29</sup>From whose womb did the ice\\ncome forth, and who has given birth to the frost of heaven?        <sup>30</sup>The waters become hard like stone, and the face of the\\n    deep is frozen. <sup>34</sup>Can you lift up your voice to the clouds,\\n    that a flood of waters may cover you? <sup>35</sup>Can you send forth\\n    lightnings&#8230;. <sup>37</sup>Who can number the clouds by wisdom? Or\\n    who can tilt the waterskins of the heavens, <sup>38</sup>when the dust\\n    runs into a mass and the clods stick fast together? (Selected\\n    statements of God in Job 38.)\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nElihu spoke of lakes frozen fast (Job 37:10) while God spoke of seas being\\nfrozen: \"waters become hard like stone and the face of the deep is frozen.\"\\nJob 38:30. These words describe ice age events. Deserts are notorious for\\nheat and cold. But cold nights don\\'t freeze lakes like stone or cover seas\\nwith ice. Job may have learned of frozen oceans from travelers since\\ncaravan drivers heard many tales. But Elihu was most likely speaking about\\nlakes freezing solid right where these five men lived-in an area from\\ncentral Mesopotamia to central Jordan. Such extensive freezing could only\\noccur before the Ice Age ended.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong> Growing Desertification </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe book of Job speaks at length of large-scale farming and ranching on the\\none hand and desert-like conditions on the other. It would seem that they\\ndon\\'t go together, but the fact remains that a careful examination of many\\nstatements suggests there was a cold, wet season and a hot, dry one and\\nthat both were extreme where Job lived. The wet season brought some\\nviolently moist weather while the dry season was very hot. This would have\\noccurred in the final stages of the Ice Age.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Rifts and Tidal Waves</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nGeologists know of another earth movement that happened late in all this\\nactivity. A crack developed in the crust of the Afro-Eurasian continent,\\nfrom Turkey all the way to Tanzania, 6000 miles to the south. It is called\\nthe Syro-African Rift. Northrup carefully investigated the Jordan Rift\\nsegment where a lake formed from north of the Sea of Galilee to south of\\nthe Dead Sea. Geologists call this ancient body of water Lake Lisan. Ice\\nage storms may have filled Lake Lisan to the point where it connected with\\nthe Red Sea but movements changed that topography again and again so no one\\ncan tell for sure. But if so, the surface of the lake would have been over\\na quarter of a mile higher than the present elevation of the Dead Sea.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nNorthrup graphically captures the reader\\'s imagination by saying that Job\\n12:15 (point #15 above) poetically describes the action of a tsunami/tidal\\nwave. First the water recedes due to an earthquake somewhere at sea, but\\nthen returns with great destructive force. Northrup found plains high above\\nthe Sea of Galilee and the Dead Sea that were washed repeatedly by tsunamis\\nall the way to the mountains in Jordan. He also found walls high on either\\nside of the Jordan Rift that were pounded by wave action. If Job lived at\\nthat time, he could have been an eye witness to these tidal waves and\\nLeviathans that made their way up the trench from the Red Sea. All of this\\naction left a fertile valley. Half a millennium later when most of the\\nwater had evaporated Scripture described the southern portion of this\\nvalley which attracted Lot along with the substantial population of Sodom\\nand Gomorrah:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    And Lot lifted up his eyes and saw that the Jordan Valley was well\\n    watered everywhere like the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt,\\n    in the direction of Zoar. (This was before the LORD destroyed Sodom and\\n    Gomorrah.) Genesis 13:10.\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIf the Great Ice Age is so obvious in the Book of Job, why didn\\'t students\\nof the book point this out long ago? As previously pointed out, first and\\nforemost, the science of an ice age only began to be hammered out during\\nthe 20<sup>th</sup> century and its fine points are still being debated so\\nthe associated phenomena were not realized in the past. Consequently, Bible\\nexpositors through the ages would have been ignorant of the weather\\nphenomena associated with an ice age and interpreted those Hebrew\\nexpressions within the range of their non-ice age knowledge. Second, some\\nof the references identified by Northrup could be explained in other ways!\\nFor example, Job 9:17: \"He crushes me with a tempest\" is figurative. As a\\nsatisfying explanation for the verse, the expositor would leave it at that.\\nBut behind Job\\'s metaphor would be the literal kind of violent storm he\\nexperienced during the Great Ice Age that took people\\'s lives. Third, there\\nwas only one ice age so at only one time in all Bible history would such\\nphenomena actually be witnessed by people and described.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nMaybe even more astonishing is the fact that Northrup had been teaching Job\\nfor nearly 20 years when this insight suddenly came to him. Imagine-a\\nscholar in the Hebrew who was also an avid professional geologist did not\\nsee those clear references to an ice age for that many years. This suggests\\nhow difficult it is for mankind to recognize obvious truths in God\\'s Word\\nwhen their minds have not been conditioned to such insights. Maybe this\\nexplains why twenty centuries of Christian scholarship has not recognized\\nthe obvious omission of names between Eber and Peleg.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Hypercyclones and Rainfall in Job</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe Book of Job speaks often of fierce rain storms. To have such heavy\\nrainfall there must be thick clouds. Eliphaz speaks of clouds so thick that\\nJob might think God could not see what he did: \"But you say, \\'What does God\\nknow? Can he judge through the deep darkness? Thick clouds veil him, so\\nthat he does not see.\" Job 22:13-14. Later Elihu says, \"He loads the clouds\\nwith thick moisture.\" Job 37:10. In fact, Elihu spent all of Job 37\\nspeaking of extreme weather and most of it had to do with rain. He stated\\nthat God orders \"the downpour, his mighty downpour\" to fall and it drives\\nboth man and beast to shelter (Job 37:6-8).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nGod Himself asked Job:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    <sup>25</sup>\\n    Who has cleft a channel for the torrents of rain\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>and a way for the thunderbolt, </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong><sup>26</sup>to bring rain on a land where no man is, </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>on the desert in which there is no man, </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong><sup>27</sup>to satisfy the waste and desolate land </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>and to make the ground sprout with grass? Job 38:25-27.</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nHere God speaks of the erosion caused by intense rainfall. He even says He\\ncauses rain to fall on the desert and that it sprouts with grass. Just how\\nfrequently this would have happened in Job\\'s day is explained by\\nmeteorologist Dr. Larry Vardiman whose specialty is hurricanes. He and an\\nassociate modeled a hypothetical tropical cyclone in the Arabian Sea\\n(Persian Gulf), raising the sea surface temperature to 95<sup>o</sup>F\\nwhich would have happened frequently in the warmer latitudes during the Ice\\nAge.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe model produced what he called a hypercyclone or hypercane. It was 3000\\nmiles in diameter and stretched from the Western Mediterranean through the\\nMiddle East. Lasting 18 days it produced 15 inches of rain on current\\ndesert regions that now may not see rain in a decade. Over Pakistan it\\ndropped 300 inches of rain. Vardiman concluded that due to Ice Age storms\\npermanent vegetation would have covered much of what is now desert in\\nAfrica and the Middle East for 1000 years.    <a href=\"#_ftn4\" name=\"_ftnref4\" title=\"\"><sup><sup>[4]</sup></sup></a>\\nSeparately, space imaging of the Sahara Desert shows depressions that were\\nonce lakes and archaeological exploration has found recent remains of\\naquatic creatures in those desert formations.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Meaning of Peleg\\'s Name</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIn his later writings Northrup adamantly taught that Peleg\\'s name meant\\nmore than \"divided.\" He insisted that it included the agent of the\\ndivision-water; \"Peleg,\" he said, meant \"divided by water.\" He supported\\nhis view from geology and chronology, but the underlying Hebrew was his\\nmajor argument. Here is the gist of it:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nMost ancient Hebrew words are built on roots of three consonants which form\\na verb. Not until the work of the Masoretic scribes between 500 and 800 AD\\nwere the unwritten vowels sounds and breathing marks added to the text.\\nPeleg\\'s name is built on the root verb PLG which broadly is translated \"to\\nsplit, to divide.\" Strong\\'s Concordance lists 17 occurrences of the noun\\nbuilt on this very root found in the Old Testament. Seven times the noun is\\nused as a proper name and is always translated as the name \"Peleg\" in the\\nEnglish. The other ten times the noun refers to a stream, brook, river or\\nchannel and is translated as such. Strong assigned the word number 6378 to\\nthe noun when it is used in a general way for a flowing stream of water\\n(Isaiah 32:2, Job 29:6, Psalm 1:3; 119:136, Proverbs 5:16, Proverbs 21:1,\\nLamentations 3:48, Isaiah 30:25, Psalm 65:9 and Psalm 46:4) and 6379 when\\nit refers to the son of Eber.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nTo cite just one of these ten verses, familiar Psalm 1:3 says \"He (the man\\nwho delights in the law of the LORD) is like a tree planted by streams of\\nwater.\" The noun \"streams\" is the noun form from the root PLG. Since it is\\npossessive plural, the form is PALGE. How did the Hebrews associate a\\nriver, stream or canal with the concept of dividing? Depending on the size\\nof those flows, they more or less divide or separate people on one side\\nfrom people on the other. Here now is a most remarkable use of the noun.\\nThe very form of Peleg\\'s name, the masculine nominative singular form, is\\nfound in Psalm 65:9 which reads \"The river of God is full of water.\"\\n\"River\" in this verse is PELEG, the same form as the personal noun for a\\nson of Eber, PELEG.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAdditionally, the three-consonant root PLG has an even more basic root, the\\nprimary two-consonant PL collection of words. Besides PLG eight other PL\\nverbs are found in the ancient Hebrew. All in some way are associated with\\n\"divide.\" For instance, one, PLT, means \"to escape.\" One might wonder what\\nthat has to do with \"divide.\" If the prisoner escapes, he is divided from\\nhis prison and captors. Another, PLL, means \"to intervene.\" When someone or\\nsomething intervenes the previous condition is split or divided.\\nConsequently, the choice of the three consonant PLG within this group for a\\nname speaks not only of a division but implies a division somehow\\nassociated with water.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nNorthrup compared the Hebrew with other languages. First, he looked at\\nother Semitic languages and then at non-Semitic languages. He wrote, \"In\\nthe related Semitic languages, Arabic and Ethiopic, the root PLG means\\n\\'river.\\' In Arabic the root is modified to PHALAG.\"    <a href=\"#_ftn5\" name=\"_ftnref5\" title=\"\"><sup><sup>[5]</sup></sup></a> In\\nsearching Classical Greek he found no less than 18 different nouns bearing\\nthe same foundation (PLG) and all referred to the sea in some way. He\\nobserved that even in English this letter sequence is found in such words\\nas archi<strong><u>p</u></strong>e<strong><u>l</u></strong>a<strong><u>g</u></strong>o, <strong><u>p</u></strong>e<strong><u>l</u></strong>a<strong><u>g</u></strong>ic depths and<strong><u>p</u></strong>e<strong><u>l</u></strong>i    <strong><u>c</u></strong>an which is from an associated root, PLK, and\\nrefers to the bill of the pelican that divides the water to catch his prey.    <a href=\"#_ftn6\" name=\"_ftnref6\" title=\"\"><sup><sup>[6]</sup></sup></a>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIn his paper on the rock record Northrup gave the following translation of\\nthe verse which tells why Peleg was given his name:    <a href=\"#_ftn7\" name=\"_ftnref7\" title=\"\"><sup><sup>[7]</sup></sup></a>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    And unto Eber were born two sons. The name of the first was Peleg\\n</strong>\\n[\"divided by water\"]<strong>, for in his days the earth was divided </strong>[by water]    <strong>. </strong><strong>(Brackets by Northrup.) Genesis 10:25. </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIn this reference he explained the meaning of Peleg as follows: \"Both the\\nname \\'Peleg\\' and the word \\'divided\\' are built upon the Hebrew root that\\nconsistently is used of water division. This is true both in Hebrew and in\\nClassical Greek. In the latter there are about 18 nouns based on this root\\nand each one has much to do with the ocean.\" Northrup then took certain\\ncreationists to task with, \"Some creationists have made the terrible\\nmistake of jumping to the conclusion that this verse [Genesis 10:25] refers\\nto the division of the languages at Babel, an event that is described when\\nchapter eleven [of Genesis] fills in important details that were only\\nreferred to in chapter ten. The researcher should note that this is a\\ncommon approach in the Hebrew language.\" The confusion comes because\\nScripture speaks of both a division of mankind into languages (Genesis 10:5\\nand 10:32-which employs an entirely different Hebrew verb root, \"to\\nspread\") and a division of the land surfaces of the earth by water (Genesis\\n10:25-the PLG verb root, \"to divide\").\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nTo summarize, Genesis 10:25 contains the three Hebrew consonants (PLG)\\ntwice, first as a proper name and then as a verb. In both cases Northrup\\nplaced brackets after the Hebrew word to show his understanding of its\\nrelationship to water. In the first instance he defined the Hebrew noun\\nused for a person\\'s name as Peleg or \"divided by water\" and in the second\\ninstance he defined the Hebrew verb PALAG as \"divided by water.\" Thus,\\nNorthrup wrote time and again, \"Peleg was named \\'divided by water.\\'\"    <a href=\"#_ftn8\" name=\"_ftnref8\" title=\"\"><sup><sup>[8]</sup></sup></a> In\\nanother paper he wrote, \"This [\"divided by water\"] is the major meaning of\\nthe word Peleg, surprisingly borne out in cognate and non-cognate\\nlanguages.\"    <a href=\"#_ftn9\" name=\"_ftnref9\" title=\"\"><sup><sup>[9]</sup></sup></a>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nMore recently Dr. John Morris and Dr. James Johnson wrote a paper in which\\nthey agreed with Northrup to a point. Like Northrup they felt the division\\nof Genesis 10:25 was geological and geographical, not linguistic. They\\nspoke of Northrup\\'s work at length. While Northrup felt this division by\\nwater occurred when the great single continent was broken up, they felt it\\nwas accomplished when the ice from the Great Ice Age melted and separated\\nthe continents by water.    <a href=\"#_ftn10\" name=\"_ftnref10\" title=\"\"><sup><sup>[10]</sup></sup></a>\\nOther creationists have also tagged Peleg\\'s name as marking the end of the\\nIce Age when the melting ice sheets raised sea level 400 feet and covered\\nthe land bridges which had connected continents thus dividing the earth by\\nwater. That explanation seems a better fit for the meaning of Peleg\\'s name\\n(\"to divide by water\") and the time in which he lived-39-59 generations\\nafter the Flood.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nNorthrup\\'s explanation required more years between the Flood and Job\\'s\\nordeal than the Masoretic Text allowed. So he turned to the Septuagint\\nchronology. In the LXX he calculated that 531 years elapse from the Flood\\nto the birth of Peleg which together with the additional time in Egypt less\\nUssher\\'s early date for Solomon\\'s temple supplied 645 years of breathing\\nroom. That would be an ice age in record time but it would have to do. The\\nUssher followers cram the Great Ice Age into even fewer years which\\npossibly compromises their science in order to preserve their\\ninterpretation of Shem\\'s genealogy as complete. It would seem that the\\nMasoretic Text numbers together with the hidden beauty of Hebrew\\ngenealogies give a better explanation for the missing years, especially\\nsince there are far more than 645 years.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nNorthrup served on the faculties of Bible colleges and seminaries from 1953\\nto 2005 and addressed these issues for nearly 50 years. He died in 2008.\\nDuring his years he made important contributions to the thinking of those\\nwho have attempted to harmonize what God said in His Word with what He did\\nto the surface of the earth. Northrup declared these ideas in lecture after\\nlecture and wrote them in articles but not in any permanent book. A\\ndecreasing number of web sites contain these articles. Since he expressed\\nideas that are contrary to current thinking, even his sound ideas may\\neventually be lost to the body of Christ. Nevertheless, Northrup would be\\npleased to know that most creationists have come to recognize both\\ncenturies of major geologic activity after the Flood and much geologic\\nactivity before the Flood as well.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nNow you can see why I was so delighted to discover Dr. Bernard E. Northrup.\\nWhile I was certain that Job lived long before the Patriarchs, Northrup\\nwith his ice age observations in Job provided a powerful argument for Job\\nliving long before them. His observations on geology and the Ice Age\\nrequire the many generations that are omitted between Eber and Peleg.\\n</p>\\n<p align=\"center\">\\n<strong>Restatement of the Ice Age Argument</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nOur case that Job lived during the Great Ice Age remains so novel to many\\nit bears a second look. While Job, his friends and even God made numerous\\nreferences to an ice age, no commentator in the past knew what they meant.\\nWhy? Ice age knowledge is a new discovery in science. Only in the 20    <sup>th</sup> century did scientists begin to develop an understanding of\\nthe subject. Even today it has more questions than answers. What then of\\nthe numerous ice age conditions found in Job\\'s pages? They have been\\nignored, spiritualized or disregarded! Consequently, believing Shem\\'s\\nchronology was complete, commentators for the last 2000 years placed Job\\nbetween Abraham and David, 500-1500 years too late.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSecular science has developed over 60 models for an ice age. There are so\\nmany because none work. They will be surprised when they finally realize\\nthat two opposite conditions are needed for an ice age, much heat and much\\ncold. Noah\\'s Flood provided both abundantly. Creation scientists realized\\nthis truth as they studied the Flood. The Flood pumped heat into the\\nworld\\'s oceans when \"all the fountains of the great deep burst forth.\" That\\nheat evaporated enormous amounts of water which fell as snow and eventually\\nproduced two-mile thick ice sheets. Then ash in the atmosphere kept the\\nsummer sun from melting the growing ice sheets. So how did the Flood cause\\noceans to become 40<sup>o</sup> warmer and summers 40<sup>o</sup> colder\\nand for these conditions to last for centuries?\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAlthough there is much mystery about the fountains of the deep, it is no\\nsecret that it is a lot hotter as you descend towards the center of the\\nearth. Whatever those fountains poured out heated the ocean. Additionally,\\nscientists discovered a 45,000-mile fault on the bottom of the deep oceans.\\nMolten rock that poured out of this fault also heated the ocean. But how\\ncould so much heat remain in the ocean for centuries? The Flood caused the\\nbreakup of the one continent. Over the centuries the pieces moved to their\\npresent location to become separate continents and islands. As the pieces\\n(or plates) moved, rock ground on rock to produce friction that contributed\\nto the ocean\\'s heat.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nContinual tectonic activity released volcanic ash which formed a thin layer\\nhigh in the atmosphere. Scientists have learned that volcanic ash impedes\\nthe flow of heat but not light. The ash in the sky reflected enough of the\\nsun\\'s heat back into space to drop summer temperatures by up to 40    <sup>o</sup> and over many years allow sufficient winter snow to accumulate\\nto form those ice sheets. Hence the Flood also supplied the opposite needed\\ncondition, the cold. When the earth finally settled down, summer heat\\nreturned and much ice melted. The Ice Age was over.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nUndeniable conclusions can be drawn from an ice age following the Flood.\\nFirst, since there was only one Flood, there could have been but one ice\\nage. Second, those who regard the Flood as local or regional have no\\nmechanism to produce the Ice Age and face the same dilemma the secular\\nscientists face. Yet secular science does not doubt that ice ages occurred.\\nGeologists have found no end of evidence for the Ice Age and that evidence\\ninvariably rests on top of the geological formations produced by the Flood.\\nClearly the Ice Age followed the Flood. Finally, the Ice Age supports our\\ncontention that Job\\'s ordeal occurred half a millennium before Abraham.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe warm ocean water grew a great plain of grass on the narrow strip of\\nland between the Asian Artic Ocean and the mountains further inland. As the\\nArk\\'s animal population multiplied elephants migrated to these distant\\nshores, attracted by its warm climate and abundant grass. Lacking natural\\npredators, they came to number in the millions and developed into a\\ndistinct subset of the elephant kind called Woolley mammoths. Eventually\\nthey became stranded, cut off from the world to the south. As the Ice Age\\nwound down, the intense cold, dwindling fresh water and lack of grass\\nspelled their demise. For centuries explorers thought they had drowned in\\nthe Flood. Recently, more careful examination shows they were buried in\\nloess, the dust produced by rock grinding on rock. Now their extinction is\\nattributed to that final period of the Ice Age when the ocean became cold\\nand grass no longer grew along those artic shores.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWhile Scripture focuses on the Flood\\'s water covering the entire earth and\\nkilling all air-breathing life outside the Ark, God also said that He would\\ndestroy the earth: \"Behold, I will destroy them [living things] with the\\nearth.\" Genesis 6:13. Because Scripture focuses on the destruction of life,\\nthis is the focus of <em>Hidden Beauty</em> as well as commentators in\\ngeneral. Of significance, however, is the destruction of the earth which\\nrefers to the impact of the Flood and its aftermath on the earth\\'s surface.\\nCreation scientists are adding to our knowledge of this second impact of\\nthe Flood.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nDescendants of the Flood survivors built the city of Babel and its tower in\\nLower Mesopotamia. God judged mankind by giving each major family group its\\nown language. Groups left Southern Mesopotamia to find land for themselves.\\nUz and his descendants settled in Western Arabia and established a region\\ncalled \"the land of Uz.\" As a major land owner in Uz Job would have been a\\nmember of this people group.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nFollowing the Flood new weather patterns that produced the Ice Age brought\\nsnow and ice to the upper latitudes while rain-drenching hypercyclones\\nripped through areas nearer the equator, even watering places that seldom\\nsee rain today. We previously mentioned the work of atmospheric scientist\\nDr. Larry Vardiman, a creationist who modeled these storms. With the\\nPersian Gulf at 95<sup>o</sup> his model showed that such a storm would\\nhave measured 3000 miles in diameter, lasted 18 days and dropped up to 300\\ninches of rain in Pakistan and 15 inches on lands that today are desert. It\\nis not surprising that many of Noah\\'s descendants sought out the Lower\\nMesopotamian Valley and even Arabia to escape frequent snow and ice storms\\nin the mountains of Ararat.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSome generations after Eber, his descendant Joktan found Arabia to be a\\nrefuge from much of this adverse weather. Although Arabia endured\\nhypercyclones produced by the Ice Age, they would have been preferable to\\nfacing growing ice sheets and months of unceasing ice storms in the upper\\nlatitudes. Joktan\\'s 13 sons populated Arabia and Job was still trading with\\ntheir descendants at the end of the Ice Age. While most of Arabia is a\\ndesert today and its population is small, it may have held a substantial\\nportion of the world\\'s population by the time the Ice Age reached its peak.\\nAbout eight generations after the birth of Job, Peleg, brother of Joktan in\\nthe broad sense of also being a descendant of Eber, was born in that\\ngeneral area. The ice sheets had melted. The Great Ice Age was over. Peleg\\nwas given the name which means \"divided by water\" because the oceans now\\ncontained the melt water from the vast ice sheets and covered the land\\nbridges, dividing the continents by water.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIt took over 2000 years for the earth to settle down and reach relative\\ncalm after the Flood. If this violence were charted the line would start\\nhigh on the left side, immediately plunge to represent the first forty days\\nof the Flood, then begin curving and reach almost horizontal after 2000\\nyears. Only 35-55 missing generations in Shem\\'s line provides sufficient\\ntime for this graph.\\n</p>\\n<p align=\"center\">\\n<strong>Progressive Revelation of the Names for God</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nOne last significant argument for dating Job early needs to be included\\nbefore closing this section of <em>HB</em>: the extensive presence of the\\nnoun \"Shaddai,\" an early form for the name of God. When Abraham (Abram) was\\n99 years old God made a covenant with him, declaring that he would be the\\nfather of many nations, that God would give the land of Canaan to his\\noffspring, that he would be called Abraham (father of a multitude), that\\nSarai would be called Sarah (mother of nations) and that God would give him\\na son through barren Sarah. He assured Abraham that He could do all this by\\nusing a new name-El Shaddai (Hebrew); \"God Almighty\" (English):\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    <sup>1</sup>\\n    When Abram was ninety-nine years old the LORD appeared to Abram and\\n    said to him, \"I am God Almighty [El Shaddai]; walk before me and be\\n    blameless, <sup>2</sup>that I may make my covenant between me and you,\\n    and multiply you greatly.\" Genesis 17:1-2.\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThis revelation was made about 2067 BC. Then 600 years later when God\\ncalled Moses, about 1447 BC, He made Himself known as Jehovah/Yahweh\\n(depending on vowel pointing) which is translated LORD in most English\\nBibles and means \"I am,\" the self-existent one, the One who always existed.\\nIn Exodus 6:2-3 God actually distinguishes when these two names were\\nrevealed:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    <sup>2</sup>\\n    God spoke to Moses and said to him, \"I am the LORD [I am-the eternally\\n    existing one; Jehovah]. <sup>3</sup>I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac,\\n    and to Jacob, as God Almighty [El Shaddai], but by my name the LORD\\n    [Jehovah] I did not make myself known to them.\" (Brackets ours.)\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nConcerning El Shaddai, God\\'s name first given to Abraham, El is the\\nmasculine singular form for God while Shaddai is a word with an uncertain\\norigin. The meanings of possible roots in various languages include power,\\nbreast (nourishment) and mountain but it is commonly rendered \"Almighty.\"\\nWhat does this have to do with Job?\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nShaddai was a name for God before He revealed Himself as El Shaddai to\\nAbraham. Shaddai is found by itself about 41 times in Scripture and 31 are\\nin Job. The compound name (El Shaddai) is found six times between God\\'s\\nrevelation to Abraham and his revelation to Moses 600 years later but\\naccording to Exodus 6:2-3, it was used frequently. It is found once later\\nin the Old Testament-in Ezekiel 10:5 when the Shekinah Glory departed the\\nTemple. Once the strongest word for God, LORD/Jehovah, was given, the\\nlesser words, Shaddai and El Shaddai were used infrequently. Since the\\nearly word for God, Shaddai, is found abundantly in Job, it suggests that\\nJob lived before Abraham. This progression is difficult to see because\\nMoses in his work of compiling and editing inserted the strongest name,\\nLORD/Jehovah, when appropriate in both the books of Genesis and Job.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<a name=\"_Hlk69804571\">\\n    <strong>Takeaway from Job: Creation, a Pathway to Faith</strong>\\n</a>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBiblical inerrancy does not allow relegating the book of Job to allegory or\\nmyth. It speaks of real people with real experiences. Job\\'s friends had\\neducated minds and spoke from a wealth of knowledge and experience. Their\\nearly place in the post-Flood history of mankind helps future generations\\nto understand more clearly that God has always instructed men in His ways.\\nUltimately the book of Job shows God\\'s love and concern for all His\\ncreation, especially those made in His image.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBut think on this: God has an ongoing relationship, almost unmentioned in\\nScripture, with the holy and fallen angels. Man needed to be aware of this\\nrelationship because it affects man. God holds assemblies for the entire\\npopulation of heaven and on two reported occasions, man\\'s devotion to God\\nwas in question. Satan, our accuser, is galled by our love for God. To get\\nthis idea out God threw His most prized human servant under the train. Then\\nto restore the trust of that servant, He made a personal visit to him and\\nallowed his four detractors to witness it. If that wasn\\'t enough, the visit\\nwas not to sympathize with that servant but to give a science presentation\\non creation and God\\'s providential care of it, the likes of which is\\nunequaled in biblical revelation or human history.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBut what about Behemoth and Leviathan? If the contest of heaven in chapter\\none and two of Job reflects the heavenly conflict begun before creation,\\ncertainly God\\'s reminder to us of the evil of Satan via literal dragons in\\nHis animal kingdom is not so hard to swallow. Such unity of Scripture is\\nits beauty. This relationship between Job and Genesis, dragons in Genesis\\nand Revelation, is but an early example of the Bible\\'s ongoing saga\\nregarding sin and God\\'s answer for it.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSo, on the one hand, finding this truth about God\\'s interaction with the\\nleader of the fallen angels in the book of Job challenges creation folks to\\nbelieve that Job lived when Scripture places him-after the Flood but\\nconsiderably before Abraham and even some generations before Peleg.\\nClearly, generations are omitted in Shem\\'s genealogy. As Hebrews 1:1\\ndeclares, God has revealed Himself \"at many times and in many ways.\"\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nOn the other hand, believers who say \"how old the earth is doesn\\'t matter\"\\nneed to move beyond that and see the importance of understanding all\\nScripture so that they may be \"thoroughly furnished unto all good works\"\\n(II Timothy 3:17). This includes these foundational truths of Satan,\\nrevealed in the Book of Job-his nature and tactics illustrated by living,\\ndangerous dragons which were not myths and did not die out or even live 65\\nmillion years ago but still populated the earth in Job\\'s day four and one\\nhalf millennia ago.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIs it too much to believe how highly God considers creation in helping our\\nfaith? Of course, unbelievers maintain the book of Job is late and a\\nproduct of the human mind. Yet how do they explain how man could formulate\\nthe science questions God Himself posed in chapters 38 and 39? They are the\\nstuff of modern science, today\\'s science. Some are even the stuff of\\ntomorrow\\'s science. Absent in Job are mythical exaggerations and errors\\ncharacteristic of ancient secular writings.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nNevertheless, believing in God can be hard. In our entire lifetime we will\\nnever see Him. In fact, in our lifetime billions of people will live and\\nnever see Him. Then God says that even one sin keeps us out of heaven. He\\nsays His son was judged on a cross for all our sins so that when we receive\\nthis substitute, God can forgive our sins and give us eternal life. That is\\nvery hard to believe. But while we can\\'t see God, and His salvation message\\nis foreign to human experience, we can see creation. We see His creation\\nfrom the time we wake until we go to sleep. We see people, animals,\\ninsects, mountains, oceans, forests and the sky with sun and stars.\\nCreation is that bridge to faith in the unseen God and His remedy for man\\'s\\nsinful condition. If the enemy wants to destroy us today, he has to get us\\nto think that creation has always been around, or that it made itself, or\\nthat it came to be in some other way than by the will and design of the\\nCreator. A vast enterprise works to keep such ideas circulating. But\\nholding evolutionary belief is becoming more and more ridiculous.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nCurrent science acknowledges DNA as the blueprint for life found in the\\ncells of all living things. But it is going haywire. Mutations keep\\naccumulating. Science knows some are really harmful and will take the life\\nof that living thing apart from heroic coping efforts. What happened to\\nnatural selection? Obviously it is a pipedream. So believing in God and His\\nsalvation should not be that difficult-it is mostly a matter of getting the\\nright information. At the least is taking the book of Job at face value.\\nAfter all, creation is the link between the seen and the unseen.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nLiterary giants have heaped their accolades on the Book of Job. Alfred Lord\\nTennyson called it \"the greatest poem, whether of ancient or modern\\nliterature.\" Thomas Carlyle said Job was \"one of the grandest things ever\\nwritten.\" Father of the modern creation movement Dr. Henry Morris II called\\nit the most remarkable book in the Bible. By confirming the absence of\\nnames in Shem\\'s genealogy, it has become even greater, grander and more\\nremarkable.\\n</p>\\n<div>\\n<br clear=\"all\"/>\\n<hr width=\"33%\" size=\"1\" align=\"left\"/>\\n<div id=\"ftn1\">\\n    <p>\\n        <a href=\"#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\" title=\"\">\\n            <sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup>\\n        </a>\\n        Morris, <em>Job,</em> 29.\\n    </p>\\n</div>\\n<div id=\"ftn2\">\\n    <p>\\n        <a href=\"#_ftnref2\" name=\"_ftn2\" title=\"\">[2]</a>\\n        Bernard E.

But Scripture also requires a correct object for\\nfaith. Christians are well aware of the disasters resulting from faith in\\nJim Jones and Joseph Smith. Faith in Jones took the lives of 900\\nindividuals while faith in Smith perpetuates a false gospel. This book\\nseeks to show that a complete faith that accepts the global Flood of Noah\\'s\\nday must include the way Scripture used Hebrew genealogies. This chapter\\naddresses the over simplified belief the that major earth movements were\\ncomplete by the Flood\\'s end. The most graphic representation of such\\nover-literal faith has the ark passengers descending from the top of Great\\nArarat which is 16,900 feet above sea level. Meanwhile it overlooks such\\nevents as the fire of God which took Job\\'s 7000 sheep over a thousand years\\nafter the Flood, the deepening of the Syro-African Rift in the Jordan\\nValley 2000 years after the Flood and even such secular memories as the\\nlost city of Atlantis.\\n</h1>\\n<h1 align=\"left\">\\nScripture identifies two events that brought on the Flood: \"all the\\nfountains of the great deep burst forth\" and \"the windows of the heavens\\nwere opened.\" Genesis 7:11. As a result, rain fell on the earth, ocean\\nfloors rose and continents sank until the ark floated (7:18). Through these\\nprocesses the water continued to rise until \"all the high mountains under\\nthe whole heaven were covered.\" Genesis 7:19. After 150 days of rising\\nflood waters, God took actions which stopped the Flood and removed the\\nwater. Scripture summarizes with \"The fountains of the deep and the windows\\nof heaven were closed, the rain from heaven was restrained, and the waters\\nreceded from the earth continually.\" Genesis 8:2-3. This, too, was not\\nimmediate but was a process.\\n</h1>\\n<p>\\nScripture gives the following detail of timing: The rain began \"In the six\\nhundredth year of Noah\\'s life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day\\nof the month.\" Genesis 7:11. At day 150 God closed the fountains of the\\ndeep and the windows of heaven (Genesis 8:1-2). At day 314 the waters were\\ndried from off the earth (Genesis 8:13). But the ground was dangerously\\nwet. At day 370, the earth had dried out (Genesis 8:14). \"Then God said to\\nNoah, \\'Go out from the Ark&#8230;.\\' So Noah went out, and his\\nsons&#8230;everything that moves on the earth went out.\" Genesis 8:15, 18.\\nThe Flood itself was a process that involved time, over one year.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe above verses assure us that four families and all the various kinds of\\nair-breathing land creatures had been preserved in the Ark. They also\\nrecord the timing and receding of the Flood. The Flood was the most\\nearth-changing event in all history. But to take from these verses that all\\nearth movements ended on day 370 of the Flood is an overreach of faith. The\\nfollowing pages will cite numerous instances of continuing earth movements.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<a name=\"_Hlk69827299\"><strong>Location of the Ark </strong></a>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n\"The ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat.\" Genesis 8:4. Since the\\nhighest peak in the Ararat range is Great Ararat at 16,945\\', tradition and\\nmany Christians declare Great Ararat as the landing place of Noah\\'s ark\\nsince the Ark came to rest several months before any other mountains were\\nvisible. But further information gives a very different picture. First,\\nGreat Ararat and Little Ararat (12,782\\') which is eleven miles distant are\\nvolcanoes. In fact, the entire region is volcanic. The plain to the\\nsouthwest of Great Ararat rises to 5000 feet above sea level while the\\nbroad alluvial plain north and east of Great Ararat rises to 3300 feet\\nabove sea level. Most importantly, the editor Moses wrote about 1400 BC, so\\nthe Ararat Range had two and a half millennia after the Flood to rise to\\nthe height of a mountain range.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nFor the entire ark contingent of thousands of creatures plus the eight\\nadults to climb down from the mountain and settle in some valley is an idea\\ngenerated by over-literalism. Noah and his family would have used supplies\\non the Ark to reestablish life. Making hundreds of trips back up the\\nmountain for all those supplies and materials would have been impossible.\\nWhat actually happened? God provided a hill higher than the other hills for\\nthe Ark\\'s landing. Noah\\'s family established a community on or near that\\nhill and began farming. As time passed volcanic eruptions in the area\\npersuaded the family to seek a safer habitat. As they safely exited the\\narea volcanic activity began forming mountains. As recently as 1840 AD\\nGreat Ararat erupted and lava flowed to increase its size. Today the Ararat\\nrange with its high plateaus is the result of 6000 years of volcanic\\nactivity.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Collapse of the Jordan Valley </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nTwo thousand years after the Flood, the Jordan Valley still resembled the\\nfertile Nile River Valley. Scripture even likens the Jordan Valley to the\\nGarden of Eden. This disclosure comes at the time Abraham and Lot parted\\ncompany because their herdsmen were fighting over the available land. Then\\na violent act of nature left the valley desolate. Here is how the area\\nlooked before this happened:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    <sup>8</sup>\\n    Then Abram said to Lot, \"Let there be no strife between you and me, and\\n    between your herdsmen and my herdsmen, for we are kinsmen. <sup>9</sup>\\n    Is not the whole land before you? Separate yourself from me. If you\\n    take the left hand, then I will go to the right, or if you take the\\n    right hand, then I will go to the left.\" <sup>10</sup>And Lot lifted up\\n    his eyes and saw that the Jordan Valley was well watered everywhere\\n    like the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, in the direction\\n    of Zoar. Genesis 13:8-10.\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIn Egypt the Nile overflowed its banks each summer as it carried water to\\nthe sea from the winter rains to the south. In doing so it fertilized the\\nsoil with a layer of thick, rich silt and replenished ground moisture,\\nproviding life-giving moisture to crops to be planted and causing life to\\nflourish in this dry area. Without life-giving water ancient Egypt with its\\npyramids, temples and tombs would not have existed. The same was true with\\nthat first garden God planted for Adam. A river flowed through the garden\\nand divided into four rivers, so great was the quantity of water God\\nsupplied.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIn the same way the land Lot chose thrived because it had an abundance of\\nwater. Scripture uses two words to describe the unusual quantity of water.\\nWhen it says the land was watered, it adds the adverb \"well.\" The land was\\nwell watered. But that still was inadequate so the word \"everywhere\" was\\nadded. Lot saw the Jordan Valley to be \"well-watered everywhere.\" It wasn\\'t\\njust the river that watered the valley because the valley was broad, a\\nplain. In addition to the generous amount of water supplied by the river,\\nit received an abundance of rain. Consequently, this valley was green,\\nlush, ideal for Lot\\'s herds. Then Scripture adds those two other lands\\nknown for their abundant watering. The Jordan Valley was watered like that\\noriginal garden God planted for man and like the well-watered land of Egypt\\nin that day.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nFollowing this highly favorable description of the Jordan Valley, Scripture\\nadds an onerous parenthesis: \"This was before the LORD destroyed Sodom and\\nGomorrah.\" Just 20 or so years after Lot chose the lush Jordan Valley, God\\ntold him to leave it immediately and flee to the eastern hills. The next\\nmorning the destruction began. It was an awesome earth movement. The two\\nsides to the valley moved in such a way that the valley dropped enough to\\nbecome the lowest place on earth. The event was accompanied by, an\\nunleashing of molten lava called \"fire and brimstone.\"\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nLot first took refuge in a town on the edge of the pentapolis. But then he\\nmoved to the hills God originally told him to flee to. While his time in\\nthat small town may have been short, maybe just long enough to get some\\nrest, it shows that this earth movement was a process. It progressed over\\ntime. In the morning it took Sodom and Gomorrah. As it crept closer to the\\nnearby town Lot had begged to stay in, Lot changed his mind and journeyed\\ninto the hills, out of the valley. Whether this was a day or a week, it\\nindicates that a process was going on. In the end Lot became a cave man and\\nhis two daughters spoke of a scarcity of men. This speaks of the desolation\\nof the area.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe event took most life in the area, caused the floor of the plain to drop\\nwell over 1000 feet and left the area a permanent blight on the face of the\\nearth. Abraham lived on a 2600\\' high plateau above this inferno. Even\\nthough he had lived there for 15 or so years and had good relations with\\nthe resident Amorites, he moved away. Why? Scripture doesn\\'t say but most\\nlikely the continuing smoke, fire and brimstone, earthquakes, etc.,\\ncompelled him to find a quieter area for his people and vast herds and\\nflocks.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe formation that this event produced or enlarged is called the\\nSyro-African Rift. While the tearing away of these two enormous chunks of\\nearth on either side of the broad plain may have started at the time of the\\nFlood, the work was not completed until 2000 years later. Because Scripture\\ndocuments so completely the before and after, this represents an undeniable\\nearth movement long after the Flood. Historically, few have really taken\\nScripture\\'s \"before\" description seriously. These 500 or so words are given\\nto help believers grasp the gravity of this event. It was not just a\\nvolcanic eruption. It was the movement of two enormous blocks of the\\nsurface of the earth and it mostly happened over a period of years in as\\nmuch as Lot is left living in a cave and his two sons remain in those hills\\nrather than moving to that formerly fertile valley. Today, apart from\\nirrigation, that area is barren and even features a sea of salt. While\\nthere had been eruptions before and an area of tar pits was not hospitable\\nto man, it only became desolate with this event.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Major Earth Movements Cited in Job </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nEntirely overlooked and explained as poetic license are the eye-popping\\nearth movements found in the Book of Job. The best known is the volcanic\\neruption that took away his sheep. Job 1:16 relates the event:\\n\"&#8230;There came another (messenger) and said, \\'The fire of God fell from\\nheaven and burned up the sheep and the servants and consumed them and I\\nalone have escaped to tell you.\\'\" The messenger had a term for the event.\\nIt was a part of his vocabulary which indicates that it happened frequently\\nenough that it was a part of that area\\'s vocabulary. He called it \"the fire\\nof God.\" This was 1500 years after the Flood. While not an earth movement\\nas such, vulcanism commonly accompanies earth movements.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nJob had 7000 sheep. A rule of thumb was one shepherd for each 100 sheep\\nwhich were kept in separate flocks and scattered widely so as not to\\novergraze. With the keepers would have been supervisors and support and\\npossibly even older sons maybe several hundred servants in all. Job\\'s ranch\\nis described in chapter nine. It was mostly desolate and rocky, covering\\npossibly 1000 square miles. <em>HB</em> estimates that his sheep required\\nabout 15 square miles of grassland. The grassland would be scattered over\\nthe ranch. So for this volcanic eruption to be 100% lethal, a volcanic\\nevent that today happens maybe once a century had to have occurred.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAnother messenger arrived to report \"\\'Your sons and daughters were eating\\nand drinking wine in their oldest brother\\'s house. And behold a great wind\\ncame across the wilderness and struck the four corners of the house, and it\\nfell upon the young people, and they are dead, and I alone have escaped to\\ntell you.\\'\" Job 1:18-19. These ten children of Job are called \"young\\npeople.\" That is a relative term. They are young in comparison to Job who\\nwas a generation older. They were his young people. Actually, they were\\nsemi-retired and spent much of their time enjoying each other\\'s company.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nFurther they were not in a tent but in a house. His children would have\\nimitated Job\\'s care in what he did, so this house would have been\\nwell-built. It would have been made of stone so it would be cool during the\\nhot weather. It would also be strong because strong winds characterized the\\nstorms of the time. Today the force of winds is rated according to wind\\nspeed and atmospheric pressure with a category five condition being the\\nstrongest. Satan managed to produce a wind speed and atmospheric pressure\\nthat collapsed the entire stone house. At the party were all ten of Job\\'s\\nchildren, so it is likely that other family members were present as well as\\na host of servants. The collapsing house killed every last person in it\\nexcept for a single servant.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe event could have been accompanied by an unmentioned earthquake. The\\nfire of God and a wind greater than those of today indicate a time of\\nincreased natural disasters and is consistent with greater earth movements\\nthan today. By our estimates Job was born about 1400 years after the Flood,\\nin the final days of the Ice Age. Since these two events (the Flood and the\\nIce Age) are unique to the entire history of the earth, we can more readily\\naccept other statements in the book of Job that are dismissed as\\nexaggerations or figures of speech.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nRepeated references are made to lightning and thunder. Job, Elihu and God\\nHimself all mention lightning and thunder and the thunder is said to be the\\nvoice of God. Elihu said the most about them:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    <sup>1</sup>\\n    At this my heart trembles and leaps out of its place. <sup>2</sup>Keep\\n    listening to the thunder of his voice and the rumbling that comes from\\n    his mouth. <sup>3</sup>Under the whole heaven he lets it go, and his\\n    lightning to the corners of the earth. <sup>4</sup>After it his voice\\n    roars; he thunders with his majestic voice, and does not restrain the\\n    lightnings when his voice is heard. <sup>5</sup>God thunders wondrously\\n    with his voice&#8230; Job 37:1-5.\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nJob asked, \"The thunder of his power, who can understand?\" Job26:14. Later,\\nGod asked Job, \"Can you thunder with a voice like his (God\\'s)?\" Job 40:9.\\nIndeed, God is the creator of all so He is the creator of the sound caused\\nby His creation. In this way the idea of thunder being the voice of God is\\nacceptable. No one would question that Elihu, Job and God are pointing to\\nliteral lightning and thunder. Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that when\\na speaker in Job refers to an act of nature, the speaker is referring to a\\nliteral event.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nNow, let us apply that idea to the following verse: \"How can a man be right\\nbefore God? &#8230;He who removes mountains, and they know it not, when he\\noverturns them in his anger&#8230;.\" Job 9:2, 5. God moved mountains in\\nJob\\'s day? Yes. Further, Job adds that they are turned upside down. It was\\nnot difficult to accept that the speakers above were pointing to literal\\nlightning and thundering. But to accept that Job was speaking of literal\\nmountains being removed and even overturned pictures a world far different\\nfrom today. Today that rarely happens. But in Job\\'s day it was a part of\\nlife. Over a thousand years after the Flood, mountains were commonly\\noverturned. Here was evidence beyond dispute that God was powerful and no\\nman could oppose his power.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBut maybe this is overreach. Maybe some mountains appeared upside down, so\\nthe idea was spread that God had overturned them. Possibly, except Job is\\nnot done speaking. He began this response by agreeing with Bildad on God\\'s\\npower. His next statement seems to confirm that in his day mountains were\\noverturned. He says in verse 6 \"Who shakes the earth out of its place, and\\nits pillars tremble.\" Here is the cause of overturned\\nmountains-earthquakes. But who hears of an earthquake that shakes the earth\\nout of its place, that causes the entire planet to shake today? When these\\nearthquakes occurred in Job\\'s day, the people in his part of the world\\nattributed them to God and they showed God was so powerful that it was\\nhopeless to think of opposing Him. Without question there was much earth\\nmovement during the Flood, but it obviously did not end with the Flood.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIn the discourse of Job chapter 14, erosion is used to illustrate how Job\\'s\\nhope is being worn away. But the erosion Job speaks of is far greater than\\ncurrent erosion rates. Job says, \"But the mountain falls and crumbles away,\\nand the rock is removed from its place; the waters wear away the stones;\\nthe torrents wash away the soil of the earth; so you destroy the hope of\\nman.\" Job 14:18-19. In Job\\'s day erosion caused entire mountains to\\ncrumble. This is super erosion. It was not confined to the waters of the\\nFlood. Such erosion was still happening in Job\\'s day, possibly 1500 years\\nafter the Flood. The Ice Age generated such rain storms. They were so\\npowerful they are called hypercanes, a super hurricane. One was modeled. It\\nshowed up to 300 inches of rain would fall in 18 days.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThese places and acts of nature in Job must be genuine since no one\\nquestions the following natural elements found in Job: land of Uz (1:1);\\nthe earth (1:7); deep darkness/thick clouds (22:13-14); cold (24:7);\\ndrought/heat (24:19); full moon (26:9); snow (37:6); ice (37:9); hail\\n(38:22); dew (38:28); frost (38:29); ocean surface frozen (38:30).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIn conclusion the Flood did not complete the reshaping of the world. This\\nprocess continued for centuries and even millennia after the Flood. Any\\nother take on the statements above is a rejection of those portions of\\nScripture and a denial of inerrancy. Scripture urges sound faith. Sound\\nfaith recognizes earth movements after the Flood that continued for a\\nconsiderable time but slowly diminished to the frequency of modern times.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Processes During the Flood </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe following section is provided as a reminder that even during the Flood,\\nGod used processes. For starters, the Flood took months to cover the\\nhighest mountains/hills, not an instant. No known commentary discusses how\\nfast the water would have to rise and for good reason. To do so one would\\nfirst have to know the elevation of the highest mountain before the Flood\\nas well as how much of the rising water was due to rainfall, to the lifting\\nof ocean floors and to the sinking of continents. None of these facts are\\navailable. But it is sobering to realize that rainfall as fast as one inch\\nan hour would only produce a rise of two feet in a day or 80 feet in 40\\ndays.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAccording to the Guinness Book of Records, the most rain in 24 hours ever\\nrecorded was 71.8\" (i.e., six feet). It fell on January 7-8, 1966 during a\\ntropical cyclone at the 9600\\' level of a French territorial Island in the\\nIndian Ocean. That is approximately three inches an hour. If that record\\nrate continued for the entire first forty days of the Flood, it would only\\nraise sea level by 240 feet, hardly enough to cover mile-high mountains.\\nMore likely the amount of rain that fell per hour was many times the modern\\nrecord. If 12 inches fell per hour, sea level would rise 960\\' in 40 days.\\nBut imagine what that would do to the roof of the Ark.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSinking land masses and rising ocean floors is another possible way to\\nraise sea level. The opening of the fountains of the great deep is listed\\nfirst in the biblical text while the opening of the windows of heaven is\\nmentioned second. The windows of heaven gave rain but Scripture does not\\ntell what the fountains of the deep gave. Possibly they involved massive\\nmolten rock pouring up from the mantle into ocean floors, thereby raising\\nsea level in a second way. This would explain why ocean floor crust is\\ngenerally younger than land crust. Secular geologists find former mantle\\nrock in many places on the surface of the earth, so in the past, magma did\\nrise to the surface of the earth\\'s crust. The ocean floor is only a dozen\\nor so miles above the mantle whereas the surface of land generally is about\\nfive times as much. This would be another reason for much of the magma\\nrising into the ocean rather than on land. Maybe those fountains raised sea\\nlevel considerably more than the rain from the windows of heaven.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWithout question unimaginable earth movements occurred during the Flood.\\nBut accounts in Scripture indicate earth movements continued after the\\nFlood. While their frequency and intensity decreased with time, the record\\nof Scripture leaves little doubt but that they did continue. Their activity\\nis clearly seen in the physical appearance of today\\'s earth surface.\\n</p>\\n<br clear=\"all\"/>\\n<p>\\n<strong> </strong>\\n</p>\\n\\n'},Ve={html:\"<h1>\\nChapter Thirteen\\n</h1>\\n<h2>\\nPeleg, Joktan and the Table of Nations\\n</h2>\\n<p>\\nFor two hundred pages this book has suggested that Hebrew genealogies are\\nmostly about identification, not succession, that they are often condensed,\\nthat 35-55 generations are missing between Eber and Peleg and that Job was\\nborn 8-9 generations before Peleg. Now Genesis ten appears, a fly in the\\nointment, two brothers to smite this tidy scheme. One brother continues the\\nline to Christ; the other populates Arabia. They are placed in the fourth\\ngeneration after the Flood.\\n</p>\\n<h3>\\n<a name=\\\"_Hlk69751449\\\"></a>\\n<a name=\\\"_Hlk69751462\\\">Two Brothers</a>\\n</h3>\\n<p>\\n<a name=\\\"_Hlk69751294\\\">\\n    <sup>25</sup>\\n    To Eber were born two sons: the name of the one was Peleg, for in his\\ndays the earth was divided, and his brother's name was Joktan.        <sup>26</sup>Joktan\\n</a>\\nfathered Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah, <sup>27</sup>Hadoram, Uzal,\\nDiklah, <sup>28</sup>Obal, Abimael, Sheba, <sup>29</sup>Ophir, Havilah, and\\nJobab; all these were the sons of Joktan. Genesis 10:25-29.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nNot so fast. \\\"Brother\\\" is one of those elastic relational words used in\\nboth narrow and broad senses. The narrow sense would mean these two\\nbrothers had the same immediate father and lived at the same time. The\\nbroad sense would merely mean they both descended from the same forefather.\\nNehemiah 5:1 uses \\\"brother\\\" that way. Poor Jews called rich Jews brothers.\\nThey were brothers in the sense that they were all descendants of Abraham\\nwho lived 1500 years earlier.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSimilarly, Peleg and Joktan were brothers in the sense that Eber was their\\nforefather. Genesis ten does not spoil the view of this book but provides\\nanother example to illustrate it. Both Peleg and Joktan descended from\\nEber. Peleg was born 35-55 generations after Eber but is named first due to\\nimportance (he continued the line to Christ). Much earlier Joktan and his\\ndescendants populated much of Arabia when Ice Age storms provided the water\\nto cover it with vegetation. Out of the millions born during the 35-55\\ngeneration gap, Scripture names only a few-Joktan and his 13 sons (who may\\nalso have been \\\"sons\\\" in the broad sense) and those found in the Book of\\nJob. This early populating of Arabia provides background for Job, the\\nPatriarchs and Israel.\\n</p>\\n<h3>\\nTable of Nations\\n</h3>\\n<p>\\nThe story of Peleg and Joktan appears in Genesis ten which is commonly\\ncalled the Table of Nations. That is a misnomer. It does not record the\\nrise of each nation after the Flood. It is neither a record of the\\nrepopulation of the earth, a genealogy nor a chronology. Rather it appears\\nfor a specific purpose and therefore is very selective. It was provided to\\ninform Israel of the background of her neighbors as the following will\\nshow.\\n</p>\\n<h4>\\nSelectivity of the Table of Nations\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\nFirst, the Table of Nations was extremely selective. On the Ark were Noah\\nand his wife plus their three sons and three daughters-in-law-eight adults\\nbut no children. After the Flood those three sons fathered 16 named sons\\n(5.33 sons per father) and presumably about that many daughters. This\\nrecord of first-generation sons is most likely complete. But with the\\nsecond generation the record becomes selective. From Japheth's seven sons,\\njust seven grandsons are named or just one son per father. Of Shem's five\\nsons, only five grandsons are named. Again, just one son per father. But of\\nHam's four sons, 26 grandsons are named (over six sons per father). Many\\nreasons are suggested for this such as not enough daughters to go around,\\nuntimely deaths, a preference for remaining single or even violence. Like\\nAdam and Eve's oldest, they all possessed old sin natures. But most likely\\nthe other nine had sons that are not mentioned due to selectivity.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIf the record of second-generation sons suggests selectivity, the record of\\nthird-generation sons shouts it-only three sons are recorded and two might\\nbe \\\"sons\\\" in the broad sense. Looking at this account another way, the 36\\nfirst generation sons should have produced 80 second generation sons. Those\\n80 should have produced 400 third generation sons. Instead of 400, just one\\nthird generation son is certain.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nGod commanded the Ark survivors to fill the earth with people. Either the\\nrecord is extremely incomplete or the human race was heading towards\\nextinction. Since repopulation was happening, the record is the problem. It\\nis selective. The fourth generation is even worse-only two sons are\\nnamed-the two brothers-and neither were truly fourth generation sons, so in\\neffect, no fourth-generation son is listed.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nLooking at this selectivity another way, Ham had four sons and sons are\\nlisted for three (75%). Shem had five sons and sons are listed for two\\n(40%). Japheth had seven sons, but sons for just two are listed (29%). What\\nbecame of the unnamed offspring of the other nine first-generation sons and\\n34 second-generation sons? Though not mentioned in Genesis 10, we know much\\nabout some from history. The Medes descended from Japheth's son Madai.\\nDescending from Shem's sons Elam and Asshur were the Elamites and infamous\\nAssyrians of Isaiah's day. But not all are so obvious. The identity of some\\nis disputed; others remain unidentified. Without question the Table of\\nNations is selective.\\n</p>\\n<h4>\\nPurpose of the Table of Nations\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\nThe Table of Nations is selective because of its purpose. These post-Flood\\npeople began to form people groups and nations. The record focuses on those\\nnations that impacted the Hebrews. This is the reason for the Table of\\nNation's specific content. Nearness to or impact upon the Hebrews was the\\nprimary reason in deciding which names to include. The most space was given\\nto Ham and his progeny. Both the Promised Land that God gave to Abraham's\\ndescendants and the surrounding nations were mostly occupied by them.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nHam's son Canaan first settled the land of Canaan. No less than 11 sons are\\nlisted for him. These names occur again and again through Scripture as\\nIsrael struggled with them. Ham's son Egypt and his seven sons settled the\\nland of Egypt. That land also had a major impact on the Hebrews. In Egypt\\nJacob's sons and grandsons grew to a population exceeding two million\\nsouls. Egypt eventually enslaved them. Descendants of Ham's oldest son,\\nCush and his six sons, are listed because they populated areas near Goshen\\nwhere the Hebrews sojourned in Egypt for 430-years. Moses, the editor of\\nGenesis, would have been very aware of Egypt's Cushite neighbors. No sons\\nare listed for Ham's other son Put most likely because they settled in\\nlands more distant from Israel.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWhile Shem had five sons the sons of only two are mentioned. Shelah\\ncontinued the line leading to Christ and while Aram and his four sons\\nprovide context for the history of Israel. This makes sense since Aram was\\nthe father of the Aramaeans who populated Syria among other places. The\\nAramaeans were very significant in the life of Israel. By the time of\\nChrist, the Aramaic language had replaced Hebrew in everyday life. Aram was\\nalso the father of Uz who established the land in which Job lived. To have\\npossessed a large amount of land in Uz, Job would have had to be a direct\\ndescendant of Uz. Shem's other three sons, Elam, Asshur and Lud,\\ncontributed huge populations to the Near East and all are named before Aram\\nbut, amazingly, nothing is said of them.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSons of just two of Japheth's seven sons are named. From Gomer came many\\nEuropean peoples; but maybe Gomer's three sons are listed out of respect to\\nhim as Japheth's firstborn. Another, Javan and his four sons, leads to the\\nGreeks and other Northeastern Mediterranean peoples. These would be\\nsignificant in later Hebrew history as the Israelites interacted with those\\nbordering the Mediterranean Sea.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nPuzzling is the naming of Cush's descendants, Sheba and Dedan who are said\\nto come from Cush's son, Raamah. Possibly Sheba and Dedan were named\\nbecause they settled in Arabia and later intermarried with the descendants\\nof Joktan and Abraham. They also are found in the Book of Job.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSince God would give Abraham's descendants the land of Canaan, they needed\\nto know about their neighbors and close relatives. Nearness to or impact\\nupon the Hebrews was the primary reason in deciding which names to include\\nin the Table of Nations. Yes, the Table of Nations was both selective and\\ndeliberate.\\n</p>\\n<h4>\\nOther unique features of the Table\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\nWhile the firstborn is usually named first, the Table places the record of\\nShem's descendants (Genesis 10:21-31) after those of Japheth (Genesis\\n10:2-5) and Ham (Genesis 10:6-20). Several times Scripture deals with less\\nimportant sons before getting to the most important son, the heir.\\nIshmael's genealogy (Genesis 25:12-18) precedes Isaac's genealogy (Genesis\\n25:19 and following). Esau's genealogy (Genesis 36) comes long before\\nJacob's genealogy (Genesis 46).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe amount of space given to the descendants of each of Noah's sons also is\\ntelling. Nine verses of names are devoted to ham's descendants (10:6-8,\\n13-18). Three verses of names are devoted to Japheth's descendants (10:2-4)\\nand seven verses of names are devoted to Shem's descendants (10:22-24,\\n26-29). In the midst of the 70 descendants found in Genesis ten,\\nconsiderable space is devoted to three developments. First is the rise of\\nNimrod and the expansion of his power (10:8-12, 5 verses). Second is the\\nterritory of the Canaanites (10:19, 1 verse). Third is Eber's two \\\"sons\\\"\\n(10:25-30, 6 verses). Thus in 28 verses of Genesis ten, 12 verses are\\ndevoted to an explanation of certain names rather than listing names.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe broad use of \\\"father\\\" is clearly seen in Genesis 10:21 which says \\\"To\\nShem, also, the father of all the children of Eber&#8230;.\\\" In this sense\\nall the children of the grandson (Eber) were the children of the\\ngrandfather (Shem). When did Shem initiate this line leading to Eber's\\nchildren, Peleg and Joktan? It began two years after the Flood when he\\nfathered Arpachshad. The time two years) was when he began the line, not\\nwhen he fathered Peleg just as the time in Genesis 11 was when the line was\\ncontinued, not particularly when the named son was born.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nPossibly Arpachshad enjoyed the unique honor of being the first person born\\nin the post-Flood world. While Scripture doesn't say that, it does say he\\nwas born two years after the Flood, i.e., after the beginning of the Flood\\n(Genesis 11:10) and does not indicate that another person was born before\\nhim. Surprisingly he is named third, not first, in the list of Shem's five\\nsons in the Table of Nations. Elam is the first name and Asshur is the\\nsecond. Both had an enormous impact on the Near East in their day.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nElam appears again and again in Scripture. By the time Abraham arrived in\\nthe Promised Land, Chedorlaomer, King of Elam, had extended his scepter all\\nthe way to Sodom and Gomorrah, one thousand trade-route miles west and\\nsouth of Elam (Genesis 14:4). Fifteen hundred years later Elam would be a\\nmajor part of the Persian Empire that ended the Babylonian captivity.\\nAsshur fathered the Assyrians that continued to be a great and powerful\\npeople in northeastern Mesopotamia. In terms of prominence these sons\\ndwarfed Arpachshad. Maybe that is why he is listed third even though he was\\nthe firstborn. Clearly, birth order does not always dictate the order in\\nwhich sons are listed in Scripture.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSons were sometimes named for famous forefathers or relatives. Two clear\\ncases are found right here in the very beginning of the repopulating of the\\nearth after the Flood. Cush's oldest son was named Seba (very close to\\n\\\"Sheba\\\") and his second was named Havilah. Cush had a grandson named Sheba\\nwhile one of Joktan's 13 sons was also named Sheba. Joktan named another of\\nhis 13 sons Havilah. Because the same names were used over and over in\\nBible days, one must be careful when identifying people in Scripture.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe Table names 13 sons for Joktan and 11 for Canaan. Frequently those with\\nmany sons had multiple wives. While Jacob fathered 12 sons, they came\\nthrough four wives. Abraham's brother Nahor had eight sons by one wife and\\nfour by another. Abraham himself had eight sons by three women. Esau had\\nthree wives to bear his 12 sons. King David had even more wives for his\\nmany sons. How many wives Joktan had in fathering 13 sons or Canaan had in\\nfathering eleven sons is not stated. It would be conjecture to say all the\\nsons of each father in this Table came from one wife. In determining\\npopulation growth, it would likewise be a mistake to average the listed\\nsons and then conclude that all males had an average of that many sons.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAfter naming five sons and two grandsons of Cush in Genesis 10:7, verse\\neight says \\\"Cush fathered Nimrod.\\\" Nimrod was not named in the list of\\nCush's sons but separately said to be fathered by Cush. This is a device\\nfor sake of emphasis. Scripture continues by devoting more text about\\nNimrod and his kingdoms than it does to the entire paragraph on Japheth.\\nNimrod's Babylon has opposed God from this early time all the way through\\nthe Book of Revelation and to the present day. Abraham's seed needed a\\nstrong warning about this kingdom that wars against God and therefore\\nagainst Israel. Here is the warning right in the middle of the Table of\\nNations. Genesis ten is far more than a record of the repopulation of the\\nworld after the Flood.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWhile this chapter is short (just four pages), it is extremely important\\nbecause it corrects a common misunderstanding about Genesis ten that\\nobscures the 35-55 generation omission between Eber and Peleg. Genesis ten\\nis not a Table of Nations. Rather, it relates the origin of people groups\\nthat would impact Israel in its mission of producing the Messiah.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nCritical to that purpose were Peleg and Joktan (Genesis 10:25-30). In the\\npast expositors noted that Peleg's name meant \\\"divided.\\\" They concluded his\\nname referred to the division of languages when God judged those building\\nthe Tower of Babel. A careful study of his name indicates the division is\\nassociated with water, not languages. Thus, he was named at the end of the\\nIce Age when the two-mile-thick ice sheet in the earth's north and south\\nhad melted, raising sea level to divide the continents and islands by\\nwater. Joktan was important because his descendants established one of the\\nearliest population centers during the Ice Age-Arabia.

While some folks maintain he had\\nbetter sources that have been lost since his day, just the opposite is the\\ncase. He adopted a wrong date for the Flood because his sources failed him.\\nToday\\'s Bible students need not be bound by his inferior sources and\\nresulting weak interpretations. This chapter looks at historical errors\\nwhich led to his incorrect Flood date while the next chapter identifies\\nerrors of interpretation that resulted from forcing the incorrect Flood\\ndate on Scripture. While most of these bad ideas have been mentioned,\\nseveral will be examined in considerable detail. But to start, here is one\\nnot previously told, a humorous one involving the Father of History\\nhimself, Herodotus.\\n</p>\\n<h3>\\n1. Inflated Numbers Regarding Pharaoh Khufu\\'s Tomb\\n</h3>\\n<p>\\nHistory reports that 100,000 slaves labored 20 years to construct Pharaoh\\nKhufu\\'s tomb called the Great Pyramid located near Cairo Egypt. The famous\\nGreek historian Herodotus whom Cicero called the Father of History\\nmemorialized this historical blunder. Although born in Turkey during the\\nPersian Empire Herodotus became a contemporary of Socrates in democratic\\nAthens. About 450 B.C. he toured Egypt and saw the Great Pyramid. His\\nEgyptian guide told him 100,000 slaves labored 20 years to build the\\npyramid. Herodotus marveled at the ego of a man who would expend such vast\\nresources to build his tomb. He said the Egyptians still hated Khufu for\\nforcing them to raise the pyramid and could barely bring themselves to\\nspeak his name. The historian carefully preserved those statistics for\\nposterity. For 24 centuries his statistics were repeated as fact millions\\nof times over.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nNow the truth is out-no slaves, no 20 years and no 100,000 workers.\\nHerodotus swung three times and struck out. In recent years new ways have\\nbeen found to get at the facts of pyramid construction such as studying the\\nremains of villages where the pyramid workers lived. An architectural firm\\nthat provides project management services for massive projects around the\\nglobe worked with archaeologists to research the issue. Their findings were\\npublished in the June 1999 issue of Civil Engineering Magazine under the\\ntitle\\n<em>\\nProgram Management B.C.        <a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\" title=\"\"><strong>[1]</strong></a>\\n</em>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWorking closely with leading Egyptologists in both Egypt and the United\\nStates, the team concluded that a paid full-time work force of 14,000\\ncompleted the Great Pyramid in under ten years. Five thousand of these were\\nhighly skilled-miners who extracted stones from quarries; stone cutters who\\nshaped each block on site; masons who prepared the mortar; carpenters who\\nbuilt the transport sledges and other tools; scribes who recorded\\neverything; soldiers who organized and supervised the work force; and most\\nimportantly, the officials and planners who brought the largest structure\\never made by man within one tenth of a degree of true north-three years to\\nprepare the site, five years for construction and two years for the\\nfinishing touches.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAssisting the full-time professionals, skilled craftsmen and general labor\\nforce were the 26,000 seasonal workers who transported the two and a half\\nton stones from the nearby quarries to the site and then moved them up to\\ntheir place in the pyramid. Debate surrounds these temporary laborers.\\nPharaoh was believed to be a god and, therefore, all his subjects would\\nbenefit from his successful advance into the afterlife. On the other hand\\nwere tax levies. Farmers idled by the annual inundation of the Nile\\nprovided a large labor force. Regardless of how willingly they worked on\\nthe pyramid, they were well cared for by ancient standards. Regulations\\nhave been found covering the maximum amount of work allowed per day, the\\nwages received and holidays each worker was entitled to. They were well\\nfed. Their rations included two jugs of beer a day. Animal bones in garbage\\ndumps brought the calculation of 4000 pounds of fresh meat provided daily.\\nThey probably ate better for this short time than during the entire rest of\\nthe year.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nA recent movie used a half-mile ramp on which to move the huge stones up\\ninto place. It\\'s a good thing Hollywood was not in charge of the project\\nbecause their method would have taken more material for the ramp than for\\nthe pyramid! Archaeologists discovered remarkable efficiencies-the ramps\\nwould have been a part of the pyramid itself-switchbacks or spirals up the\\nsides. Rather than using the huge labor-intensive stones to fill the\\npyramids, less expensive methods were employed. One was forming chambers\\ninside the pyramid and filling them with sand. Another was building the\\npyramid on a rock outcropping. A third was filling the interior with mud\\nbrick. These earlier pyramids received more care than later pyramids which\\nwere smaller, less well built and often hastily constructed.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAs to Herodotus, modern historians are remarkably forgiving, explaining\\nthat it shouldn\\'t be surprising that he got it wrong because by the time he\\nvisited the site the structure was already twenty centuries old and much of\\nthe truth about it was shrouded in the mists of history, concluding,\\n\"Indeed, many of the stories Herodotus relates to us are probably false!\"    <a href=\"#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\" title=\"\">[2]</a> Of how many ancient\\nauthorities whom Ussher consulted could this be said?\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThis obvious historical blunder, while totally secular in nature and\\nunrelated to the Bible, has an application to our subject, Ussher\\'s 2348 BC\\nFlood date. Clearly it is a matter of sheer faith to claim that Ussher had\\nbetter sources than are available today. Herodotus\\' blunder, repeated for\\nover 2000 years, advises us to take Ussher\\'s writings with caution. It also\\nhas a second application, one to do with early post-Flood populations which\\nwill be addressed in a later chapter.\\n</p>\\n<h3>\\n2. Deficient Text of Exodus 12:40\\n</h3>\\n<p>\\nBiblical scholars of the past failed to recognize the many missing\\ngenerations between Amram and Aaron partly because of a deficiency in the\\nMasoretic Text of Exodus 12:40. This error in the transmission of the text\\nallowed the view that 430-years elapsed from Abraham\\'s arrival in Canaan\\nuntil the Exodus and that Israel was in Egypt only 215-years. Ussher was a\\nvictim of his times and perpetuated that mistake in his chronology. Two\\ncenturies later Keil and Delitzsch could write that hardly an eminent\\nHebraist remains that still holds to the wrong text of Exodus 12:40.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nNearly 150 years since Keil and Delitzsch issued their commentary on\\nExodus, devout Christians are still writing books stating that the\\ndeficiency in the text of Exodus 12:40 is the correct translation. They\\nstand with the KJV which reads \"Now the sojourn of the sons of Israel, who\\ndwelt in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years\" (KJV). Because this\\ntranslation says that the sons of Israel sojourned 430-years, not that they\\nsojourned in Egypt 430-years, they argue that the location of the sojourn\\nwas Canaan as well as Egypt. From this incorrect rendering they spin an\\nentire web of misinterpretations to conclude that the Flood happened in\\n2348 BC or so. It took about twenty errors to end up with that conclusion\\nand that is why this book is so long. Each error is a battle in this web of\\nerrors leading to that faulty date.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe correct text should read something like the ESV: \"The time that the\\npeople of Israel lived in Egypt was 430-years\" (Exodus 12:40). Hundreds of\\nEnglish translations read this way. Obviously, this reading leaves no room\\nfor ambiguity. As to how this affects our subject, once the text of Exodus\\n12:40 was clarified all could see that more generations than Kohath\\'s and\\nAmram\\'s stood between Levi and Aaron. With this, biblical scholars\\nrecognized the practice of abbreviating Hebrew genealogies.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSome might be shocked, thinking that we are criticizing the Bible. This\\nhistorical error and the next two pertain to the transmission of Scripture,\\nnot the writing of Scripture. The doctrine of inerrancy pertains only to\\nthe original authors who were enabled by the Holy Spirit to be without\\nerror in what they wrote. Through the ages the Scriptures have been copied\\nby generation after generation of scribes, mostly as faithfully as\\npossible. But scribal errors as well as deliberate changes, which will be\\nseen next, entered the original writings on occasion to produce the\\nincorrect views and interpretations we address. Nevertheless, the standard\\nBible translations through the ages have always been adequate enough to\\nlead people to Christ and teach them how to live a godly life.\\n</p>\\n<h3>\\n3. Addition of \"and in the land of Canaan\" in the LXX\\n</h3>\\n<p>\\nDue to the above early corruption of the text of Exodus 12:40, it is not\\nsurprising that \"and in the land of Canaan\" was added to the LXX so that\\nthe 430-year sojourn would clearly span both the time in Egypt and the time\\nin Canaan. Below is an example of how a verse in the LXX OT went through\\ntwo languages to get to English. First the Hebrew text is reproduced. Next,\\nthe Hebrew was translated into the Koine Greek to produce the Septuagint\\n(LXX) about 250 BC. Then the Greek LXX was translated into English in\\nmodern times. Much earlier many other translations of the LXX were made\\nlike the Latin translation which Ussher used.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n. Here is how the LXX reads to this day (underlining ours):\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    The time that the people of Israel lived in Egypt <u>and Canaan</u> was\\n    430-years. (English translation of the LXX.)\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\nE de katoikEsis tOn uiOn IsraEl, En katipskEsan en gE AiguptO        <u>kai en gE Canaan</u>, etE tetrakosia triakonta. Exodus 12:40. (LXX\\n    translation from Hebrew.)\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>&#905; &#948;&#941; </strong>\\n<strong>\\n    &#954;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#943;&#954;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;\\n    &#964;&#969;&#957; &#965;&#943;&#974;&#957;\\n    &#921;&#963;&#961;&#945;&#951;&#955;, &#942;&#957;\\n    &#954;&#945;&#964;&#974;&#954;&#951;&#963;&#945;&#957; &#941;&#957;\\n    &#947;&#942; &#913;&#953;&#947;&#973;&#960;&#964;&#974;\\n    <u>\\n        &#954;&#945;&#953; &#941;&#957; <a name=\"_Hlk58577673\">&#947;</a>\\n        &#942; &#935;&#945;&#957;&#945;&#945;&#957;\\n    </u>\\n    , &#941;&#964;&#942;\\n    &#964;&#949;&#964;&#961;&#945;&#954;&#972;&#963;&#953;&#945;\\n    &#964;&#961;&#953;&#940;&#954;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#945;, (LXX\\n    translation-Greek letters with some pointing missing)\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe words \"and in the land of Canaan\" were added at some unknown point. The\\nphrase was either in the version of the Hebrew text used for the LXX or was\\nadded at the time that Hebrew text was translated into Greek. Since the\\nHebrew Masoretic Text of Exodus 12:40 bore its own corruption in Ussher\\'s\\nday, it more likely existed before the LXX was translated. Thus, it was a\\nstumbling block from before 250 BC until modern scholars were finally able\\nto get to the bottom of the corruption and establish the correct text\\nwithin the guidelines of modern scholarship.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSo whether the Church Fathers were using the LXX which included \"and in the\\nland of Canaan\" or the Masoretic Text with its textual deficiency, the\\nresult was the same: Israel was in Egypt 215-years, not 430-years; the Levi\\ngenealogy of Exodus six was complete; Hebrew genealogies do not contain\\ngaps; the Flood happened about 2348 BC. Between the corruption of Exodus\\n12:40 in the Masoretic Text which would have occurred before 250 BC and\\nthis deliberate addition in the LXX, the belief that Hebrew genealogies\\nwere complete prevailed and continue to be an article of faith to many in\\nthe creation movement today. By believing that the total time in Canaan and\\nEgypt was 430-years, the very words of God in Genesis 15 and Stephen in\\nActs 7 plus numerous events in the lives of Abraham and Jacob had to be\\ninterpreted in unusual ways.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nFurther, these errors led to the misidentification of Abraham\\'s birth\\ncountry. As a result, most everyone located Abraham\\'s birth place, Ur of\\nthe Chaldees, somewhere near Haran in north western Mesopotamia-the LXX,\\nJosephus, the Church Fathers, even the so-called prophets Muhammad and\\nJoseph Smith. Then came discoveries at an Ur 700 miles to the southeast in\\nBabylonia. Here was a city \"worthy of Abraham\" wrote archaeologist Leonard\\nWoolley. Most concluded this really was the country God asked him to leave.\\nMore recently scholars have had second thoughts. Claus Westermann sums up\\nthe case: \"[In the Bible] there is not a trace of any connection with Ur in\\nthe south; there is only the name.\"    <a href=\"#_ftn3\" name=\"_ftnref3\" title=\"\">[3]</a>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nOf course our interest is what the Bible says, which is considerably more\\nthan Westermann acknowledges. Like the controversy over the correct OT text\\nin chapter eight, this issue is not easily settled but we would concur with\\nAlan R. Millard who wrote \"The case for identifying [Abraham\\'s home town]\\nwith&#8230;southern Babylonia remains strong, although the available\\ninformation precludes certainty.\"    <a href=\"#_ftn4\" name=\"_ftnref4\" title=\"\">[4]</a>\\n</p>\\n<h3>\\n4. The Mislocation of Ur\\n</h3>\\n<p>\\nThe call of God to Abraham (originally Abram) contained four elements. God\\nsaid to \"<strong>Go from your country </strong>[1-Abraham must leave his\\ncountry, the land he lived in, behind]<strong>,</strong><strong>and your kindred </strong>[2-he must leave his relatives behind]    <strong>and your father\\'s house</strong> [3-he must leave his immediate\\nfamily behind] <strong>to the land that I will show you</strong>\\n[4-destination not disclosed; divine leading required].\" Genesis 12:1. Four\\ntimes the Old Testament names Ur of the Chaldees in speaking of this\\ncountry Abraham was to leave:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nHaran died in the presence of his father Terah in the land of his kindred,\\nin <u>Ur of the Chaldeans</u>. Genesis 11:28.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nTerah took Abram his son and Lot the son of Haran, his grandson, and Sarai\\nhis daughter-in-law, his son Abram\\'s wife, and they went forth together\\nfrom <u>Ur of the Chaldeans </u>to go into the land of Canaan, but when\\nthey came to Haran, they settled there. Genesis 11:31.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAnd he [the LORD] said to him [Abram], \"I am the LORD who brought you out\\nfrom <u>Ur of the Chaldeans</u> to give you this land to possess.\" Genesis\\n15:7.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nYou are the LORD, the God who chose Abram and brought him out of    <u>Ur of the Chaldeans</u> and gave him the name Abraham. Nehemiah 9:7.\\n(Emphasis ours.)\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nOf the three Genesis passages only the words of God in Genesis 15:7\\nspecifically states that Abraham was brought out from Ur of the Chaldees.\\nThe Nehemiah verse merely quotes Genesis 15:7 and contains no new\\ninformation. Genesis 11:28 says that Abraham\\'s brother, Haran, died in Ur\\nof the Chaldees which was the land of his kindred. Since Abraham was one of\\nhis kindred, it would also be Abraham\\'s land. In a similar fashion Genesis\\n11:31 speaks of Terah taking his family including Abraham from Ur of the\\nChaldees to go to the land of Canaan. So in a roundabout way four verses do\\nstate or imply that Abraham\\'s country was Ur of the Chaldees. (The ESV\\nrenders \"Chaldees\" \"Chaldeans.\")\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nNow for the historical blunder. The Septuagint (LXX) changed \"Ur of the\\nChaldees\" to \"land of the Chaldees\" in all four passages. This substitution\\nis repeated in the Samaritan Pentateuch. The well-established history of\\nthe Chaldeans exposes this to be an error. Thousands upon thousands of\\ncuneiform documents have been discovered in Mesopotamia, mostly in the last\\n100 years. Only in modern times have scholars learned to decipher them.\\nImportant here is the general record of Chaldean migration. Documents place\\nthem in Northern Mesopotamia in the second and third millennia BC. Not\\nuntil after 1000 BC did they come to be a dominant people group in Southern\\nMesopotamia.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe Ur of Southern Mesopotamia also has a documented history, in its case\\ngoing back before 3000 BC. Some claim it may have been the first city in\\nthe world. By 2800 BC it had a centralized government. By about 2100 BC,\\nfor a brief time, it was the wealthiest and most powerful city-state in\\nMesopotamia. Its location on the Euphrates River close to the head of the\\nPersian Gulf accounted for its great wealth as it conducted trading from\\nIndia to East Africa and controlled shipping entering the Euphrates.\\nSemitic peoples added to its Sumerian population during its growth years.\\nThus, the Semitic origin of Terah and his relatives fit this country\\'s\\npopulation profile. But erosion from the Tigris and Euphrates moved the\\nmouth of the Gulf further and further to the east. As Ur\\'s prime location\\nslipped away, so did its key to prosperity. Its population declined. Then\\nthe Euphrates shifted course and every direction from Ur turned to desert.\\nToday the ruins of Ur are in a vast desert plain 140 miles from the Persian\\nGulf.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nMeanwhile many other locations in Mesopotamia adopted the name \"Ur\" or\\nsomething close-Ura, Ure, Uri and Uri\\'m, etc., etc. Finally, there was a\\nday around 400 BC when the original Ur was abandoned. By the time of the\\nLXX, the location of Abraham\\'s Ur was forgotten but the history of the\\nChaldeans was known. It was common knowledge that back in Abraham\\'s day the\\nChaldeans dwelt in Northern Mesopotamia. So those producing or responsible\\nfor the LXX changed \"Ur of the Chaldees\" to \"Land of the Chaldees\" thinking\\n\"land of the Chaldeans\" would be clearer than \"Ur of the Chaldeans. Thus,\\nreaders would look for an Ur where the Chaldeans lived in the days of\\nAbraham-in Northern Mesopotamia. Scholars then looked at the many Ur\\'s\\navailable and decided it should be one around Haran (today spelled Harran)\\nsince Abraham\\'s party settled in Haran on their way to Canaan.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSanliurfa Turkey, today called the City of Abraham, was the most popular\\nchoice. Josephus preferred that site. A travel blog states \"In everyday\\nconversations, Sanliurfa is shortened to Urfa. The extension of the name\\nhappened in 1984 to recognize the part Sanliurfa played in the Turkish war\\nof independence [1919-1923]. \\'Sanli\\' means glorious...it is popular with\\nMuslims because the town is thought to be the birthplace of the prophet\\nAbraham.\"<a href=\"#_ftn5\" name=\"_ftnref5\" title=\"\">[5]</a> Muhammad\\nincorporated that identification into the Koran along with stories of\\nspecific things that happened to Abraham in Urfa. So the entire Muslim\\npopulation of the world is more or less duty bound to support this location\\nas the city where Abraham was born. Sanliurfa is a mere 23 air miles\\nnorthwest of Harran (the modern spelling for the biblical \"Haran\").\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThis historical inaccuracy also tripped up self-declared prophet Joseph\\nSmith. He saw Egyptian manuscripts which he said were written by Abraham\\nand Joseph. He translated these hieroglyphics and called the one with\\nAbraham\\'s writings <em>The Book of Abraham</em> which was later designated\\nby his Church as Scripture. In it are extremely unbiblical ideas such as\\nnumerous references to the \"gods,\" creation of the universe from previously\\nexisting material and that after sacrificing five virgins one of the\\nEgyptian priests tried to make Abraham a human sacrifice but that an angel\\ndelivered him. This was said to have happened in Urfa, Abraham\\'s birth\\nplace and home town so he fled to nearby Haran. Smith\\'s manuscripts\\ndisappeared for 100 years then fragments were found and positively\\nidentified. Both Mormon and non-Mormon Egyptologists examined them. They\\nwere first century funerary texts and had nothing to do with Abraham.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nMormon apologists continue to defend the idea that Abraham\\'s Ur of the\\nChaldees was none other than Urfa as the histories of Smith\\'s day taught.\\nAfter all, a true prophet couldn\\'t be wrong. Brigham Young University\\napologist Paul Hoskisson presents an impressive case for Urfa being the\\ncorrect location for Abraham\\'s Ur of the Chaldees.    <a href=\"#_ftn6\" name=\"_ftnref6\" title=\"\">[6]</a>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nModern Harran lies in the middle of a large, fertile plain divided up into\\nvisible fields of green crops as seen in Google Maps. It has a population\\nof 10,000 while the Harran district numbers 87,000. Sanliurfa has a\\npopulation exceeding two million and is located on the northwest rim of the\\nTurkish Harran District plain. The driving distance from Harran to\\nSanliurfa is 30 miles by the main highways none of which are direct. Today\\nno visible physical obstacle would prevent Abraham from travelling directly\\nfrom Sanliurfa (Ur) to Harran (Haran), but the topography may have changed\\ngreatly over the last 4000 years.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nOne obvious difficulty with this location for Abraham\\'s Ur is that it did\\nnot receive the name Urfa until Turkish times. The Greeks called it Odessa\\nwhile Syriac Christian literature called it Orhai. Another difficulty is\\nthe disproportionate distance between Sanliurfa and Haran (25 miles) and\\nthe distance between Haran and Shechem Canaan where Abraham journeyed next\\n(560 miles). It seems unproportionate for the first stage of the journey to\\nbe a mere 1/22<sup>th</sup> of the distance of the second stage. Strange,\\nfor sure. But if the first half of the journey began at the southern Ur\\nwhich is 700 miles from Haran, that would be proportional (700 for the\\nfirst stage of the journey and 560 for the second stage). But these\\ndifficulties have not stopped those who oppose the southern location.\\nNevertheless, this author cannot find any reason to support\\nOdessa/Urfa/Sanliurfa as Abraham\\'s city of birth.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSo, what difference does it make, whether Abraham\\'s country was a northern\\nMesopotamian area like Sanliurfa or the southern Mesopotamian city-state of\\nUr? It has to do with the purpose of God, all God said He would do through\\nAbraham in the original call. It is hard to see how that purpose could be\\nrealized if Abraham moved just 25 or 30 miles from his homeland, kindred\\nand relatives where those idolatrous influences prevailed.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAbraham did not reach Canaan until he was 75 years old. Those years were\\ndivided between Ur and Haran. We spent much of chapter three visualizing\\nthose years, first 55-60 years in Ur, then the next 15-20 years in Haran.\\nWithin that time period was his first experience of daily dependence on God\\nas he followed God\\'s leading for the 700 miles from Ur to Haran. Then in\\nHaran he began learning about the true God. Hebrews says he journeyed to\\nCanaan by faith (Hebrews 11:8-10). That faith in the true God was\\nestablished in Haran. There he began building altars as demonstrated by his\\nbuilding two altars immediately upon arriving in Canaan. There he won over\\nhis father\\'s house or at least a substantial portion of it to the true God.\\nThere he trained 318 born in his own house to be as skillful as any solder\\nin the army of Ur.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSince God was going to make of Abraham a people for Himself, Abraham could\\nnot reach Canaan until his father was out of the picture. Hence God kept\\nthe Abraham travelers far away from the destination until Terah died.\\nFurther, Abraham could not begin building the strongest possible\\nrelationship with God until he was totally away from the influences of Ur\\nthat continued from his birth until the move to Haran. Seven hundred miles\\ndid the trick. Then when his father died Abraham was prepared. God renewed\\nthe call and Abraham immediately followed Him from Haran to Canaan. The\\nbiblical evidence is convincing, that the location of the city of Ur, which\\nAbraham left, was located in southern Mesopotamia, many miles distant from\\nHaran or Urfa.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBut even before the change in the LXX, there was an earlier change in the\\nHebrew text. Merrill F. Unger believes that the original text, the only\\ninspired text, simply read \"Ur\" and nothing more. Then it was changed by\\nlater scribes to \"Ur of the Chaldees\" as Chaldeans came to settle in and\\ncontrol southern Mesopotamia. Nebuchadnezzar was a Chaldean. So, to point\\nto the right Ur, scribes changed the text in all four places. But Middle\\nEast scholars correctly observe that never, in any cuneiform document\\ndiscovered to date is \"Ur of the Chaldees\" mentioned. Never. If Moses were\\nusing materials from Abraham or his son Isaac or grandson Jacob, those\\npeople would have been filled with stories of the glory of the Babylonian\\nUr and the word \"Ur\" would be sufficient in their thinking to identify\\nAbraham\\'s home country. Here is how Unger explains this first change of the\\noriginal text:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIt was [not an anachronism, as many critics contend, but was] rather an\\ninstance of numerous archaic place names being defined by a later scribal\\ngloss to make clear to a subsequent age where and what these places were\\nwhen their history and locality had been forgotten.    <a href=\"#_ftn7\" name=\"_ftnref7\" title=\"\"><strong>[7]</strong></a>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWhen might this scribal gloss have happened? Most likely it happened as the\\nSouthern Kingdom of Judah got more and more into idolatry and its history\\nbecame more and more confused. It could have happened any time in the 300\\nyears preceding the end of the Babylonian Captivity. This was over a\\nmillennium before the tradition of the care given the text by the Masoretic\\nscribes.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWe started off with the change made in the LXX. But, as just shown, we\\nbelieve the text was changed twice, first as Unger explains, then as we\\nrecounted, after the demise of Sumerian Ur. But even further, we came\\nacross seven so-called biblical arguments (and undoubtedly there are more)\\nplus non-biblical arguments from modern scholars to support the Ur near\\nHaran and now these must be addressed.\\n</p>\\n<h4>\\nArguments against a Southern Ur\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\nIn defending the southern Ur Millard lists five arguments given against it\\nand answers each.<a href=\"#_ftn8\" name=\"_ftnref8\" title=\"\">[8]</a> First,\\n\"it is said that the southern Ur is too far from Haran.\" Millard argues\\nthat merchants and others routinely traveled long distances, that they were\\nusing major trade routes and gives illustrations. We think the biblical\\nanswer is that God was using this long distance to help Abraham learn to\\nfollow Him day by day and to get the party so far from Ur that it could no\\nlonger be an influence on them. Moving from Urfa to Haran, a distance of 25\\nmiles, hardly accomplished God\\'s specific command for Abraham to leave his\\ncountry. Urfa and Haran were all part of the same neck of the woods.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSecondly, they dismissively note the route from southern Ur to Canaan via\\nHaran is quite roundabout. Cyrus Gordon states this objection more bluntly:\\nhe refers to Genesis 11:31 which says they went out from Ur of the Chaldees\\nto go to the land of Canaan and then reasons \"by no stretch of the\\nimagination would anyone go from Sumerian Ur (in southern Mesopotamia) to\\nCanaan via Haran. A glance at the map shows that Haran is much too far out\\nof the way.\"<a href=\"#_ftn9\" name=\"_ftnref9\" title=\"\">[9]</a> The most\\nobvious problem here is the view that Terah knew before leaving Ur that the\\ndestination was Canaan. Such thinking completely disregards the clear words\\nof Scripture that Abraham was to leave Ur and follow God\\'s direction. He\\nhad no idea where God was leading him or where the destination was. Hebrews\\nsays it even more clearly: \"And he went out, not knowing where he was\\ngoing\" (Hebrews 11:8).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThird, Millard addresses the argument that Abraham\\'s nomadic lifestyle is\\ninconsistent with the urban setting of the southern Ur. Abraham had\\ncertainly enjoyed all the comforts of Ur. Millard then gives many sound\\nanswers, mostly centered around Abraham\\'s new purpose in life. The bottom\\nline is that Abraham looked for a better city, one whose builder and maker\\nwas God (Hebrews 11:10).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nFourth, arguments from the phrase \"beyond the river\" or \"crossing the\\nriver.\" It is true that if one journeyed directly from Ur to Canaan, one\\nwould not cross the Euphrates River. In chapter three we explained that the\\nsaying of crossing the river was like waving one\\'s arm to indicate a great\\ndistance. By following the leading of God, Abraham did cross the river, in\\nfact he crossed it twice- first to journey to Haran and then to journey\\nfrom Haran to Canaan. The statement is an expression for a great distance.\\nMillard says \"For anyone living in the Levant, Babylonian Ur would have\\nlain conceptually \\'beyond the river,\\' whatever the precise geography.\"\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nFifth, the Sumerian Ur is never called \"Ur of the Chaldees\" in any of the\\nnumerous references to Ur in the cuneiform tablets. We answered this\\nobjection above.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSixth, a more serious objection not directly listed by Millard but advanced\\nby Cyrus Gordon is that \"Genesis 24:4, Genesis 24:7, Genesis 24:10 and\\nGenesis 24:29 tell us that Abraham\\'s birthplace was in Aram-Naharayim where\\nLaban lived.\" <a href=\"#_ftn10\" name=\"_ftnref10\" title=\"\">[10]</a> This is\\ncompletely untrue. Rather than Abraham telling his servant to go to his\\n\"birthplace\" to find a bride for Isaac, Abraham tells him to \"go to my\\ncountry and to my kindred\" (Genesis 24:4). In 24:7 Abraham continues with\\n\"The LORD, the God of heaven, who took me from my father\\'s house and from\\nthe land of my kindred, and who spoke to me and swore to me, \\'To your\\noffspring I will give this land,\\' he will send his angel before you.\" Then\\nin 24:10 \"[The servant] arose and went to Mesopotamia to the city of\\nNahor.\" In 24:27 \"the LORD has led me to the house of my master\\'s kinsmen.\"\\nIn 24:40 \"[My master had said] you shall take a wife for my son from my\\nclan and from my father\\'s house.\" Nowhere does the word \"birthplace\" or\\nsimilar word appear. Gordon has overstated his case.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nNevertheless, there are words in the passage that need clarifying. When the\\noriginal call came, Abraham did leave his country (Ur) and kindred\\n(relatives). But his father refused for his household to be separated and\\nin effect he and his household accompanied Abraham on the journey to the\\nland of promise. When the leading of God stopped, the party looked for a\\nplace to live. Haran was nearby. It was particularly promising because it\\nbore the name of Terah\\'s oldest son who had died in Ur. We suggested in\\nchapter three that Terah had some earlier connection with this major\\ntrading center, possibly getting his start there and to commemorate the\\nwealth he had gained there, he named his first son after it.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nNow, a century later as Terah accompanied his son Abraham who was born when\\nhe was 130, he found himself in the vicinity of Haran. He had to make a\\nhome somewhere. He chose Haran. There they lived for the next 15-20 years.\\nAt some point Abraham\\'s brother Nahor moved to that general area with his\\n12 sons. Then another century passed. Terah had died long before in Haran\\nand now Abraham himself was 140 years old. He had lived in Canaan for 65\\nyears after living in Haran for 15-20 years. His brother Nahor was a\\ngrandfather and the scion of a large clan in the Haran area. The southern\\nUr had ceased to be Abraham\\'s country nearly a century before. So, in\\nsending his servant to find a bride for Isaac, he refers to the area around\\nHaran as his country and certainly that is where the remainder of his\\nfathers\\' house was and where his brother Nahor had moved to.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSo the references in Genesis 24 in no way declare Abraham was born in the\\nHaran area but they do recognize that he had moved from Ur to a new country\\nand his kindred came to settle there. Those who make this mistake, for the\\nmost part, even wonder if Abraham was a real historical person and\\ntherefore have little confidence of the details of his life provided in\\nScripture. So Genesis 24 is not evidence for Abraham being born in a\\nnorthern Ur. Gordon\\'s assertion that \"the Biblical evidence is by itself\\nconclusive in placing Ur of the Chaldees in the Urfa-Haran region of south\\ncentral Turkey, near the Syrian border, rather than in southern Mesopotamia\\nwhere it is located on so many \\'Biblical\\' maps\"    <a href=\"#_ftn11\" name=\"_ftnref11\" title=\"\">[11]</a> cannot possibly be\\nconclusive since his only evidence from the Bible is the distortion of the\\nbiblical reports.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSeventh, the order of events in Genesis supports the northern Ur. Genesis\\n12 comes after Genesis 11 that reports the move to Haran. So the call came\\nafter the move. We answered this argument in chapter three as well. It can\\nbe summarized as follows: often Scripture finishes one subject before\\nbeginning another, especially in Genesis. The fact that the call is\\nrecorded in Genesis 12:1-3 does not mean that it came after the events of\\nchapter 11. Rather, the Abraham section of Genesis begins with the call\\nbecause the call is the very reason for the thirteen-chapter section on\\nAbraham beginning with Genesis 12:1.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nEighth, Woolley\\'s \"glamorous/spectacular\" finds in southern Ur swayed\\npublic opinion. Granted. His successful excavations certainly pushed\\nthinking in the direction of his Ur. But this does not deny the biblical\\nsupport that we have offered for it being the true location of Ur.\\n</p>\\n<h4>\\nBiblical Arguments for a Southern Ur Overlooked by Scholars\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\nNow we must offer a final support from Scripture, one that does not even\\nappear in the scholarly articles so far examined. Stephen says Abraham\\nmoved to Canaan after his father died (Acts 7:4). Those who adamantly\\ndeclare that Levi\\'s genealogy in Exodus six is complete are forced to say\\nthe record correctly reports what Stephen said, but he was confused and\\nmisspoke. They are defending a 215-year sojourn in Egypt. A 430-year\\nsojourn in Egypt means that Levi\\'s genealogy in Exodus six is incomplete.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWhile this interpretative device (that Scripture correctly reports people\\'s\\nverbal errors) is sometimes needed, much other evidence must exist to\\nrequire its use. No such compelling evidence can be found except the many\\nincorrect interpretations that require this one for the sake of\\nconsistency. To the contrary Scripture says Stephen was full of the Holy\\nSpirit (Acts 6:5) and it speaks of his wisdom (Acts 6:10). His words must\\nbe accepted as inerrant and consistent with what the Old Testament says.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nLeaving Haran after his father died at the age of 205 also means Abraham\\nwas not the oldest son of Terah. Terah began fathering sons at the age of\\n70 but Abraham was not born until he was 130. This fact also is rejected by\\nUssher supporters. Stephen cites God in saying that Abraham\\'s offspring\\nwould be afflicted in a land belonging to others which is also incorrectly\\ninterpreted to mean in Canaan as well as Egypt by the Ussher view even\\nthough God promised Canaan to Abraham\\'s descendants.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBut Stephen\\'s belief in a southern Ur is seen in his clear distinction\\nbetween Abraham\\'s original country and living in Haran. Acts 7:2-4 records\\nhim beginning his comments with <sup>2\"</sup>The God of glory appeared to\\nour father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran,\\nand said to him, <sup>3</sup>\\'Go out from your land and from your kindred\\nand go into the land that I will show you.\\' <sup>4</sup>Then he went out\\nfrom the land of the Chaldeans and lived in Haran.\" Stephen clearly says\\nthat God appeared to Abraham when he lived in Mesopotamia and told him to\\nleave that country. Later Stephen calls it \"the land of the Chaldeans\"\\n(7:3). Then Stephen says Abraham did as God directed and lived in Haran.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSo in Stephen\\'s mind Haran was outside the country Abraham left.\\nMesopotamia was a vast area, so in journeying to Haran Abraham would have\\nto travel a vast distance to leave this vast country. The idea that Abraham\\ntraveled 25-30 miles from Urfa to Haran in obedience to God violently\\nconflicts with what Scripture actually says.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIn spite of the two changes to the text, Stephen still had the right\\nconcept. Abraham left his country of birth for an entirely new country that\\neventually became \"his\" country and, after his father died, God\\'s leading\\nreappeared and Abraham took the vast wealth that he had inherited from his\\nfather to Canaan.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWhile the location of Ur was lost for centuries of history, Christians\\ntoday need to focus on the fact that this portion of Scripture now makes\\nsense. Consequently, knowing the right location of Ur helps correct\\ninterpretative errors in the life of Abraham. In the same way the growing\\nbody of accurate information related to the Old Testament helps us to see\\nthe abbreviating of Shem\\'s genealogy and solving the strange situation of\\ntwo brothers separated by many generations, examined in the preceding\\nchapter.\\n</p>\\n<h3>\\n</h3>\\n<br clear=\"all\"/>\\n<p>\\n<strong> </strong>\\n</p>\\n<div>\\n<br clear=\"all\"/>\\n<hr width=\"33%\" size=\"1\" align=\"left\"/>\\n<div id=\"ftn1\">\\n    <p>\\n        <a href=\"#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\" title=\"\">\\n            <sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup>\\n        </a>\\nCraig B.

No single writer embraces all of\\nthese misinterpretations. Rather, they are found throughout creationist\\nliterature. But generally, the most errors come with the most dogmatic\\nincorrect positions. While not exhaustive this list covers the significant\\nmisinterpretations we have found.\\n</p>\\n<h3 align=\\\"left\\\">\\nInterpretative Errors Identified in Chapters 1-2 (Levi Genealogy; Four\\nWitnesses)\\n</h3>\\n<p>\\n1. <strong>Error</strong>: Levi's genealogy in Exodus 6 and Numbers 27\\n(Levi-Kohath-Amram-Aaron) is complete.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Correction</strong>\\n: 8-12 generations are omitted between the third and fourth names, i.e.,\\nbetween Amram and Aaron.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n2. <strong>Error</strong>: Israel sojourned in Egypt 215-years.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Correction:</strong>\\nfour witnesses testify to a 430-year Egyptian sojourn-God, Moses, Stephen\\nand Paul.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n3. <strong>Error</strong>: The Apostle Paul testifies to a 215-year\\nEgyptian sojourn in Galatians three and he is the most important writer in\\nScripture. There may be uncertainty about what the other writers meant but\\nPaul is clear.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Correction</strong>\\n: the first witness to 430-years in Egypt is God himself, the giver of all\\nScripture. What the Apostle Paul said can be interpreted to agree or\\ndisagree with God's words in Genesis 15.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n4. <strong>Error</strong>: The 400 years of affliction and servitude of\\nGenesis 15:13 included Abraham as well as his descendants.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Correction</strong>\\n: God assured Abraham \\\"As for you, you shall go to your fathers in peace;\\nyou shall be buried in a good old age\\\" (Genesis 15:15).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n5. <strong>Error:</strong> The affliction of Genesis 15:13 was as mild as\\nAbraham's and Isaac's friction with the Canaanites or the mocking of\\nIshmael at the time of Isaac's weaning.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Correction</strong>\\n: God revealed a far more severe affliction. It began with a \\\"dreadful and\\ngreat darkness\\\" falling on Abraham. This nightmare conveyed the real\\ncharacter of the 400 years of racial prejudice and exploitation to be\\nendured by his descendants in a foreign land.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n6. <strong>Error</strong>: Israel returned to Canaan in the fourth\\ngeneration as God said (Genesis 15:16). The four generations may have begun\\nwith Levi or Kohath or maybe they were just four generations in general.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Correction</strong>\\n: No four-generation scheme works. Here \\\"generation\\\" would be referring to\\nlifetimes, i.e., in four lifetimes Israel would return to Canaan.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n7. <strong>Error:</strong> The King James Version of Exodus 12:40 allows\\nfor a 430-year sojourn in Egypt and Canaan while the Septuagint states it.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Correction</strong>\\n: The correct text of Exodus 12:40 was uncertain until recent times. Now it\\nreads, \\\"The time that the people of Israel lived in Egypt was 430-years.\\\"\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Interpretative Errors Identified in Chapter 3 (Abraham)</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n1. <strong>Error:</strong> Abraham was the oldest of Terah's three sons.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Correction</strong>\\n: Terah fathered his first son at the age of 70; Abraham was born when he\\nwas 130.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n2. <strong>Error: </strong> In Acts 7 Stephen faced a hostile crowd. Maybe\\nhe was rattled or had a memory lapse but his words about Abraham are    <strong> </strong>incorrect.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Correction</strong>\\n: Stephen was \\\"full of the Holy Spirit\\\" (Acts 7:55). He spoke with \\\"wisdom\\nand the Spirit\\\" (Acts 6:10). He affirmed that God's call came in\\nMesopotamia, that Abraham moved to Haran, that after his father died, God\\nled him to Canaan and stated that God's 400 years of enslavement and\\naffliction would take place in a land belonging to others.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n3. <strong>Error:</strong> Abraham's country was Urfa or some other\\nNorthern Mesopotamia place near Haran.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Correction</strong>\\n: Abraham's home country was 700 miles SE of Haran, a place called Ur.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n4. <strong>Error:</strong> God's call came to Abraham after his father died\\nand he immediately followed God to Canaan.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Correction</strong>\\n: God's call came when his family lived in the Southern Mesopotamian\\ncity-state of Ur.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n5. <strong>Error:</strong> Lot was Abraham's young nephew.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Correction</strong>\\n: More likely Lot was senior to Abraham.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n6. <strong>Error:</strong> In Acts 7:4 Stephen is saying that 60 years\\nafter Abraham arrived in Canaan his father died. He returned to Haran and\\nbrought his father's body to Canaan for burial.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Correction</strong>\\n: When Abraham's father died, God led him to Canaan.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Interpretative Errors Identified in Chapter 4 (Jacob) </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n1. <strong>Error:</strong> Jacob was a wimp, a mama's boy and basically\\ndishonest.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Correction</strong>\\n: This line of thinking derails a true understanding of Jacob's many fine\\nqualities and adds to the confusion that results in support for a 215-year\\nEgyptian sojourn. Jacob submitted to the daily routine of successful\\nranching while his twin brother preferred the excitement of the hunt. Jacob\\nshowed faith in God's promises while his brother took them lightly. Jacob\\ncontinued to grow in faith through the years and God richly rewarded him.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n2. <strong>Error:</strong> Jacob received his two wives at the beginning of\\nthe 20-year stay with his father-in-law.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Correction</strong>\\n: Jacob served Laban seven years before receiving not one but both of\\nLaban's daughters in marriage.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n3. <strong>Error:</strong> Jacob's 11 sons were born in the order listed.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Correction</strong>\\n: Since these children were born in a ten-year period, as many as three\\nmothers were pregnant at the same time. So the writer listed them by mother\\nin two groups, before and after the resting period of Leah.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n4. <strong>Error:</strong> After a 20-year association with Laban Jacob\\nwithout even saying goodbye sneakily fled his father-in-law's ranch with\\nhis family and possessions.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Correction</strong>\\n: God told Jacob to return to Canaan. Jacob knew Laban would never let him\\ngo with his wives and children because in Laban's mind they belonged to\\nLaban, not Jacob. So Jacob had to flee when the opportunity was most\\nfavorable. Jacob exercised good, not bad judgment by obeying God.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n5. <strong>Error:</strong> The work contract between Laban and Jacob in\\nGenesis 30:31-34 marked the beginning of Jacob's final six years with\\nLaban.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Correction</strong>\\n: Laban frequently changed his contract with Jacob and the one that is\\nrecorded came just over three years before Jacob left Laban.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n6. <strong>Error:</strong> Dinah, Simeon and Levi all had to be older than\\nthey would have been if Jacob served Laban seven years before receiving his\\nwives.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Correction</strong>\\n: Dinah was raped when she was about 15 while Simeon and Levi were about 22\\nand 21 when they massacred the men of Shechem.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n7. <strong>Error:</strong> Rachel died in childbirth before the years in\\nShechem rather than after them.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Correction</strong>\\n: After leaving Shechem Jacob's party worshipped at Bethel and settled\\nthere as God commanded. When they set out to rejoin Isaac at Mamre, Rachel\\ndied near Bethlehem while giving birth to Benjamin.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n8. <strong>Error:</strong> When Jacob moved his family to Egypt, Benjamin\\nhad 12 living sons according to Genesis 46:21\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Correction</strong>\\n: Jacob's list included both those alive as well as those still in the womb\\nwhen his family moved to Egypt.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    Interpretative Errors Identified in Chapters 5-6 (Flexibility of Family\\n    Terms; Condensed Lists)\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n1. <strong>Error:</strong> Hebrew kinship terms express only immediate\\nrelationships.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Correction</strong>\\n: All of the common Hebrew kinship terms are used with great flexibility.\\nSuch terms as father, mother, son, daughter, brother, sister and even the\\nverb, to beget/to bear are used in both immediate and broad senses. Chapter\\nfive gives dozens of examples.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<a name=\\\"_Hlk53848223\\\">2. <strong>Error:</strong></a>\\nHebrew genealogies are complete.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Correction</strong>\\n: At times they are condensed.

About 20 names are omitted so only about one third of them are\\nrecorded.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    Interpretative Errors Identified in Chapters 7-8 (Shem's Genealogy; LXX\\n    or MT)\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n1. <strong>Error:</strong> Shem's genealogy is complete.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Correction</strong>\\n: It omits generations, especially between Eber and Peleg (from 35 to 55).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n2. <strong>Error:</strong> The numbers in Shem's and Adam's genealogies\\nprovide a biblical timeline of history.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Correction</strong>\\n: Scripture does not label them as such, nor does it say or even hint that\\nthey should be used for that reason. Of note, the Levi-Aaron list provides\\na clear pattern for how to understand factual information about the father\\nbefore omitted generations.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n3. <strong>Error:</strong> There is no large decrease in human longevity\\nfrom before to after the Flood.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Correction</strong>\\n: Those who lived and died before the Flood lived about 900 years, while\\nthe first three generations born after the Flood lived only half that long,\\nabout 450 years.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n4. <strong>Error:</strong> Noah and Shem outlived many named generations\\nborn after them.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Correction</strong>\\n: The 1300-1900 gap between Eber and Peleg means both Noah and Shem were\\ndead long before Peleg was born.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n5. <strong>Error:</strong> The Septuagint has the correct numbers for\\nAdam's and Shem's lists. Further, the LXX contains the correct OT text.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Correction</strong>\\n: The numbers in the Septuagint show deliberate manipulation. They are\\nartificial and thus disqualified from consideration. Find 12 other reasons\\nfor the MT numbers being the correct numbers and the MT being the correct\\nOT text (pp 135-137).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n6. <strong>Error:</strong> The authors of the Dead Sea Scrolls (DSS) were\\nEssenes, heretics who mixed Judaism with ideas from Eastern Religions.\\nChrist may have gotten his ideas from them.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Correction</strong>\\n: These ideas made famous by sensationalists are patently untrue. The 900+\\nDSS never mention the Essenes.

The Ussher chronology allows only 101 years for all the\\nevents from the Flood to the birth of Peleg. That period actually covered\\nroughly 1300-1900 years by our estimates. The activity during that period\\nwas both natural and human-natural: reestablishing the earth\\'s equilibrium;\\nhuman: repopulating the earth.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nNowhere does Scripture indicate that God miraculously restored the earth to\\nequilibrium once the Ark landed. Rather, Scripture describes events related\\nto the Flood that involved processes. After the Flood, mountains grew,\\ncontinents continued to move, oceans cooled and the Great Ice Age came and\\nwent. Creation scientists are spending lifetimes trying to understand\\nmechanisms involved in the Flood and the processes that followed. These\\nmechanisms took time to run their course, time which is not available in\\nthe Ussher scheme.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWhile Job was born nearly 300 years before Peleg, his country already had a\\nconsiderable history. All this human history won\\'t fit into 101 years. It\\ntook over two millennia for the earth to reach relative equilibrium after\\nthe Flood. All this natural history won\\'t fit into Ussher\\'s timeline\\neither. This chapter explores the immense amount of activity that can\\'t\\npossibly be crammed into the 101 years the 4000-year creation to Christ\\nview requires.\\n</p>\\n<h3>\\nNatural Activity Requiring More Time\\n</h3>\\n<p>\\nThe Flood began when \"all the fountains of the great deep burst forth, and\\nthe windows of the heavens were opened\" (Genesis 7:11). This brief notice\\nbundles a plethora of events that God said destroyed the earth (Genesis\\n9:11). Just what was destroyed? Not the planet; rather its surface on which\\nall life dwells. It took forty days to unleash forces that would ravage the\\nearth for another 110 days and resculpt its surface for centuries.\\n</p>\\n<h4>\\nHydroplate Theory\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\nRecently three creation scientists with impressive credentials have\\ndeveloped highly attractive theories for what was happening during and/or\\nafter the Flood. The first is Walter T. Brown who graduated from West\\nPoint, earned a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering from MIT and retired from\\nthe military in 1980. Since then he has worked on a mechanism he calls the\\nHydroplate Theory. His theory focuses on the phrase, \"All the fountains of\\nthe great deep burst forth.\" His research explores a world of water that he\\ntheorizes was trapped in a worldwide series of interconnected, subterranean\\nchambers 10 - 20 miles below the earth\\'s surface. All that water, he says,\\nwas equal to half of the water in today\\'s oceans.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe Flood began, Brown explains, when this water which was under enormous\\npressure broke through the miles of rock above. That initial penetration\\nthen spread at miles per second until a 45,000-mile-long crack developed in\\nthe earth\\'s crust, blasting great fountains of liquid and rock 20 miles\\ninto the sky resulting in massive torrential rainfall. Brown suggests that\\nsome of the material even broke free of the earth\\'s gravity and formed\\nasteroids that orbit the sun today.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThose who study the ocean\\'s bottom have discovered an enormous formation\\nthey call the mid-ocean ridge. Like the seam of a baseball this mountain\\nchain stretches for 45,000 miles. As possibly the most impressive formation\\non the face of the earth (up to two miles high, as much as several hundred\\nmiles wide and nearly twice the length of the world\\'s circumference), it\\ndemands explanation. Brown says the bursting forth of the fountains of the\\ndeep explains it.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIn Brown\\'s view when the fountains of the deep shot high into the\\natmosphere, the water cooled and fell over the Polar Regions as ice. Ice\\ncontinued to collect and spread until the upper latitudes were buried in\\nwhat has come to be called the Great Ice Age. He feels that Ussher\\'s date\\nof 2348 BC for the Flood does not allow enough time for this and the many\\nother processes started by the Flood. He has issued ten editions of his\\nbook, <em>In the Beginning</em>, through the years and hopes to issue one\\nmore in his lifetime. Whether he has identified the right mechanism or not,\\nBrown has demonstrated his faith in believing what God has said about the\\nFlood-that it was global and destroyed the earth. The body of Christ owes\\nhim its deepest gratitude for his forty some years of research and\\npresentations mostly at his own expense.\\n</p>\\n<h4>\\nCatastrophic Tectonic Plate Theory (CTP)\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\nJohn Baumgardner has developed a second mechanism for the Flood called the\\nCatastrophic Tectonic Plate Theory (CTP). Like Brown, his credentials are\\nvery impressive. He earned a M.S. degree in electrical engineering from\\nPrinceton. Later he completed M.S. and Ph.D. programs at UCLA in geophysics\\nand space physics for the specific purpose of trying to find the mechanics\\nbehind the Flood. He then worked in the theoretical division of Los Alamos\\nNational Laboratory eventually developing a program called Terra which\\nprovides 3-D modeling for the earth\\'s mantle.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nTo cause the Flood Baumgardner theorizes that the entire ocean floor\\nplunged to the bottom of the mantle and was replaced by molten rock rising\\nfrom the mantle in regional circular movements. In laboratory studies he\\nlearned that ocean floor rock which is primarily basaltic continues to grow\\nmore dense than continental rock which is primarily granitic. He says the\\nFlood began when somewhere this rock became so much denser where it joined\\ncontinental rock that it broke free and began plunging below the\\ncontinental rock in a process called subduction. Heat from rock grinding on\\nrock was sufficient to degrade the strength of the mantle rock below by\\nmagnitudes, allowing ocean floor rock to plunge all the way to the bottom\\nof the 1800 mile thick mantle.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThis initial point of subduction rapidly widened until the entire ocean\\nfloor adjacent to the great single continent was in the process of\\nsubduction. As the ocean floor worldwide was dragged to the subduction\\npoint, it stretched and then tore apart far from land. This tear would grow\\nto become 45,000 miles long. Molten rock from the mantle poured up into\\nthis tear, producing the formation known today as the mid-ocean ridge. This\\nmantle rock then flowed from the ridge behind the heavier subducting old\\nocean floor follow-the-leader style to become the new, lighter ocean floor.\\nBaumgardner estimates this process ran its course during the first 23 days\\nof the Flood.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nScripture cryptically describes the cause of the Flood in Genesis 7:11:\\n\"All the fountains of the great deep burst forth, and the windows of the\\nheavens were opened.\" While Scripture does not elaborate and no one knows\\nexactly what this means, \"Fountains&#8230;burst forth\" could refer to the\\nconstant explosions of supercritical water as it was forced from molten\\nmantle rock by pressure and heat. The Flood more than doubled surface water\\non planet earth. Before the Flood mountains and oceans were significantly\\nless pronounced. As both ocean water and this newly released water from\\nmolten mantle rock blasted miles into the sky, it cooled and fell as\\ntorrential rain described in the phrase \"the windows of heaven were\\nopened.\" Seeing the coming wickedness of man God would have designed the\\nocean floors with the threshold for failure to come at His appointed time.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nGoing back a little, the plunging ocean floors also dragged the edge of the\\ngreat continent down, beginning continental flooding. This process also\\ndisplaced ocean water, raising sea level and releasing water contained in\\nit. Flow in the mantle caused continental instability and sinking which\\nraised sea level even further. Earthquakes constantly shook the earth and\\ngenerated mile-high tsunamis that raced across the land depositing layer\\nafter layer of sedimentary rock sometimes thousands of miles across, strewn\\nwith the carcasses of dead animals some of which became fossilized.\\nFinally, the continent was flooded. Water stood above the highest\\nmountains.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nHowever, by the 150-day mark sea level had dropped sufficiently to ground\\nthe Ark. Still, the unpredictability of sudden tsunamis that rolled across\\nthe land produced by endless earthquakes from the movement of continents\\nand mantle made it impossible to disembark. It took 370 days from the onset\\nof the Flood until these convulsions decreased to the point where with\\nproper caution it was safe to leave the safety of the Ark. Then as the\\ncontinents lifted and oceans deepened greatly, the Flood came to an end.\\nThe Ark had come to rest on land that would continue to rise until the area\\nbecame known as the mountains of Ararat. Today\\'s great mountain chains\\nreach up to five miles above sea level. They didn\\'t exist before the Flood\\nwhen the highest mountains were possibly one or two miles high. They rose\\nas part of the great upheaval during and following the year-long flood.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nDr. Baumgardner says that the Catastrophic Tectonic Plate theory is both\\nscientifically sound and verified by field observation. Baumgardner has\\nsurrounded himself with likeminded creationists who continue to develop his\\ntheory. Like Brown, Baumgardner continues his research and writing and\\ndeserves the gratitude of the Body of Christ for his immense dedication to\\nGod who tells us of a worldwide flood in Noah\\'s day.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAs stated, God said the Flood destroyed the earth. He was referring to the\\nearth\\'s surface which was drastically altered by processes set in motion by\\nthe Flood. The most significant process to change the earth\\'s surface was\\nthe breakup of the great single continent into pieces which moved to their\\npresent location to form today\\'s continents and large islands. No one knows\\nhow long this process lasted, but it could have been centuries before the\\ncontinents completed most of their journey. At the same time mountains\\nrose, some formed entire mountain chains that reached for the heavens.\\n</p>\\n<h4>\\nThe One Great Ice Age\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\nFor centuries following the Flood, volcanic activity left a thin layer of\\nash high in the atmosphere which reduced the amount of the sun\\'s heat\\nreaching the earth\\'s surface. Meanwhile, immense heat from the ocean\\'s\\nfloors evaporated massive amounts of water which fell as rain at lower\\nlatitudes and as snow at higher latitudes. This combination of heat and\\ncold produced the Great Ice Age. Eventually ocean water would be stored in\\nice sheets up to two miles thick at the continent\\'s upper latitudes,\\nlowering sea level by hundreds of feet.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe Flood itself retooled the face of the earth with a new landscape. Then\\nmountains rose to give the earth a new topography as vast ice sheets\\nreworked formations produced by the Flood and the continental breakup,\\nproviding concrete evidence that the Great Ice Age followed the Flood.\\nWhere bands of arid lands exist today, rain fell during that time, at least\\nin many places, making that land productive. Even today\\'s Sahara Desert\\nenjoyed a measure of moisture for possibly a thousand years after the\\nFlood. The Ark survivors found Lower Mesopotamia and Arabia to be something\\nof a refuge from the growing cold of the oncoming Ice Age.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe first three generations born after the Flood in the line of\\nShem-Arpachshad, Shelah and Eber-do not show the stress of coping with\\nthese many hazards-continental movements, rising mountains, accompanying\\nearthquakes, lava flows and growing ice sheets-although they immediately\\nshow the halving of lifespans following the Flood. As explained in chapter\\nnine, before the Flood fathers were about 100 years old when they began\\ntheir families and lived an average of 900 years. The first three\\ngenerations born after the Flood fathered their heirs in their early 30\\'s\\nand lived about 450 years. Because it took hundreds of years for the Ice\\nAge to gather strength and for the mountains of Ararat to rise, it could be\\nthat the first generations lived half of their lifetimes near the Ark\\nbefore these processes began to take a significant toll on man\\'s strength.\\n</p>\\n<h4>\\nMissoula Flood Produced by the Great Ice Age\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\nIn the 1920\\'s a newly minted geologist proposed that a monstrous flood\\nswept through the Pacific Northwest of the United States. Professor J.\\nHarlan Bretz taught at the University of Chicago during the year but headed\\nwest to conduct field studies each summer. Bretz\\'s \"flood\" was a hundred\\nmiles wide, carved up an area covering one sixth of the state of Washington\\nand ran its course in just days. That sounded like the Biblical flood. His\\nfellow geologists accused him of \"heresy,\" betraying all that his\\nprofession had worked so hard to establish. Since Charles Lyell\\'s    <em>Principles of Geology</em>, published a hundred years before,\\ngeologists had been busy around the world identifying evidence proving that\\ngenerally, geological formations were produced by slow and gradual\\nprocesses over eons of time.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBretz\\'s hypothesis had one obvious flaw-no one knew where the water came\\nfrom. Over time geologists began noticing evidences of a lake the size of\\none of America\\'s Great Lakes in the Rocky Mountains of Western Montana.\\nYes, ancient shore lines were identified, etched on the sides of Mount\\nJumbo 900 feet above the modern city of Missoula Montana. As ice sheets up\\nto two miles thick melted, water collected for a hundred miles in deep\\nvalleys. When the ice dam to the west failed, the water rushed to the\\nPacific Ocean over a path 700-800 miles distant, carving what is today\\ncalled the Channeled Scabland. After 40 years of controversy the geologic\\ncommunity finally acknowledged that Bretz was right. The formations were\\ncarved rapidly, not over eons of time. But to this day their explanation is\\nstill colored with evolution\\'s long ages. One formation has 39 layers. Aha!\\nThirty-nine floods from many ice ages and eons of time! Creationists reply\\nthat those layers were laid down as water briefly backed up, washing back\\nand forth, depositing layer after layer, just as the Flood laid down\\nhundreds of layers in a single tsunami over vast areas.\\n</p>\\n<h4>\\nMassive Vulcanism and the Great Ice Age\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\nA third creationist Michael Oard spent his working years with the United\\nStates National Weather Service (NWS), eventually serving for 20 years as a\\nlead forecaster in the Pacific Northwest regional office at Great Falls\\nMontana. The skills of that office involves understanding the effects of\\nweather flowing out of the Gulf of Alaska and from the South Pacific to\\nimpact the very region where Bretz\\'s flood occurred. The rotating of the\\nearth causes these flows to produce cyclical periods of temperature and\\nrain fall. Oard came to his NWS position after earning bachelor\\'s and\\nmaster\\'s degrees in Atmospheric Science (1973) at the University of\\nWashington and then working there as a research assistant. Loving research\\nhe used the tools of the meteorologist to understand the Ice Age.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nHe was amazed that the geological world had developed over 60 models for\\nproducing an ice age. Why so many? None worked. They were all based on the\\nevolutionary time scale of slow and gradual processes. Only a cataclysm\\ncould bring on an ice age. Further, Oard felt that meteorologists, not\\ngeologists better understood the movement of weather flows essential to\\nproducing enormous ice sheets. Upon retirement Oard moved to the eastern\\nfoothills of the Rockies and conducted field work. Through the years he\\nconfirmed much of what Bretz and his fellow geologists had found. But it\\nlooked like one colossal flood produced by just one ice age. In the 1990\\'s\\nhe issued many monographs and in 2004 the semi-technical book    <em>The Missoula Flood Controversy and the Genesis Flood </em>in which he\\nwrote the following mechanism for how the Flood would produce an ice age:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe Flood involved unprecedented, wide-spread volcanic and tectonic\\nactivity. After the continents and mountains rose out of the waters [of\\nNoah\\'s flood], a shroud of volcanic dust and aerosols remained, obscuring\\npart of the sun. This would cause the land to cool dramatically. The dust\\nand aerosols would replenish themselves for hundreds of years following the\\nFlood due to continued volcanism as the earth moved toward equilibrium.    <a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\" title=\"\"><strong>[1]</strong></a>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe models of secular scientists lacked a critical element-cooling the\\nupper latitudes sufficiently to start and sustain the accumulation of ice.\\nSomehow heat from the sun had to be reduced significantly. Oard had found\\nthe necessary mechanism-vast volcanic activity begun by the Flood and\\ncontinuing for hundreds of years providing a thin layer of volcanic dust\\nand aerosols high in the atmosphere that would reflect back into space\\nenough of the sun\\'s heat to reduce temperatures to the critical point.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nYet it wasn\\'t like daytime was semi-dark for hundreds of years. As\\nexplained in chapter ten the wave lengths of heat and light are different.\\nDue to the length of light waves, light passed through this thin layer but\\nthe length of heat waves is such that they are significantly reflected back\\ninto outer space, lowering the percent passing through to warm the earth.\\nLight still fell on the earth. Both rainbows by day and stars by night\\ncould be seen. Lowering summer daytime temperatures was critical for an ice\\nage since they would have to be 30-40 degrees colder than normal in places\\nlike the U.S. mid-west city of Minneapolis Minnesota. In later years the\\nice itself reflected heat rays back into space. Only when the volcanoes\\nwere silent and the sun\\'s heat could overcome the ice\\'s reflecting work did\\nthe Ice Age come to an end. The Flood explains the Ice Age!\\n</p>\\n<h4>\\nExtinction of Woolley Mammoths Due to the Great Ice Age, Not the Flood\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\nA subset of Oard\\'s studies on the Ice Age is his collection of data on the\\nextermination of Woolley Mammoths. Many lived and died beside the Arctic\\nOcean especially in Siberia. Multitudes of their tusks have been mined and\\ntraded over the last 400 years. Early reports said they were buried in\\nsedimentary deposits. That sounded like Noah\\'s flood caused their\\nextinction. As Oard collected reports he found most were buried in loess,\\nnot flood sediments. Loess is the dust produced as ice sheets flow over\\nrock and grind it down. Loess pointed to extinction due to the Ice Age. If\\nthis were the case, the Woolley Mammoths would have died near the height of\\nthe Ice Age, not in the Flood over half a millennium earlier.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nHere is his idea on how they died: As the elephant kind multiplied after\\nleaving Noah\\'s ark, some wandered north and eventually found a home along\\nthe Arctic shoreline. This separated group interbred and developed dominant\\ncharacteristics unique to mammoths. Due to plenty of water, moderate\\nclimate, a vast stretch of grasslands adjoining the Arctic Ocean and lack\\nof predators, their population grew into the millions. But eventually the\\nocean cooled causing the climate to become drier and colder. Lack of fresh\\nwater and grasses stressed the animals. Intense cold and unbearable weather\\nmade crossing the ice sheets to the south impossible during the winter\\nwhile miles of bogs prevented moving south during the summer.    <a href=\"#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\" title=\"\">[2]</a>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe mammoths were trapped. Blinding dust storms (of loess) buried those\\nthat died from hunger or exposure and buried others alive. This entire\\nspecies of elephant was just one of many large mammal species that went\\nextinct due to the Ice Age. Oard finds the Ice Age useful in another way;\\nit provides strong evidence that the Flood was global.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nOard is clear about his view on how many and when ice ages struck our\\nplanet: \"The single Ice Age occurred rapidly within a period of about 700\\nyears following the Flood.\"    <a href=\"#_ftn3\" name=\"_ftnref3\" title=\"\">[3]</a> He gives substantial\\nevidence that the unique conditions for the one Ice Age produced by the\\nFlood would have taken much less time than the uniformitarian view which he\\nsummarizes as follows:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe Pleistocene ice age represents 30 or more successive ice ages (Kennett,\\n1982, p. 747). Each ice age supposedly repeats at 100,000-year intervals\\nfor the past million years and at about 40,000-year intervals before that.\\nIn these repeating ice ages during the past million years of uniformitarian\\ntime, 90,000 years represents a glacial period, while 10,000 years are\\ntimes of interglacial moderation. Uniformitarian scientists think we now\\nlive in a rapidly fading interglacial period called the Holocene.    <a href=\"#_ftn4\" name=\"_ftnref4\" title=\"\"><strong>[4]</strong></a>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWhile that last sentence has nothing to do with our immediate subject-the\\nfailure of Ussher and others to recognize that Hebrew genealogies are often\\nabbreviated-in a way it is our subject. Far more than the earth being 7000\\nor 8000 years old, our most basic subject is that God created the heavens\\nand the earth to establish man. Therefore, God will sustain the processes\\nof nature until the end. Just 30 years ago the scientific world feared the\\nonset of another ice age. Today that same universal scientific opinion is\\nthat man-made warming will destroy the world. Back then geologists found it\\ntook 90,000 years for an ice age to run its course. If the scientific world\\ncould not find a satisfactory mechanism for an ice age, how could it know\\nthat each one lasted 90,000 years?\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSeven hundred years is an ice age in record time and can hardly be made\\nshorter. It could be Shem\\'s genealogy in the biblical record was the\\nleading reason for determining its briefness. The ice sheets did not extend\\ninto Bible lands but they did affect their climates, producing much more\\nice, snow and rain than today. These altered weather patterns deposited\\nmoisture in bands a certain distance from the equator that mostly deliver\\ndry air today. Scientists identify depressions seen from space in the\\nSahara Desert that were once lakes.\\n</p>\\n<h4>\\nTime of Job: Waning Years of the Great Ice Age\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\nJob lived in what became an arid region of NW Arabia (now Jordan) and much\\nof the change from moist to dry climate had happened before his ordeal. Job\\nwas living in the waning years of the Great Ice Age. The process of forming\\nthose vast sheets of ice, producing large geological features as they\\nflowed across the land and finally melting while at the same time causing\\nthe oceans to fall 400 feet to expose a land bridge between Asia and North\\nAmerica and then rising to today\\'s elevation took many centuries. It\\ndefinitely did not fit in the 101 years from the Flood to the birth of\\nPeleg. The only place to fit it is the 35-55 omitted generations between\\nEber and Peleg.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe Ussher folks will simply say we are making all of this up. We certainly\\nare not making up the fact that the Book of Job speaks more about ice,\\nsnow, frozen lakes and torrential rains than any other book in the Bible.\\nThat weather was the experience of Job in his first 140 years and the\\nmemories of stories told by former generations. Genesis 12-50 covers about\\nthe same length of time as the first 140 years of Job plus his immediate\\nforefathers but instead of ice, snow, frozen lakes and torrential rains, we\\nread of drought and famine. Weather patterns cause wet and dry conditions.\\nThe Ice Age caused a wet pattern in areas that by Abraham\\'s day, long after\\nJob and the Ice Age, were dry.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBible students are for the most part unaware that the impact of the Flood\\nlasted for several thousand years. Even though God said \"never again shall\\nthere be a flood to <u>destroy the earth</u>\" (Genesis 9:11-emphasis ours),\\nfew have imagined what the phrase \"destroy the earth\" involved. As a result\\nthe standard view has missed the beauty of abbreviating Hebrew genealogies\\nthat allowed sufficient time for the earth to heal. On the other hand, God\\nrestated to Noah His original mandate to man to \"be fruitful and multiply,\\nand replenish the earth\" (Genesis 9:1). The earth\\'s surface would heal over\\ntime but man could immediately begin to fulfill the Creator\\'s plan of\\nrefilling the earth with His glory where the Ark landed. Later some would\\nhave to live in caves and others in a world of ice and all would have to be\\nvery careful as dangers lurked on every hand for hundreds of years.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nOard\\'s field work has focused on the results of the Flood rather than its\\ncause. He finds that Vertical Plate Tectonics (VPT) produced vast amounts\\nof rock stacked high all around the earth. These include the great mountain\\nchains of the world-the Himalayas, the Alps, the Rockies, the Andes. The\\nhighest mountain is nearly six miles high. Geologists acknowledge these are\\nall young by comparison with their estimate of the age of the earth.\\nNumerous formations never seen by most people lie on the ocean\\'s floors and\\nlikewise testify to a recent time of sudden mountain building and deepening\\ndepressions caused by the Flood.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nNorthrup (chapter 11) preceded these contemporary scientists. He was\\ncertain that the breaking up of the great continent also left distinct\\ngeological marks. This idea is not a major feature of the three mechanisms\\nabove. Maybe in years to come creation geologists will realize that it took\\nthe better part of several thousand years for the pieces of the great\\ncontinent to move to their relatively recent positions.\\n</p>\\n<h4>\\nThe Canopy Theory\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\nIn closing this section on the time involved in the various theories about\\nthe causes and results of the Flood, we should mention the Canopy Theory.\\nPrevious generations of Bible students noted that God separated the waters\\nbelow from the waters above on day two of creation week (Genesis 1:7). They\\nconcluded that the waters above formed an enormous transparent canopy\\nsurrounding the earth, producing a greenhouse effect that screened out UV\\nradiation, allowed great longevity and even produced a world-wide uniform\\nclimate. They concluded that the intense rainfall of the Flood was the\\ncollapsing of this water jacket surrounding the earth.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nToday, creation scientists reject this idea. Such a canopy could only\\nproduce a few feet of rain and would make the world too hot for life. While\\nthere may have been a thin canopy that screened out some UV radiation and\\nallowed great longevity, it would have added mere inches of water needed to\\nflood the earth and cover the highest mountains.\\n</p>\\n<h3>\\nHuman Activity Requiring More Time\\n</h3>\\n<p>\\nNow we will observe indications from Scripture of vast human activity\\nbetween the Flood and the birth of Peleg. Like the activity of nature, all\\nthat humans did could not possibly have happened if Shem\\'s genealogy were\\ncomplete and Peleg was born just 101 years after the Flood. While Job\\'s\\ngenealogy is not found in Scripture, his 280 year lifespan places him in\\nthe gap after the first three names of Shem\\'s list who each lived about 450\\nyears and before the next three who each lived about 235 years. Eber is the\\nthird name in the Shem list while Peleg is the fourth and Abraham is the\\ntenth. Job lived longer than any of the seven names in the Shem line\\nfollowing Eber. The entire Book of Job is a goldmine of historical\\nreferences pointing to much natural and human activity before his time.\\nSince we estimate he was born 280 years before Peleg and the Ussher\\nchronology only allows 101 years from the Flood to the birth of Peleg, we\\nmust firmly conclude that the Shem genealogy is abbreviated.\\n</p>\\n<h4>\\nFounding the Land of Uz\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\nThe very first verse of Job indicates much human activity: \"There was a man\\nin the land of Uz whose name was Job.\" Uz, whose land Job lived in, was a\\nsecond-generation descendant of Shem. He preserved the sound theology of\\nhis father Aram and grandfather Shem. While many rebellious descendants of\\nNoah built Babel and its tower, it is unlikely that Noah and his godly\\ndescendants such as Aram joined those who defied God\\'s command to fill the\\nearth after the Flood. More likely, as they saw the growing rebellion of\\nNimrod, they distanced themselves from him.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nUz eventually found his way to the region bearing his name, a sizable area\\nto the east and south of Canaan. Various people groups like the Edomites\\ngave parts of it their own names nearly two millennia later. Its location\\nwas still known in Jeremiah\\'s day, 1300 years after Esau. He wrote in\\nLamentations 4:21, \"Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, you who dwell\\nin the land of Uz.\" This is like saying \"Rejoice and be glad, O Frenchmen,\\nyou who dwell in Europe.\" Because Job was a large land owner in the land of\\nUz, he most likely was a well-known descendant in the Shem-Aram-Uz line.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe discourse between Job and the four who tried to help him give us\\ndetailed information about beliefs, conditions and events in that region of\\nthe world. After Zophar recited how God blessed the righteous and punished\\nthe wicked (Job 11:13-20), Job replied, \"Who does not know such things as\\nthese\" (Job 12:3)? The blessings and judgments of God were common knowledge\\nin the land of Uz. In 6:10 Job said, \"I have not denied the words of the\\nHoly One.\" Sound theology was still available in the land of Uz in Job\\'s\\nday.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSome will say our explanation about the founding of the land of Uz is\\nconjecture. Certainly if there is a fire, something started it. Or more to\\nour subject, if Job lived in the land of Uz, someone before him by the name\\nof \"Uz\" must have founded it. Who would say that second generation Uz was\\nnot godly, did not hold to the ways of the LORD and did not teach them to\\nhis descendants who carried his name throughout the region so that it\\nbecame known as \"the land of Uz?\" Job certainly was a distinguished\\ndescendant of Uz.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAs explained in chapter, ten conservatively speaking, Job\\'s vast spread\\ncontained eight thousand souls. Job was a chief city father of the nearby\\ntown. The references to it suggest it also had a sizable population. Job\\'s\\nfriends came from various adjacent regions and Job\\'s several hundred\\ntrading caravans required sizeable populations to service. It would not be\\nunreasonable to estimate that the land of Uz had a million residents.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nFor a comparable population growth, 520 years after Jacob fathered his\\nfirst son, Israel completed its forty years of wilderness wandering and\\nmoved into Canaan with a population of 2.5 million. The time from the Flood\\nuntil Uz founded the land of Uz must also be included. This period would\\nhave begun as the Ark occupants began learning how to cope with the new\\nclimate produced by seasons and how to grow food in the new soil.\\nEventually most moved away from the mountains of Ararat and settled on the\\nPlain of Shinar. Then came the ambition of Nimrod and the Tower of Babel\\nrebellion and judgment. At some point Aram would have seen the evil in\\nNimrod\\'s direction and moved his family westward. Eventually Uz founded the\\nland of Uz. All this activity took time, possibly 300-400 years. While\\nthese numbers are only estimates and could well be adjusted in either\\ndirection, one hundred years between the Flood and Peleg are far too few\\nfor the populating of the land of Uz. But 35-55 generations between Eber\\nand Peleg would be adequate.\\n</p>\\n<h4>\\nKings Who Rebuilt Ruins\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\nJob wished that he had died at birth. Then \"I would have been at rest with\\nkings and counselors of the earth who rebuilt ruins for themselves.\" (Job\\n3:13-14). Stories were passed on from generation to generation about these\\nkings who once lived and rebuilt ruins. Here a huge amount of human\\nactivity is implied. First we must go back to Job\\'s birth, nearly 300 years\\nbefore Peleg\\'s birth. If he had died at birth he would have joined those\\nwho had already died after a lifetime of great achievement. Add another 300\\nyears. Those ruins the kings rebuilt had once been cities that had sprouted\\nup and then failed. Add hundreds of more years. Before those cities began\\ngrowing all the years from the Flood until the dispersal at the Tower of\\nBabel had occurred. Add more years. It could not happen in 101 years but a\\nthousand years might be sufficient.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nEliphaz inadvertently refers to great antiquity in saying \"Listen to me and\\nI will explain&#8230; what wise men have declared, hiding nothing received\\nfrom their fathers to whom alone the land was given when no alien passed\\namong them\" (Job 15:17-19 NIV). Eliphaz was a contemporary of Job. He lived\\nin the well-known city of Teman which was southwest of Job\\'s ranch. The\\nwise men would have been the teachers in his youth and the fathers would\\nhave been the original settlers of the land. Job and Eliphaz were 140 years\\nold, the teachers would have been one or two hundred years older than\\nEliphaz and the fathers like the founding fathers of the US would have\\nlived hundreds of years before that. Then there is the time from the Flood\\nuntil Uz arrived in this land to begin populating it. Again, far more than\\n101 years.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBildad urged Job to \"Inquire of bygone ages, and consider what the fathers\\nhave searched out&#8230;Will they not teach you and tell you and utter\\nwords out of their understanding\" (Job 8:8, 10)? The Land of Uz was settled\\nby Uz, a grandson of Shem. This means Uz was born in the second generation\\nafter the Flood when people lived 450 years. For comparison Eber was born\\nin the third. These Land of Uz fathers lived ages before Job. Being the\\nfathers of the land of Uz and having lived in bygone ages suggests they\\nlived near the beginning of the settling of Uz or possibly a millennium\\nbefore Job was born. They established the sound doctrine in Uz that was\\nstill available in Job\\'s day. Job died about the time Peleg was born. Add\\nJob\\'s 280 years to the millennium before Job when these fathers were born\\nand it becomes obvious that Ussher\\'s idea that Peleg was born 101 years\\nafter the Flood doesn\\'t work.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIn rebuffing Job\\'s longest discourse yet Eliphaz asked rhetorically, \"Are\\nyou the first man that was born\" (Job 15:7) and \"What do you know that we\\ndo not know\" (Job 15:9)? Then he appealed to folks older than Job who would\\ntestify to knowing what Job had said: \"Both the gray-haired and the aged\\nare among us, older than your father\" (Job 15:10). Not all sons were born\\nwhen their fathers were just 30 or 35. This statement seems to suggest that\\nJob\\'s father was much older than Job. Having a son in one\\'s old age was not\\nunusual. Abraham had Isaac when he was 100 and Terah had Abraham when he\\nwas 130. Turning gray was a sign of advanced age while the aged were even\\nolder. Possibly these references point to people 150 to 200 years older\\nthan Job. Since Job was born 280 years before Peleg, the oldest of these\\ncould have been born 400 years before Peleg and the Flood would have\\nhappened another half of a millennium before that. Here is another instance\\ndemanding vastly more time than the 101 years between the Flood and Peleg\\'s\\nbirth.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Peleg and the Time Required to Build Babel</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAssociating Peleg with the Tower of Babel judgment is another difficulty in\\nArchbishop Ussher\\'s scheme. Peleg\\'s name generally means \"divided\" (Genesis\\n10:25). However, a careful study shows that water is associated with\\nwhatever is divided in the extensive use of the three consonants that make\\nup Peleg\\'s name, PLG. In searching for just how the earth could have been\\ndivided by water, the melting of the great ice sheets at the end of the Ice\\nAge immediately comes to mind. Unfortunately, Ussher missed that fine\\ndistinction and wrote that Peleg\\'s name referred to the dividing of tongues\\nin the Tower of Babel judgment, not water dividing the earth. It is\\nsupported with the idea that the city and Tower were well along by Peleg\\'s\\nbirth. This section will show that such an interpretation is physically\\nimpossible since there would not be enough workers. Just to have enough\\nworkers would require missing generations between the Flood and Peleg. Yet\\nthis faulty interpretation says the Genesis 11 genealogy has no omissions.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nFurther, Scripture implies that this division continued to be more and more\\npronounced during Peleg\\'s lifetime and centered on the earth rather than\\npeople. It sounds like a process that went on for years rather than an\\nevent that happened in a moment of time like God\\'s confusing the tongues at\\nBabel. Surely the division was about something other than Babel.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nOther than the specific meaning of Peleg\\'s name, the issue to examine is\\nwhether the Babel judgment could have occurred before Peleg was born or\\nnot. He was born 101 years after the Flood (101 AF) if the MT is a\\nchronology. The reason for thinking in terms of his birth is that names are\\nnormally given to children when they are born, not when they are grown.\\nCommentaries generalize that thousands of workers built the Tower. We will\\noffer half a dozen reasons to show that no such work force was available in\\nthe years shortly before Peleg was born. Such issues as the birth clocks\\nfor reaching adulthood, the effort and distraction of raising large\\nfamilies and the unwillingness of the godly to participate in the plan are\\namong the factors that required more time than those 101 years until God\\'s\\njudgment on Babel.\\n</p>\\n<h4>\\nBabel and its tower\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\nThe Flood released forces that covered the highest mountains and tore up\\nthe face of the earth. Five months after it began the waters started\\ndecreasing and the ark became grounded. The constant pitching and rolling\\nof that gigantic floating barge in heavy seas was over. But it was not safe\\nto disembark for over seven more months. Consequently, they lived on the\\nark for over a year.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nProvisions stored in the ark fed the eight people until they could\\nestablish flocks, field crops, vineyards and orchards. Over the years they\\nraised families, stripped the ark of whatever they could use and explored\\ntheir new world. Active volcanoes nearby caused them to think about finding\\na more suitable land. Eventually they started a migration which ended\\n400-500 miles south of the mountains of Ararat where the ark had come to\\nrest. The duration of this migration is unknown. The Ararat region\\ncontinued to rise until the tallest mountain, Greater Ararat, reached its\\npresent height of 17,000 feet.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nNoah\\'s extended and growing family settled on a broad plain named Shinar.\\nIt was as wide as the valleys of Arafat were narrow. When their population\\nwas sufficient some decided to build a city with a tall tower that would\\nreach to the sky \"lest we be disbursed over the face of the whole earth\"\\n(Genesis 11:4). Their statement suggests an awareness of the vast size of\\nthe earth which would have come from considerable exploration. The tower\\nwould be a landmark, seen from miles away. Rather than clay bricks dried in\\nthe sun which were used for ordinary construction, it would be built of\\nbricks that were burned to stone in an oven. While such a process would be\\nfar more labor intensive, the results would be more permanent. Their plan\\nshowed ingenuity and purpose but dismissed the direct command of God to \"be\\nfruitful and multiply and fill the earth\" (Genesis 9:1). It was rebellion\\nto the core.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nDid everyone join this rebellion? Noah would not join in a flagrant\\nrebellion against the God who had led him to build the ark and save life\\nfrom the Flood. He is named with Job and Daniel as among the most righteous\\nmen in history (Ezekiel 14:14). What about Shem, Aram and godly Uz?\\nScripture often generalizes. Note the language of Genesis 11:2: \"as people\\nmigrated from the east, they found a plain.\" This would be like Matthew\\n3:5, \"Then Jerusalem and all Judea...were going out to him [John...to be\\nbaptized].\" It simply means a large number were going down to John to be\\nbaptized. Obviously, only a part of the post Flood population joined the\\nrebellion. But who was its leader?\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe Table of Nations gives much space to a man named Nimrod who was born in\\nthe second generation after the Flood. His name means \"rebellion\" so\\npossibly this was a nickname given to him in adulthood. Scripture even says\\nhis empire began with Babel (Genesis 10:10). He was the world\\'s first\\niron-fisted dictator. Certainly the godly avoided this rebellion against\\nGod and others later escaped his tyranny.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWhile most commentators link Nimrod to the tower plan, some realize he\\nwould have been too young to gain the respect and leadership of the world\\nby the time Peleg was born 101 years after the Flood, so they suggest the\\ncity and tower were built in Peleg\\'s lifetime rather than before his birth.\\nLater we will cite Keil and Delitzsch who felt it could be done in 150 or\\n180 years. Some dismiss Nimrod by pleading the argument from silence-that\\nScripture does not say specifically that he was or became the leader of\\nthis cause and conclude he was not a leader of the Babel rebellion. Of\\ncourse the argument from silence works both ways. It neither names the\\nleaders nor clarifies that Nimrod, to whom it gave much space, was not\\ninvolved in this rebellion. Nevertheless, if Nimrod were the leader, his\\nyouth would provide another argument supporting our position that the\\nbuilding of the tower and city could not have happened so soon after the\\nFlood.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThose supporting the 101-year position argue that the city and tower did\\nnot have to be completed. In fact, they claim, it would be sufficient for\\nonly the base of the tower to be laid. However, this seems to oppose\\nGenesis 11:5, \"The LORD came down to see the city and the tower which the\\nchildren of man <strong>had</strong> built\" (emphasis ours). The words make\\nit sound like it was at least substantially well along. However, the\\nproject was not finished because when God confused their language,\\nScripture says \"they left off building the city.\" Possibly they built the\\ntower first and then proceeded to work on the city.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nArtists have rendered beautiful pictures of a monstrous tower and vast\\ncity. Ancient writings describe Babylon with such a tower. But the ruins of\\nBabel have not been located. It is unknown if the ruins of Babylon are the\\nsame as Babel. While the secular world is well aware of ancient Babylon, it\\ndismisses the entire Babel story as myth.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nScripture does seem to indicate that the eight ark passengers and their\\ndescendants initially stayed together and settled on the plain of Shinar.\\nHatching the idea of constructing a city and tower came after the\\nmigration. When God did confuse the tongues, it seems many language groups\\nwere created. This would be consistent with a large labor force\\nconstructing the city and tower. Next we will see just how many workers\\nwere available ten years before Peleg\\'s birth.\\n</p>\\n<h4>\\nThe Great Pyramid and the Tower of Babel\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\nThe work force needed for the Tower of Babel can be somewhat guided by the\\nwell-known data for building Egyptian pyramids. The formula for the volume\\nof a pyramid is height times width times depth times 1/3. Khufu\\'s pyramid\\nwas originally 481 feet high and 756 feet on a side, fixing its volume at\\n91.636 million cubic feet. It was the largest structure made by man until\\nmodern times. Of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, it is the only one\\nstill in existence although erosion has reduced it slightly.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSome Egyptian pyramids were stepped; others had smooth sides. On the other\\nhand, Ziggurats, also called temple towers, were massive tiered structures.\\nEach higher level was recessed from the one below enabling staging during\\nconstruction. Some 130 pyramids have been found in Egypt while about 120\\nziggurats have been located in Iraq and western Iran. The base of a\\nziggurat is equal to its height while the base of a pyramid is about 1.5\\ntimes its height. A 200 foot high Tower of Babel would have had a volume of\\n2,666,667 cubic feet or about 2.91% of Khufu\\'s Great Pyramid.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nMost of the effort of pyramid construction is made in the lowest portion of\\nthe pyramid. For the tower of Babel to reach even 20% of its proposed\\nheight would have required half the labor needed to complete it. If God\\njudged the people when it was only 100 feet high, it would have been 87.51%\\ncomplete and have a volume of 2,333,667 cubic feet which is 2.5467% of a\\n100% completed Great Pyramid. That percent of the Great Pyramid\\'s 14,000\\nfull-time and 26,000 seasonal workers comes to 357 full-time and 662 part\\ntime workers for ten years.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nComparing the needed work force, however, is a far different matter. In\\ncomparing the Great Pyramid with Egypt\\'s earlier pyramids, archaeologists\\ndiscovered that the pyramid builders learned with experience. Earlier\\npyramids required far more workers for the same volume of material in the\\npyramid. The Tower of Babel was its builders\\' first such experience. They\\ncould have started it several times before an efficient construction method\\nwas developed, or they could have discovered mistakes that needed\\ntime-consuming corrections.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBesides the time needed to learn how to build a ziggurat, there was the\\nlabor-intensive material in the ziggurat. Most of the stones in the Great\\nPyramid were quarried nearby and much of the insides was filled with\\ninferior materials; the stones in the Tower of Babel were man made. While\\nsun baked clay bricks would require a minimum of labor, the bricks used to\\nconstruct the Tower were burned to stone. This made them extremely durable,\\nbut it also made them extremely labor intensive. Just delivering the wood\\nfor the ovens would have required an army of workers. So while the\\nequivalent of Egypt\\'s 14,000 full-time and 26,000 seasonal pyramid builders\\nwould have been 357 full-time and 662 part-time workers at Babel for ten\\nyears, their inexperience and costly material would have required much more\\nlabor per cubic foot of material. Possibly these considerations would have\\ndoubled the necessary work force. Besides this an even larger work force\\nwould have been needed to build the city. Altogether, several thousand\\nworkers putting in six days a week for ten years is not an unreasonable\\nestimate.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWhile archaeologists have not yet positively identified the site of Babel,\\nthe site of ancient Babylon is well known. Its ruins are about 68 miles\\nsouth of Baghdad, Iraq\\'s capital. Historical accounts describe a temple\\ntower that once stood in Babylon as having seven tiers, three staircases,\\ntopped with a temple of exquisite proportions and dedicated to the god\\nMarduk. It was called Etemenanki, \"The Foundation of Heaven and Earth.\"\\nHammurabi was said to be the builder of this ziggurat which contained the\\nremains of an earlier ziggurat and other structures. Over a thousand years\\nlater King Nebuchadnezzar built its final stage, making it 297 feet high.\\nToday only part of its base remains.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nZiggurats were places where the gods could visit and be close to the\\npeople, not places of public worship or a burial place for a head of state.\\nNebuchadnezzar built another ziggurat at Borsippa, 7 miles south of\\nBabylon. It was 231 feet high. Several tablets and a foundation stone\\nexplain that he built it on the same design as the Tower of Babel. In\\nanother text Nebuchadnezzar said, \"Nabu\\'s tower (Borsippa) should reach the\\nskies and be no less in grandeur than that of Babel.\" The many ziggurats in\\nIraq and Nebuchadnezzar\\'s inscription and tablets allow the reasonable\\nassumption that the Tower of Babel was in the shape of a ziggurat.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBecause of the difference between pyramids and ziggurats, comparing Khufu\\'s\\npyramid to Babel\\'s tower can only provide a rough idea of the laborers\\ninvolved in the Tower. But regardless of just how many laborers were needed\\nfor the Tower and city, the required work force would have been sizeable.\\nIn fact commentaries repeatedly state that thousands of workers were needed\\nto build the city and its tower. But as will shortly be seen, there were\\nnot enough workers so soon after the Flood. Those who think otherwise make\\nunrealistic estimates of population growth.\\n</p>\\n<h3 align=\"left\">\\nFinding Enough Workers to Build Babel (see also Table 16.1)\\n</h3>\\n<p>\\nThe rapid population growth view reasons that if each man had six sons and\\nsix daughters there would be enough workers to get the city and tower well\\nalong by the time Peleg was born. However, twelve children per father in\\nthe generations before the Babel judgment is both unsupported and contrary\\nto the experience of family size reported in Scripture. It is reminiscent\\nof the numbers generated to produce the several million Israelis in the\\nExodus in just 215-years or four generations. While it could be done if\\nevery female did nothing but have babies, that is not the way life works.\\nHowever, what was not possible in 215-years would have been possible with\\nan additional 215-years. As to growing a work force to build Babel, Keil\\nand Delitzsch are more realistic in suggesting that if each mother averaged\\nfour sons and four daughters, the city and tower could be built in 150 or\\n180 years.<a href=\"#_ftn5\" name=\"_ftnref5\" title=\"\">[5]</a>\\n</p>\\n<h4>\\nChanging body clocks for starting families\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\nIn seeking to find enough workers we will start by observing the remarkable\\nrecord of changing body clocks for starting families. The human body did\\nnot always have the same time clock for birthing children. For instance,\\nAdam and Eve apparently had children shortly after God expelled them from\\nthe Garden of Eden. They could have been just a few years old, but their\\nsituation is unique because they were created mature adults and were\\ncapable of having children immediately after God created them. They had two\\nsons and at least one daughter whom Cain married.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThen Cain murdered his younger brother Abel and God exiled him from his\\nparents. What is surprising is that Adam did not father his next known son\\nuntil he was 130 years old. The nine generations that followed had their\\nnamed sons when they were 105, 90, 70, 65, 162, 65, 187 and 182. Apparently\\nafter Cain murdered Abel, God reset the human clock for having children.\\nThe dial now sat at 65-187. Noah, who began fathering the sons who\\naccompanied him on the ark at the age of 500 may have had other sons at an\\nearlier age. Scripture does not say. If he did have his first son when he\\nwas 500, he was an exceptional case.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWe are told there were eight people on the ark-Noah and his wife and their\\nthree sons and their wives, but no children. Once they were off the ark\\nNoah\\'s three sons began having families. Scripture says Shem fathered\\nArpachshad two years after the Flood. Shem was 100. Barring some unknown\\nfactor, it is reasonable to conclude Noah\\'s sons had pre-Flood body clocks\\nfor having children. On the other hand, Arpachshad, who is the first named\\nson born after the Flood, had his first at the age of 35 and the next six\\ngenerations had theirs at the ages of 30, 34, 30, 32, 30 and 29. Now the\\nbody clock for having children was reset to 29-35. The body clock of those\\nborn before the Flood for reaching adulthood and starting families stands\\nin stark contrast with those born after the Flood-65-187 vs 29-35.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBy Jacob\\'s day males were starting families as early as the late teens. For\\nexample, Judah\\'s two oldest sons married before they were 20 and Judah\\nhimself fathered Perez and Zerah by his sons\\' widow, all by the time he was\\n45. Obviously, as longevity declined, so did the body clock for starting\\nfamilies. By the end of Moses day the average life span was 70, a whopping\\ndecrease of 375 years from those first three generations born after the\\nFlood. Thus, this decline in longevity was accompanied by a decline in\\nreaching adulthood. In the wilderness Israel conscripted every able-bodied\\nmale for its citizen-army at the age of 20 because this was the age of\\nadulthood and marriage by that day. All of this illustrates the continuing\\ndecline in the body clock for adulthood. Since we are talking about the\\ngenerations immediately after the Flood, we will use the age of 30 which\\nwas their approximate average age for reaching adulthood and marriage.\\n</p>\\n<h4>\\nTime needed to bear 12 children\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\nNext, we must account for the time needed to do all the work of bearing and\\nraising 12 children. At the rate of one child every two years each mother\\nwould be nursing one or more children continuously for 24 years and\\nstruggling with a pregnancy over 1/3 of the time while caring for her ever\\ngrowing family. Once her oldest children could help, they would be pressed\\ninto the family work force. During their child bearing years the 36 adults\\nof the first generation and the 216 adults of the second generation had\\nlittle time for much else than the essentials of survival, but we are\\ngetting ahead of ourselves.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nArpachshad, the first person born in the new world, arrived two years after\\nthe Flood, which some commentators take to mean two years after the Flood\\nbegan or one year after it ended. Scripture reports he had fifteen male\\nsiblings and cousins so counting him and an equal number of daughters, the\\nfirst generation would total 32 children. But since the\\nrapid-population-growth people propose six sons per father or a total of 18\\nsons and 18 daughters, we will test whether even that many children per\\ncouple would produce a sufficient work force to build the tower and city in\\ntime. At the age of 30 Arpachshad would reach adulthood while his youngest\\nsibling would reach adulthood 22 years after that. Thus all of this first\\ngeneration would have reached adulthood 54 years after the Flood (AF)\\n(2+30+22=54 AF). Shem, Ham and Japheth\\'s 36 children would form 18 couples\\nto produce the second generation.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWhen Arpachshad was 35 years old (37 AF) he fathered a son named Shelah who\\nrepresented the second generation. The 18 first generation couples would\\neach bear 12 children for a total of 216 people (108 couples) in the second\\ngeneration. The first person, Shelah, would reach adulthood 67 years AF\\n(2+35+30=67 AF) while his youngest sibling would reach adulthood 22 years\\nlater (67+22=89 AF). So 89 years after the Flood all 216 second generation\\nchildren would reach adulthood and be in the process of bearing twelve\\nchildren per couple to produce the third generation. At this point, 89\\nyears after the Flood, the total adult population of the world would be\\n260-the eight Ark survivors plus 36 first generation and 216 second\\ngeneration folks (8+36+216=260).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nYet according to the faulty age of the earth view, in two more years\\nthousands of workers would have begun constructing Babel and its tower.\\nReally? Not the 216 second generation people. Each of those 108 couples\\nwould have been super busy bearing and caring for their twelve children so\\nit is unlikely they had much time for the construction project. This second\\ngeneration began having children when Shelah fathered Eber in 67 AF.\\nShelah\\'s last sibling reached adulthood 22 years later in 89 AF. For 22\\nyears (67-89 AF) these 108 couples conceived the 1296 children of the third\\ngeneration which reached adulthood between 97 AF and 119 AF. None reached\\nadulthood in time to begin the tower and city in 91 AF so none of them can\\nbe counted among the thousands of required workers.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nPeleg was born in 101 AF, four years after his father Eber reached\\nadulthood in 97 AF. Eber gave his son the name \"Peleg\" (divided) because by\\nthis time some sort of a division had occurred. Only the sixteen couples of\\nthe first generation might have been available for the tower project since\\nthe second generation of 108 couples was busy producing the third\\ngeneration between 67 AF and 97 AF and none of the third generation reached\\nadulthood in time to begin building the tower and city in 91 AF. The\\ndivision Peleg\\'s name referred to must be something other than the division\\nof languages because the needed work force of several thousand beginning\\nten years before he was born did not exist. Whatever was divided by the\\ntime Peleg was born was not the language of those who had built a city and\\na tower because there was no city and tower yet. The thousands of workers\\nneeded to build the city and the tower were yet to reach adulthood or even\\nbe born.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nHowever, the very idea of each male fathering 12 children is both\\ninconsistent with Shem\\'s recorded genealogy and the experience of known\\nScriptural families. Shem, Ham and Japheth fathered sixteen sons, not 18.\\nScripture only reports the number of sons fathered by seven of those\\nsixteen. They had a total of 36 sons, not 42, which is also shy of the six\\nsons per father proposal. Nothing is said of daughters. It could well be\\nthat there were not enough daughters for all sixteen first generation sons\\nto marry. Besides, one or more of the other nine could have met with\\nmisfortune. When space is limited literature generally provides the more\\nstriking than the mundane. In this case the more striking would be the\\nlargest or most important families. Averages cannot be based on the larger\\nfamilies alone.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThen there is the entire issue of the number of reported sons in general.\\nIn the Table of Nations (Genesis 10) 16 are reported for the first\\ngeneration, 36 for the second, two for the third and three for the fourth.\\nBeyond that, Terah had three sons. Abraham was monogamous and had just one\\nson by his life-long partner Sarah, although he had seven by two other\\nwomen. Isaac had just two sons. Jacob had 12 sons by four wives or three\\nsons per mother. He also had only one named daughter, but he had at least\\none unnamed daughter. To provide wives for his sons who could not marry\\ntheir sisters, other families would have to have more daughters than sons.\\nThus, if for instance, he had a total of four daughters, he would have had\\nfour children per wife-three sons and one daughter. This is a far cry from\\n12 children per mother.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSo a more realistic estimate for the first generation is 30 children\\neventually forming 14 couples instead of 36 children forming 18 couples.\\nInstead of 216 second generation people, a more realistic number would be\\n112 people forming 56 couples. Thus, only the 30 first generation people\\nmight have been available to build the city and tower because the second\\ngeneration couples were busy raising the third generation and the third\\ngeneration did not start reaching adulthood until 97 AF.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nFurther, there is the matter of the godly. As they thought about the\\nramifications of not being scattered, they would have dropped out of the\\npotential Babel work force. These would have been the ark survivors and\\nmost of those born in the first generation which leaves only a handful to\\nbuild the city and tower.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIn summary, to complete just the bottom 100 feet of a 200\\' high Tower plus\\na portion of the city, a workforce of several thousand would have to work\\non this project for the ten years before Peleg was born. But thousands of\\nworkers did not even exist in 91 AF even if each couple had six sons and\\nsix daughters. More importantly, Peleg\\'s name refers to a division by\\nwater, not a division by languages. Thus, those who teach that Peleg\\'s name\\nrefers to the Tower of Babel event are snared in two errors.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAll the natural and human activity found in Scripture between the Flood and\\nthe birth of Peleg took more than 101 years. Therefore, Peleg was born more\\nthan 101 years after the Flood and this shows that Shem\\'s genealogy was\\nabbreviated.\\n</p>\\n<br clear=\"all\"/>\\n<p>\\n<strong> </strong>\\n</p>\\n<div>\\n<br clear=\"all\"/>\\n<hr width=\"33%\" size=\"1\" align=\"left\"/>\\n<div id=\"ftn1\">\\n    <p>\\n        <a href=\"#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\" title=\"\">[1]</a>\\nMichael J.

Does the Bible contain errors after all? Eric Lyons of\\nApologetic press may well have put his finger on it when he wrote: \"the\\nsimple fact is, just because one genealogy has more or fewer names than\\nanother genealogy does not mean that the two genealogies contradict one\\nanother.\"<a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\" title=\"\">[1]</a> Appendix Table\\n8.8 contains a full report on his comments which in summary states that\\nHebrew genealogies need not be complete to accomplish the author\\'s purpose.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nToday it is more evident than ever that we must acknowledge the enormous\\ndebt we owe to inerrancy Bible scholars who spend entire lifetimes\\nexamining new evidence that sheds light on manuscripts that seem to\\ndisagree. Guiding their work are the doctrines of inerrancy, transmission\\nand preservation. Their scholarship in the Scriptures combined with these\\nthree doctrines is the subject of this chapter.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nCreation scientists who work hard to find the exact age of the earth have\\nshowcased how creation witnesses in so many ways to the existence of our\\nwise, loving and powerful Creator God. They emphasize inerrancy. But their\\nzeal in some cases is without knowledge. We love them for their\\ncontributions. Yet, we find it necessary to adjure them to appreciate and\\nbe informed by those who are renown in relevant biblical fields in which\\ncreation scientists have not specialized. We also ask them to correct their\\npublished errors in which they condemn these scholars who clearly have\\nright answers.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIt may seem petty to insist that some two millennia passed between the\\nFlood and Aaron, placing the Flood in the time frame of 3600-4300 BC rather\\nthan 2348-2550 BC. But in view of three-and-one-half centuries of\\ndiscoveries since Ussher that have revealed a world of human activity after\\nthe Flood, his 2348 BC date becomes an embarrassing historical error. This\\nmeans those in the creation movement who proclaim his time frame place a\\nstigma of naivety and ignorance on the entire creation movement so it is\\ndismissed as hopelessly uninformed. As a result, the work of creation\\nscientists is mostly disregarded by the secular world.\\n</p>\\n<h3>\\nIdentifying True Genealogical Authorities\\n</h3>\\n<p>\\nThe leading source that advanced genealogies over other Scripture was James\\nUssher (1581-1656), Anglican Archbishop of Ireland from 1625 until his\\ndeath. Ussher was a scholar and prolific writer for the faith. Of all his\\nworks, he is most remembered for <em>The Annuls of the World</em>, a\\nclassic survey of world history. <em>Annals</em>, written in Latin,\\nappeared just six years before his death. Two years after he died its\\nEnglish translation appeared; in 2003 a modern English translation was\\nreleased.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIn <em>Annals</em> Ussher advanced the idea that scriptural genealogies\\nwere complete and from their numbers the age of the earth (and universe)\\ncould be determined precisely. He found the date of creation to be the\\nevening of October 23, 4004 BC, or in round numbers about 4000 years before\\nthe birth of Christ. He dated the Flood at 2348 BC. Young earth\\ncreationists frequently cite Ussher for their conviction that the age of\\nthe earth can be known within a few years.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nUssher\\'s scholarship and piety are indisputable. His world was learning,\\nlanguages, books and writing. In diplomacy he managed to walk a narrow path\\nbetween supporting the English monarchy while not offending the\\nfreedom-seeking Parliament, even asking their permission to move to\\nEngland. He is said to have watched the execution of Charles I, but fainted\\nbefore the ax fell. In spite of Ussher\\'s strong support for the throne,\\nOliver Cromwell who led Parliament in opposing the unlimited power of the\\ncrown insisted that he have an elaborate state funeral and be buried at\\nWestminster Abbey. Such was the esteem for his character.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBut Ussher labored under enormous handicaps. For instance, the contribution\\nof archaeology to ancient history was still several centuries away. The\\ngreat ancient manuscript discoveries were yet to be made. Hieroglyphics and\\ncuneiform would not be deciphered for another 200 years. Scholars were far\\nmore limited in their access to rare books for primary research. While\\nscribes came to take great care in copying Scripture by the eighth century\\nAD, they passed on the mistakes of earlier scribes. Since the venerable\\nBishop, those who serve God by laboring to determine precisely every letter\\nor mark of the original Old Testament Hebrew text have made many textual\\nimprovements even though their work will never be completed.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe field that deals with textual accuracy lies within the general area of\\n\"Semitics and Old Testament Studies.\" Experts in it have mastered not only\\nthe original language of the Old Testament but also related Semitic\\nlanguages and often spend a lifetime studying, writing about and teaching\\nthe fruit of this discipline. In addition, they have learned the broad\\nfields of biblical archaeology and ancient Near East history and for those\\nof faith, they pretty much know the Scriptures backwards and forwards.\\nInvariably, these individuals have brilliant minds and are the top\\nstudents. These are the authorities conservative evangelicals can trust to\\nprovide sound interpretations to the genealogical lists of the OT.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Dr. Merrill F. Unger </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAmong such modern scholars are Merrill F. Unger and Eugene H. Merrill.\\nUnger, 1909-1980, maintained an amazing straight A record in all his course\\nwork at Dallas Theological Seminary leading to Master of Theology and\\nDoctor of Theology degrees (possibly the only DTS student ever to do so).\\nThe Master of Theology degree is a professional degree representing four\\nyears of course work beyond an acceptable college degree. Unger earned his\\nA.B. and Ph.D. degrees from world renowned Johns Hopkins University in his\\nhome town of Baltimore Maryland. His Ph.D. was in Semitics and Old\\nTestament Studies. He grew thriving churches, was a popular conference\\nspeaker, chaired the Department of Old Testament during his entire 19-year\\ntenure at Dallas Theological Seminary, taught Hebrew for years and wrote 26\\nbooks. When he retired in 1967 the school made him Distinguished Professor\\nEmeritus of Old Testament for life. Such was the esteem in which he was\\nheld.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nEugene H. Merrill (1934-Present) represents the next generation in the\\nUnger tradition. He earned two Ph.D. degrees, first at his B.A. and M.A.\\nalma mater, Bob Jones University and the second in Middle Eastern Studies\\nat Columbia University. He earned three masters degrees including one at\\nColumbia University in the field of his doctoral degree and one at New York\\nUniversity in Jewish Studies. He taught in the Old Testament Department at\\nDallas Theological Seminary, one of the world\\'s largest Evangelical\\nseminaries, for over 35 years and upon retirement in 2013 was named\\nDistinguished Professor Emeritus of Old Testament Studies. He has written\\nten books and some 200 articles, mainly of a historical and exegetical\\nnature. He is an active churchman and preaches and teaches abroad on a\\nregular basis.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBut who promotes Ussher\\'s view on the age of the earth today? Certainly not\\nUnger or Merrill! These scholars find Ussher\\'s view of a short Egyptian\\nsojourn and his opinion that the genealogies were comprehensive to be\\ncontrary to both Scripture and the history of the ancient Near East. Dr.\\nUnger felt so strongly about this error that he addressed it in\\nconsiderable detail under the entry \"Genealogy\" of    <em>Unger\\'s Bible Dictionary</em>, and, the <em>Dictionary</em> itself,\\nwhich as explained earlier, represented the work of many Bible scholars\\nover an entire century. It expresses the standard thinking of conservative\\nevangelical biblical scholars. The following is an excerpt from his\\narticle:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    B. B. Warfield showed more than a generation ago that the Bible\\n    genealogies contained gaps (\"The Antiquity and Unity of the Human\\n    Race,\" <em>Studies in Theology</em>, New York, 1932, pp. 235-258). The\\n    genealogies in Exod. 6:16-24, Ezra 7:1-5 and Matt. 1:1-17 contain\\n    omissions. This is most certainly the case also in the genealogical\\n    lists in Genesis 5 and 11. To use these genealogical lists in Genesis\\n    to calculate the creation of man (c. 4004 B.C.), as Archbishop Ussher\\n    has done, is not only unwarranted from a comparative study of\\n    Scriptural genealogies, but incontestably disproved by the\\n    well-attested facts of modern archaeology. The total length of the\\n    period from the creation of man to the flood and from the flood to\\n    Abraham is not specified in Scripture. That the genealogies of Gen. 5\\n    and 11 are most assuredly drastically abbreviated and have names that\\n    are highly selective is suggested by the fact that each list contains\\n    only ten names, ten from Adam to Noah and ten from Shem to Abraham. It\\n    is quite evident that symmetry was the goal in constructing these\\n    genealogical lists rather than a setting forth of unbroken descent from\\n    father to son, in contrast to modern registers of pedigree. Such\\n    symmetry with the omission of certain names is obvious from the\\n    genealogy of Matt. 1:1-17. This fact is further corroborated by the\\n    evident latitude used in ancient Semitic languages in the expressions\\n    \"begat,\" \"bear,\" \"father,\" and \"son.\" This usage is completely contrary\\n    to English idiom. Thus to \"beget\" a \"son\" may mean to beget an actual\\n    child or a grandchild or a great grandchild or even distant\\n    descendants. Usage extends to tribes or countries (Gen. 10:2-22), and\\n    even to non-blood relationship. Jehu, the usurper and founder of a new\\n    dynasty in Israel and with no blood connection whatsoever to the House\\n    of Omri, is nevertheless called \"son of Omri\" by Shalmaneser III of\\nAssyria. (Daniel David Luckenbill,        <em>Ancient Records of Assyria and Babylonia I</em>, Sect. 590.)\\n    Nebuchadnezzar is called the \"father\" of Belshazzar who was actually\\n    the son of Nabonidus, a usurper (Dan. 5:2). Accordingly, as J. H. Raven\\n    says in the regular recurring formula, \"A lived . . . years and begat\\n    B, and A lived after he begat B . . . years and begat sons and\\n    daughters, and B lived . . . years and begat C,\" B may not be the\\n    literal son of A but a distant descendant. If so, the age of A is his\\n    age at the birth of the child from whom B is descended. Between A and\\n    B, accordingly, many centuries may intervene. The Genesis genealogical\\n    lists are not intended to divulge the antiquity of man upon the earth,\\n    but to set forth in outstanding representative names the line of the\\n    promised Redeemer (Gen. 3:15) from Adam to Abraham and to show the\\n    effects of sin and the altered conditions brought about by the flood\\n    and upon human vitality and longevity. Added evidence that the\\n    genealogies of Gen. 5 and 11 contain extensive breaks is demonstrated\\n    by the fact that they allow only about 4000 years from the creation of\\n    Adam to Christ. On the other hand, modern archaeology clearly traces\\n    sedimentary pottery cultures such as that from Tell Halaf well before\\n    4000 B. C. To place the flood so late as 2348 B. C. as is the case if\\n    the genealogies are employed for chronological purposes, is\\n    archaeologically fantastic. This great cataclysm certainly took place\\n    long before 4000 B. C. Revised by M.F.U.\\n</strong>\\n<a href=\"#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\" title=\"\"><strong>[2]</strong></a>\\n<strong> </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBefore discovering this section by Unger this author had determined to\\nrestrict his research to the study of Scripture itself, particularly those\\npassages of possible abbreviated genealogies suggested by conservative\\nauthorities and further passages those passages led to, rather than\\nScripture plus secular disciplines such as archaeology and ancient Near\\nEast history. This approach yielded numerous examples of abbreviated\\ngenealogies. This was done with the background of a seminary degree, a\\nlifetime of study in the Scriptures and average academic ability.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nMoreover, while many creation science authors have spent a proportionate\\namount of study in some field of science, they lack such ancient Near East\\ntraining. It seems appropriate to ask them to defer to inerrancy experts\\nwith extensive scriptural training and not to berate them when they reject\\nUssher\\'s view. While those more theologically trained and those more\\nscientifically trained both believe in inerrancy, the latter show\\nthemselves to be weak in their knowledge of biblical expertise when they\\nbecome inappropriately dogmatic in their biblical viewpoint. Further, this\\nrides against the principal of Ephesians 4:2-3 to maintain \"the unity of\\nthe Spirit in the bond of peace.\"\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Dr. Eugene H. Merrill </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe following pages particularize what it takes to be an expert in the\\nfields of manuscript study with its many nuances of textual understanding\\nand interpretation. Dr. Eugene H. Merrill is used to represent the next\\ngeneration of scholars in the Unger tradition. He devotes many pages in\\nsupport of the generally accepted dates among conservative evangelical\\nscholars such as the following statements concerning the time in Egypt:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nI Kings 6:1&#8230;informs us that Solomon began to build his temple in his\\nfourth year (967/966) which was also the 480<sup>th</sup> year after the\\nExodus. This places the date of the Exodus at 1446 B.C. In Exodus 12:40 we\\nlearn that Israel was in Egypt 430-years&#8230;\"    <a href=\"#_ftn3\" name=\"_ftnref3\" title=\"\"><strong>[3]</strong></a>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nToday most young earth creation leaders who speak on the subject still\\nadvocate Ussher\\'s methodology and dates. They turn a deaf ear to three and\\na half centuries of manuscript discovery and textual refinements. Worst of\\nall they possess none of the qualifications of true scholars such as Unger\\nand Merrill for determining the truth of matters in these fields, yet they\\nwrite entire books to perpetuate their errors. Undiscerning creation\\nscientists are taken in by their pseudo knowledge and authority claims and\\nperpetuate their errors. One of these current so-called authorities uses\\n7000 words to argue that Israel sojourned in Egypt just 215-years while\\nMoses needed only 12 words to write \"the time the people of Israel lived in\\nEgypt was 430-years\" (Exodus 12:40). Surprisingly many creationists take\\nthis man\\'s words over those of Moses. \"This is not good,\" you say. Most\\nwould agree. Those in the creation movement need to learn from genuine\\nconservative evangelical scholars instead of those who multiply arguments\\nto perpetuate the errors of the past.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Another Uninformed Response: The Two Cainans</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAppendix 8.8 addresses the problem of the two Cainans in Luke three. It\\nreports how a leading creation apologist answered this problem by using\\nmaterial up to two centuries old. The Dead Sea Scrolls which have only\\nrecently been available falsify that two-century-old material. Sadly, that\\ncreation scientist is using his fine mind to perpetuate the Ussher error\\nrather than to carefully examine the work of today\\'s true inerrancy OT\\nscholars. God protects the Body of Christ through these scholars whose\\nlives are devoted to the fields that address the Old Testament text.\\nDeferring to their learning will save much confusion and misinformation.\\n</p>\\n<h3>\\nInerrancy Confused with Preservation and Transmission\\n</h3>\\n<p>\\nSome Ussher supporters back their chronology by appealing to a faulty view\\nof the preservation of Scripture. They declare that God has promised to\\npreserve the actual text of Scripture, the actual words of God including\\nevery original jot and tittle (Matthew 5:17). Some even maintain that only\\none Hebrew OT text and one Greek NT text contain the Scripture free of\\nerror. Compounding this error, some go so far as to believe that the King\\nJames Version is a divinely inspired translation and the only true Word of\\nGod in the English language.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nNeither Matthew 5:17 nor its context says or implies that the written text\\nof Scripture will be preserved without error in any one manuscript. What it\\ndoes say is that God will fulfill all that the Law and the Prophets have\\nsaid. When this is pointed out they jump to various other verses such as\\nRomans 3:2, Mark 13:31, Jeremiah 1:12, Isaiah 40:8 and Psalm 12:6-7. But\\nnone of these verses support their view either. Rather, they promise that\\nGod will do what He has said and that what He said is true and lasting.\\nConsequently, their view is both unbiblical and, in effect, trumps EVERY\\nmanuscript find and textual refinement. It says textual scholars are\\nunneeded and archaeologists should disregard any biblical texts they\\nunearth.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThis overemphasis on preservation is actually an attack on the word and\\ncharacter of God-God didn\\'t say that and if He had, He would be guilty of\\nerror. Yet everything God says is true-His word and His character remain\\nunstained. This view confuses preservation with inerrancy. While inerrancy\\nis held by all conservative evangelicals, this view of preservation is held\\nby only a handful of advocates and the many thousands they have misled with\\ntheir rhetoric. So what are the true doctrines of inerrancy, preservation\\nand transmission?\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nTheologians use three words to speak of the fact that Scripture is without\\nerror-infallibility, inspiration and inerrancy. They apply only to the\\noriginal writings. \"Infallibility\" means \"without error\" and is becoming\\nthe least used of these three words. \"Inspiration\" comes from II Timothy\\n3:16 and begins Dallas Theological Seminary\\'s Statement of Faith. It has to\\ndo with the method God used to give the Bible:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWe believe that \"all Scripture is given by inspiration of God,\" [II Timothy\\n3:16] by which we understand the whole Bible is inspired in the sense that\\nholy men of God \"were moved by the Holy Spirit\" to write the very words of\\nScripture. We believe that this divine inspiration extends equally and\\nfully to all parts of the writings-historical, poetical, doctrinal, and\\nprophetical-as appeared in the original manuscripts.

We further affirm that copies and\\ntranslations of Scripture are the Word of God to the extent that they\\nfaithfully represent the original.\"    <a href=\"#_ftn6\" name=\"_ftnref6\" title=\"\">[6]</a>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nLeading conservative theologians regard the Chicago Statement as a very\\nthorough statement of what \"inerrancy\" involves. The statement elaborates\\non various details in Articles formed as couplets of \"We affirm &#8230; We\\ndeny &#8230;.\" Also in this Statement, inerrancy applies only to the    <em>original manuscripts </em>(which no longer exist, but can be inferred\\non the basis of extant copies), not to the copies or translations\\nthemselves. Further, inerrancy does <em>not </em>mean blind literalism, but\\nallows for figurative, poetic and phenomenological language, as long as it\\nis <em>accurate</em>. Nor does the Statement define the precise set of\\nbiblical books to be considered \"Scripture.\"\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nDallas Seminary graduate and Bible teacher Hampton Keathley defined\\n\"Inerrancy\" as\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n...a term used to explain that the Bible is completely true and contains no\\nerrors in the original autographs. The reason inerrancy is an issue is\\nbecause some religious \"scholars\" believe that the scripture contains\\nerrors, yet they continue to claim to believe in \"inspiration.\" Actually,\\nthey\\'re trying to redefine \"inspiration\" to include possible errors.\\nTherefore, it is necessary to discuss \"inerrancy\" because it assures that\\nwe understand inspiration to mean \"without error.\"    <a href=\"#_ftn7\" name=\"_ftnref7\" title=\"\"><strong>[7]</strong></a>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIn the same place Keathley summarizes that \"[Inerrancy means] freedom from\\nerror or untruths. Synonyms include \\'certainty, assuredness, objective\\ncertainty, infallibility.\\'\"\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThus, an accurate description about the truthfulness of Scripture is that\\nits authors were guided or inspired by the Holy Spirit so that without\\nwaving their personalities or cultures, they were able to pen what God\\nwanted written without error. It only applies to the very document that\\nauthor composed.\\n</p>\\n<h3>\\nThe Ongoing Process of Preservation and Transmission\\n</h3>\\n<p>\\nIn contrast to the doctrine of infallibility/inspiration/inerrancy which\\nrelates to the original writings, the activities of preservation and\\ntransmission spread God\\'s revelation in every generation to the entire\\nworld with sufficient integrity that man can come to know Him and do His\\nwill. The Chicago Conference put it this way: \"we deny that any essential\\nelement of the Christian faith is affected by the absence of the\\nautographs. We further deny that this absence renders the assertion of\\nBiblical inerrancy invalid or irrelevant.\"    <a href=\"#_ftn8\" name=\"_ftnref8\" title=\"\">[8]</a>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe idea of preservation focuses on the quality of the Scriptures available\\ntoday. How true are they to the originals? The answer comes from several\\ndirections. One is reliability. Copies of many ancient manuscripts have\\ncome down to the present. Like the Scriptures their originals have also\\nbeen lost. Like the Scriptures, scholars have collected copies of them and\\ncompared the copies to determine how much change has crept in. In doing so\\nthe world of scholarship has come to realize that there are vastly more\\ncopies of ancient scriptural texts than nearly all other ancient works.\\nThrough comparing these texts scholars have learned just how carefully the\\nScriptures have been preserved. Thus, this preservation is an astonishing\\ntestimony to the divine hand behind it. It far exceeds other ancient books\\nin trueness to the original writings. The general conclusion is that\\nScripture has been preserved vastly beyond most other works.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nCertainly, God the Holy Spirit moved the followers of Christ to put forth\\nthe massive effort required to produce so many copies of Scripture that\\nsurvive from antiquity. The facts regarding this massive body of texts is\\nfeatured on the website maintained by Josh McDowell Ministries.    <a href=\"#_ftn9\" name=\"_ftnref9\" title=\"\">[9]</a> Thus, it is no\\nexaggeration to say that no other ancient text begins to compare with the\\nreliability of Scripture. In this way God has preserved His Word.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAnother way in which God has preserved His revelation to mankind is by its\\nrepetition. God led different authors to state the same truths so that if\\nthe truth was obscured or even lost in one or two places, it would be\\ncorrectly preserved in other portions of Scripture. By stating every major\\ndoctrine again and again in different places and in different ways, man is\\nnot without a clear understanding of any major doctrine of Scripture.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe work of God in preserving Scripture and the work of man in transmitting\\nScripture can be likened to a partnership. As the various books of the\\nBible were penned, others would want the writing, so copies were prepared.\\nCopies wore out, so new copies were made. Over time Scripture was\\ntranslated into the primary languages of people world-wide. All this\\ncopying and translating was a matter of transmission. Transmission was (and\\nis) man\\'s part who hopefully is looking to the Holy Spirit for enablement.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAs we study this partnership, we realize God did not promise to preserve\\nthe Scriptures without error as they were transmitted through history. In\\nall, about 1% of the text was subject to question at the time of the rise\\nof intense textual studies two centuries ago. In fact scholars have\\ncompiled a considerable list of errors found in any text, whether it be the\\nMasoretic Text tradition or the ancient manuscript finds or the Septuagint.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIn recent years with a vast number of manuscripts to make comparisons,\\ntextual scholars have never been busier. For example, they can now compare\\nthe Dead Sea Scrolls with the current MT and LXX. When there is a\\ndifference, they must debate which spelling, which form of a word or even\\nwhich word is the correct reading. Sometimes the Hebrew MT is the preferred\\nchoice. Sometimes the Greek LXX reading is selected. Sometimes a third or\\nfourth textual family is preferred. In this way God has made His people\\n(all believers) partners with Him in the integrity of Scripture so we would\\ncontinue to strive for the best possible rendering of the autographs.\\nAgain, in this partnership God does the necessary preserving while man does\\nthe transmitting. Only preserving must not be equated with inerrancy. This\\nmay be a difficult truth for some to grasp but it does have a practical\\napplication. Maybe this is another way our Father is trying to tell us He\\ndoesn\\'t want us to strain over the exact age of the earth for He Himself\\nhas not stated it. It is enough that we know the earth (and the universe)\\nis exceedingly young, probably only 7000-9000 years old.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nFar more basic is the authority of Scripture. It is the key issue for the\\nChristian church in this and every age. Thus, various dangers must be\\navoided. The most obvious is denying the divine origin of Scripture\\naltogether which is an expression of unbelief and a rejection of God. But\\npeople of faith can also err in many ways concerning Scripture. The one\\naddressed in these paragraphs is to exaggerate the doctrine of preservation\\nand minimize the work of transmission. A proper balance between these two\\nconcepts must be found just as a proper balance between the sovereignty of\\nGod and the accountability of man must be found. Happily, the informed\\nChristian will avoid an overemphasis on the preservation of Scripture. For\\neven though we do not have those original autographs, the Scriptures are\\ntrustworthy and totally sufficient to unite the one who receives them with\\nthe God who gave them.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSomeone may object, saying that the scribes had a strict procedure for\\ncopying. It is true that beginning about 500 AD an extended family of\\nscribes called Masoretes living in the vicinity of Tiberias Israel began to\\ndevelop procedures to guard against copying mistakes. Over the centuries\\nother scribes adopted these procedures and by about 800 AD they were pretty\\nmuch the standard. But that was 1000 years after the LXX and 1200 years\\nafter the writing of the last Old Testament book. In that millennium many\\ncopying errors crept into the various texts. While most of them are mere\\nmatters of spelling, some are matters of the text itself like the erroneous\\ntext of Exodus 12:40 in the MT (see chapter 2B, The Witness of Moses.)\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nGetting the distinction between the doctrines of inerrancy and preservation\\nright is essential in honoring the integrity of God. As creationists\\ndeclare the primary evidence for God, of all Christians they need to make\\nsure they understand and teach this distinction lest they defeat their very\\nobjective.\\n</p>\\n<br clear=\"all\"/>\\n<div>\\n<br clear=\"all\"/>\\n<hr width=\"33%\" size=\"1\" align=\"left\"/>\\n<div id=\"ftn1\">\\n    <p>\\n        <a href=\"#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\" title=\"\">\\n            <sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup>\\n        </a>\\n        Lyons, \"Was Cainan the Son of Arphaxad?\"\\n    </p>\\n</div>\\n<div id=\"ftn2\">\\n    <p>\\n        <a href=\"#_ftnref2\" name=\"_ftn2\" title=\"\">\\n            <sup><sup>[2]</sup></sup>\\n        </a>\\n        Unger, <em>Dictionary</em>, 396.\\n    </p>\\n</div>\\n<div id=\"ftn3\">\\n    <p>\\n        <a href=\"#_ftnref3\" name=\"_ftn3\" title=\"\">\\n            <sup><sup>[3]</sup></sup>\\n        </a>\\nEugene H Merrill,            <em>An Historical Survey of the Old Testament</em>, (Nutley, NJ:\\n        The Craig Press, 1966), 98.\\n    </p>\\n</div>\\n<div id=\"ftn4\">\\n    <p>\\n        <a href=\"#_ftnref4\" name=\"_ftn4\" title=\"\">\\n            <sup><sup>[4]</sup></sup>\\n        </a>\\n        <sup> </sup>\\nDallas Theological Seminary, \"Doctrinal Statement,            <strong> </strong>Article I-The Scriptures,\" (Dallas, TX: Dallas\\n        Theological Seminary).\\n        https://www.dts.edu/about/doctrinalstatement/\\n    </p>\\n</div>\\n<div id=\"ftn5\">\\n    <p>\\n        <a href=\"#_ftnref5\" name=\"_ftn5\" title=\"\">\\n            <sup><sup>[5]</sup></sup>\\n        </a>\\n        <sup> </sup>\\n        Charles C.

In the last century several\\nmillion Ancient Near East (ANE) written records have been discovered by\\narchaeologists. None of course were available to Ussher.

The discovery of these documents is\\nincluded to show how well-established secular history agrees with what\\nScripture itself reveals and how without them Scripture might seem to\\ncontain many tall tales.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n\"I remember it well,\" wrote archaeologist Allan Millard.    <a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\" title=\"\">[1]</a> Millard was referring to\\npossibly the most astonishing archaeological discovery ever to confirm the\\nbiblical findings of this book and shout down 2348 BC. In early October\\n1975 the Syrian Director of Antiquities visited Millard\\'s dig site with\\nastonishing news: Italian archaeologists digging at Tell Mardikh (Ebla),\\nfarther north, had found 16,000 cuneiform tablets written between 2400 and\\n2250 BC! The tablets provided many important insights into the historical,\\ncultural, economic and political life in northern Mesopotamia around the\\nmiddle of the 3rd millennium BC (2600-2250 BC). They included a broad range\\nof state-oriented literature-from records of state revenue and diplomatic\\nexchanges with foreign rulers to school texts, dictionaries, hymns and\\npopular legends.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nToday a more precise inventory of the Eblaite palace tablets reports that\\nas many as 1,800 complete clay tablets, 4,700 fragments and many thousands\\nof minor chips were found. Most were produced in the forty or so years\\nbefore 2250 BC when Ebla was invaded and the palace burned, preserving the\\ntablets. While the Ebla documents are outstanding because of their early\\ndate, they are but the tip of the iceberg. Cuneiform script was invented in\\nSouthern Mesopotamia\\'s Sumer about 3000 BC and continued to be used until\\nnear the time of Christ. As other civilizations arose in the region, each\\nadopted this script to its own language. An estimated one-half to two\\nmillion cuneiform texts have been discovered just in this area. The British\\nMuseum alone contains approximately 130,000 texts and fragments. Subject\\nmatter covers most of the matters of life, all the way from beer recipes to\\nlaw codes to mythology to mathematics. Together they document beyond\\nquestion that civilizations flourished centuries before Ussher\\'s Flood\\ndate.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nMillard wrote that archaeologists in Syria might dream of finding a few\\ndozen tablets, or even a couple of hundred. At the famous site of Ugarit, a\\nfew thousand cuneiform tablets had been dug up over many seasons. Only at\\nMari, far down the Euphrates, had an Ebla-sized hoard been\\ndiscovered-between 20,000 and 30,000; they were found in a palace dating to\\nabout 1800 B.C. Putting the Ebla discovery in perspective he said that if\\nfinding a few dozen cuneiform tablets was an archaeologist\\'s dream, finding\\n16,000 might well be an archaeologist\\'s nightmare! The studying and\\npublishing of a collection of texts of that size would be a gargantuan\\ntask. \"The texts from Mari, discovered since 1933 are still not fully\\npublished.\"<a href=\"#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\" title=\"\">[2]</a>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Preservation of the Ebla tablets </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe Ebla site is located about 35 miles SW of the modern city of Aleppo\\nSyria and is called Tell Mardikh after the nearby village of Mardikh. Ebla\\nwas a major trade center and had long been known to archaeologists from\\nancient writings found in other greater Mesopotamian cities. In 1968 it was\\npositively identified when archaeologists at the site recovered a statue\\ndedicated to the goddess Ishtar. It bore the name of Ibbit-Lim, identifying\\nhim as king of Ebla. More levels were uncovered in the following years. The\\nunprecedented palace find was made in the summer of 1975, just 47 years\\nago.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nTime is the enemy of ancient written records. Usually, they eventually\\nsuccumb to the elements. But an accident of history preserved the Ebla\\ntablets. When invaders burned the palace, the heat baked the tablets,\\npreserving them in what the archaeologists call the Central Archive Room, a\\n12\\' by 17\\' room beside the king\\'s Audience Hall. Immediately south along\\nthe same wall a passage led to the Administrative Quarter where the king\\nusually fulfilled his administrative duties. Alfredo Archi writes that\\nsimilar layouts were found in the royal palaces of Mari and Ugarit. He\\nconcludes that the Central Archive Room was of major importance to the\\nsuccessful governing of the kingdom.    <a href=\"#_ftn3\" name=\"_ftnref3\" title=\"\">[3]</a>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nA standard archive tablet measured 9x12 inches. These larger tablets were\\narranged on shelves, classified by subject like a modern library and were\\nfound where they had fallen onto the floor over four millennia earlier.\\nSome even had a title on the edge. Smaller rooms contained specific types\\nof records. \"The most southern two rooms of the Administrative Quarter (L.\\n2982, L. 2984) were reachable only from the Throne-room through a sole\\nnarrow entrance, and were protected by thick walls. They might have been\\nthe rooms of the treasurer&#8230;where the precious metals were stored. One\\ntablet found there, TM.82.G.266, is an account of large numbers of fields,\\ncattle, and sheep, and large amounts of silver and gold, whose more\\ndetailed data could have been obtained from documents of the Central\\nArchive.\"<a href=\"#_ftn4\" name=\"_ftnref4\" title=\"\">[4]</a> Other rooms\\ncontained daily records which were periodically summarized on the\\nstandardized tablets placed in the Central Archive.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe tablets themselves found in these eight to ten locations all close to\\nthe Audience Room, the Throne Room and the Administrative Quarter were\\npalace records. They contained not only government and economic documents\\nbut also literary texts such as myths, epic narratives, hymns, rituals,\\ngazetteers and even school-related materials. Since they included\\ndictionaries, copybooks and students scratch pads, some have concluded that\\nEbla was a major educational center for the training of scribes.    <a href=\"#_ftn5\" name=\"_ftnref5\" title=\"\">[5]</a>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Development of Writing/Deciphering the Ebla Tablets</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThough cuneiform had been deciphered a century before, linguists\\nexperienced much frustration as they attempted to read the Ebla tablets. An\\nexplanation of the development of writing and especially cuneiform explains\\nwhy. Sumerians in Southern Mesopotamia began developing cuneiform writing\\nlate in the fourth millennium BC. Because of the constant interchange of\\nMesopotamian merchants and traders with Egypt, the Egyptians soon began\\ndeveloping their own writing system called hieroglyphics. Writing systems\\nin other parts of the world developed much later.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe Sumerian tablets were made of dampened clay. The scribe used a stylus\\nto make wedge-shaped marks on them. \"Cuneiform\" actually means\\n\"wedge-shaped.\" Because of the complicated combinations of the thousand or\\nso signs, only a few people beyond scribes were able to read the tablets.\\nThe Egyptians wrote their hieroglyphics mostly on a paper-like substance\\ncalled papyrus which eventually turns brittle under very dry conditions and\\nmoldy under humid conditions.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe two writing systems took different directions. Both began as picture\\nwriting. Over time cuneiform symbols evolved to words and finally to sounds\\nwhile hieroglyphs remained recognizable pictures throughout its 3500-year\\nhistory. Also, over time the 1000 cuneiform pictures were standardized and\\nreduced in number across the region as they came to represent sounds but\\nthe symbols still numbered in the hundreds. As each major Near East\\ncivilization near the Mesopotamian population bowl developed, it adapted\\nthe cuneiform script to express its own language-Sumerian, Akkadian,\\nHittite, Eblaite, Persian, Ugaritic, Elamite, Babylonian and Hurrian. In\\neffect cuneiform was the alphabet of the region.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nFor a modern scholar to read even a single Mesopotamian tablet he first had\\nto learn cuneiform with all its different forms through two and a half\\nmillennia of change which was a herculean task in itself and then the\\nspecific language he was working with. Eventually the much shorter\\nPhoenician alphabet began replacing cuneiform symbols and by 100 BC all\\nlanguages written with cuneiform script had abandoned it.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nTwo languages appeared on the Ebla tablets: Sumerian, which the linguists\\nknew and an unknown language which turned out to be the language spoken in\\nthe Kingdom of Ebla. But with Ebla\\'s use of cuneiform the problem got even\\nworse. While the Sumerian scribes were developing a writing system that\\nemployed a growing mixture of logograms (a symbol that represents a whole\\nword) and phonetic signs, the Eblaite scribes were way ahead. By the time\\nEbla fell about 2250 B.C., its scribes had reduced the number of signs to\\nan entirely phonetic system. So the tablets contained a mix of Sumerian,\\nolder Eblaite and a newer Eblaite using only phonetic signs.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe development of signs representing sounds was a momentous advance in the\\nhistory of writing. This newest form of Eblaite was both the earliest\\nexample of transcription (rendering sounds in a system invented for another\\nlanguage) and a major simplifying step towards \"reader friendliness\" that\\nwould enable a wider spread of literacy in palace, temple and merchant\\ncontexts.<a href=\"#_ftn6\" name=\"_ftnref6\" title=\"\">[6]</a>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nNow it is obvious why the archaeologists had such difficulty accurately\\ntranslating the Ebla tablets. About 80% of the tablets were written using\\nthe usual Sumerian combination of logograms and phonetic signs in both the\\nknown language of Sumer and the unknown language of Ebla. But the other 20%\\nexhibited the innovative, purely phonetic representation of cuneiform in\\nthis unknown Semitic language. Further, symbols representing this new\\nsystem must have begun slipping into some of the 80% which used the older\\nforms, further tripping up the linguists. Unaware of all this, early\\ntranslation efforts resulted is some of the most sensational claims and\\nblatant errors of all times in the history of archaeology.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe name of the Hebrew god and all kinds of biblical place names were found\\nin the Ebla tablets-Jerusalem, Gaza, even Sodom and Gomorrah. Over many\\nyears bilingual Sumerian/Eblaite vocabulary lists were found among the\\ntablets, allowing the better translation of Eblaite. Eventually the fine\\nnuances of Eblaite were mastered, the mistakes corrected and now more\\naccurate information from the tablets is available. Those remarkable claims\\nsuch as finding the name of the Hebrew god and biblical place names were\\ntranslation errors and have been withdrawn.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Subject matter and date of the Ebla documents</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIn the beginning writing was used primarily for unsophisticated record\\nkeeping. Transactions, inventories, and government regulations needed to be\\nrecorded. Early libraries began as warehouses for government and religious\\nrecords. As the library\\'s function expanded, a growing number of scribes\\nwas needed. Often they were housed in or near the library. Collections\\nexpanded beyond recordkeeping to include information related to math,\\nscience, agriculture, and theology.    <a href=\"#_ftn7\" name=\"_ftnref7\" title=\"\">[7]</a> Ebla was no different.\\nBesides business records, royal letters and diplomatic documents, were\\naccounts of Ebla\\'s rich history dating back to 3000 BC in the Upper Levant.\\nIt had trade agreements with numerous other city-states through the\\ncenturies. Similar records at Mari and Ur spoke of relations with Ebla. At\\none point Ebla controlled the trade route all the way from the\\nMediterranean to the Persian Gulf. At other times it controlled trade from\\nthe Mediterranean to a point partway down the Euphrates and at still other\\ntimes was subject to other kingdoms.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nFast forward to the final 40 or so years of the Ebla tablets: the process\\nof record keeping had become extremely efficient. As previously stated,\\nrecords of daily transactions were kept in specialized areas. Then\\naccording to various schedules, they would be summarized on a standardized\\ntablet which was permanently stored in the Archive Room and the temporary\\ntablet was discarded. One tablet might contain all the transactions of a\\ncertain nature for a year. Some business records contained many columns.\\nAbout 5000 place names were found in the tablets. Some were noted cities in\\nGreater Mesopotamia, but most were towns, villages, hamlets or large\\nestates that helped identify the parties to the transaction.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe archive tablets were dated in various ways, sometimes by the king\\'s\\nname and year of ascension; at other times by his chief minister and year.\\nThe tablets we speak of bear the names of just five succeeding kings or\\ntheir officials which allowed the archaeologists to date them to the years\\nbetween 2400 and 2250 BC. The names of some of these five kings have been\\nfound on king lists for Ebla in other cities of Mesopotamia.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThrough much of Ebla\\'s history, its chief rival was Mari, the kingdom on\\nthe Euphrates midway between Ebla and the Gulf. The first Ebla king during\\nthe archive period was king Igrish-Halam. Payment of tribute to Mari and\\nthe extensive invasion of Eblate cities by the Mariot king Iblul-ll marked\\nhis reign as they drained Ebla\\'s resources. Under the next king,\\nIrkab-Damu, Ebla\\'s army succeeded in driving Mari back. This was around\\n2340 BC. From this point Ebla began to prosper. By the time of the\\ndestruction Ebla had developed the highly efficient record system explained\\nabove and was beginning to use the newly invented all-phonetic system as\\nwell. This growing prosperity and government efficiency are mostly\\nreflected in Central Archive tablets dating to 2300 BC or later.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nDocuments obviously do not reflect events that occurred after they were\\nwritten but may reflect not only the times in which they were written but\\nearlier times as well. Ebla\\'s tablets include a massive number of business\\nrecords of the kingdom, giving a powerful picture of its recent economic\\nactivity. But the tablets were something of a library as well. Alfonso\\nArchi\\'s huge 854-page tome covers the detail found in them. He writes\\n\"While Mesopotamian royal inscriptions limit themselves to simply\\nmentioning the principal warlike undertakings of the kings, without\\nproviding any chronological framework, thanks to the administrative\\ndocuments from Ebla we now know of each of the successive military\\nexpeditions carried out year after year over a period of forty years\\n(2290-2250 BC). These expeditions were all concluded within a year by an\\nexchange of messengers, oaths of peace, and other agreements often broken\\nafter a few years.\"<a href=\"#_ftn8\" name=\"_ftnref8\" title=\"\">[8]</a>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nEbla with its allies had soundly defeated its great rival down the\\nEuphrates some 75 years before. Now as 2250 BC approached tablets reveal\\ngrowing desperate measures to stave off the obviously increasing danger\\nfrom Mari. Mari was regaining its battlefield power in the face of Eblaite\\nforces. Among the Eblaite allies royal weddings cemented relations with\\nneighboring states. Generous treaties bought friendship with other\\nkingdoms. But Mari was doing the same and all of Ebla\\'s efforts were to no\\navail. Sometime around 2250 disaster struck. The capital was invaded and\\nconquered. The palace was burned. Who did it? No records have yet been\\nfound to identify the victor but all assume it was Mari and/or her allies.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Testimony to Mesopotamian civilization long before 2348 BC</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nNow for a look at the larger picture. A fragment here, an inscription\\nthere, a few artifacts, radiometric dating. They hardly make a case for\\n2348 BC being too late. Even the 20,000-30,000 documents and fragments at\\nMari dating around 1800 BC can be explained by those using the Ussher\\nchronology approach.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBut the dates Ebla establishes are formidable. Archaeologists have\\ndetermined that while Ebla was attacked and destroyed at various times, it\\nwas generally occupied between 3000 BC and 1500 BC. Yet in just 150 years\\nof that 1500-year period (2400 B.C.-2250 B.C.), the cuneiform records\\nreveal that an astonishing civilization developed under five kings,\\ncomplete with division of labor, education and highly specialized jobs.\\nWomen held positions in government and made decisions. By the time of its\\nfall an estimated 12,000 civil workers served the palace, nearly 1000 of\\nwhich were involved in record keeping. The capital city and its suburbs\\ncontained a quarter of a million people. The king was the equivalent of a\\nmodern CEO of a multinational corporation.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nEbla\\'s non-economic tablets contained a host of additional subjects. Most\\ncrucial are its records of past rulers, military battles and relations with\\nother kingdoms. To some extent they reflect Ebla\\'s history from its\\nfounding around 3000 BC until 2250 BC. On the other hand, since Mari\\'s\\ntablets date to 1800 BC, those tablets reflect the history of that kingdom\\nfrom about 2600 B.C. to it\\'s fall, confirming the overlapping Mari time\\nwith Ebla.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nTo restate, most of the Ebla palace tablets were written over just a\\n40-year period of Ebla\\'s 1500-year history, from about 2290-2250 BC. Yet\\nthey only exist because of the rarest of events, baked hard by a fire. How\\nmany were written during the rest of Ebla\\'s 1500-year history that perished\\nthrough the ages? What about the cuneiform documents written in other\\nMesopotamian cities? Sumer had 18 principal cities in Southern Mesopotamia\\naround 2000 BC. Yet most have produced only small quantities of tablets and\\nsome of those cities have yet to even be identified. On the other hand,\\ntravelers to Ur in the 18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> centuries said\\nthe ground was so strewn with tablets that it was hard to avoid stepping on\\nthem. Then there are the other dozen or so major cities of the Greater Near\\nEast. They also were able to write yet in most of them archaeologists have\\nfound few tablets.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWould it be too much to say that hundreds of millions of tablets were\\nwritten in that area during the nearly three millennia in which cuneiform\\nscript was used? Greater Mesopotamia contained a dozen major nations or\\ncity-states and numerous lesser people groups that authenticated each other\\nin dozens of ways. The same picture was found across the region. First one\\ndominated, then another. They traded with each other. They fought with each\\nother. They recorded treaties, histories of the area, lists of kings, names\\nof buildings, even solar and lunar eclipses. They told stories about the\\nCreator. In a myriad of ways they authenticated each other. How many are\\nneeded to establish beyond question that civilization was well established\\ngoing back to 3000 BC?\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWhat are the 2348 BC people going to do? Denying Ebla\\'s library is\\nimpossible. It was enormous. Its words testify to highly organized\\ncivilizations at a time when the loudest voices in the creation science\\nmovement say Noah\\'s Flood occurred. People like Josephus, the church\\nfathers and Ussher were unaware of the Archive\\'s existence. It had\\ndisappeared from human knowledge from about 2250 BC until 1975 AD. Now it\\nhas been found and fascinates us with its history. By comparison most of\\nthe 900 Dead Sea Scrolls consist of collections of verses or part of a\\nchapter of the Bible. Only one, the Isaiah Scroll, contains a complete book\\nof the Bible-the full text of all 66 chapters of that book.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSome will claim this is all made up, that these are just the words of those\\nwith academic credentials and that the Word of God is greater than any\\nacademic credential. Such a claim is a half-truth. For certain the Word of\\nGod is greater than any academic credential. But the Word of God itself\\ntestifies to much time passing after the Flood before Abraham was born in\\nSumerian Ur. As to the genealogy of Shem, it is better understood as a\\nrecord of 45-65 generations than ten. This places the Flood 1300-1900 years\\nearlier than those who defend the Ussher date. Nevertheless, recognizing a\\nmajor new idea in Scripture can take years or even lifetimes. Some will not\\naccept this truth until they get to heaven.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Putting the Discovery of Written Records in Perspective</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nOne of the early criticisms of the Bible was that Moses (1526 B.C-1406\\nB.C.) could not have written the Pentateuch since writing was not yet\\ninvented. Now we learn that people wrote 1500 years before Moses. But those\\nthousand or so cuneiform symbols limited reading and writing to a select\\nfew. Even at the time when most of the Ebla tablets were written between\\n2290 and 2250 BC, people in the Kingdom of Ebla still had to learn some 600\\nsymbols to read and write. One hundred years later Abraham grew up in Ur\\nwhere boys learned to read and write and even do modern high school math,\\nall using the cuneiform system of writing. Amazingly cuneiform continued to\\nbe used until just several hundred years before Christ. In contrast the\\nPhoenician Alphabet which appeared around 1000 BC contained 22 consonants\\nand no vowels. It was spread by Phoenician merchants and adopted with\\nmodifications by Greeks and Hebrews, among many other peoples in that\\nregion.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIn contrast with these written records are other evidences that speak of\\nextensive human activity in the region where the Flood survivors began to\\nrebuild the world\\'s population. Some, like radio isotope dating, are\\nmisdirected, building on the premise that the world is billions of years\\nold, so its conclusion supports its premise and that is a logical fallacy\\ncalled circular reasoning. Even such approaches as pottery dating and the\\nuse of materials for tools such as stone, bronze and iron can be\\nmisleading. But written documents have the greatest credibility and to some\\nextent can be weighed objectively.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWhere did the Church Fathers and Bishop Ussher go wrong? They failed to\\nrecognize the hidden beauty of Hebrew genealogies and instead treated those\\ngenealogies as secular societies used them. They overlooked the gradual\\ndecline of longevity after the Flood and the 1300-1900 years of history\\nthat passed between Eber and Peleg.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe Ebla tablets plus tens of thousands found at other locations reveal\\nexactly what the Bible records of life recovering after the world-wide\\nFlood. As descendants of the eight Ark survivors migrated from the\\nmountains of Ararat to the plains of Southern Mesopotamia over the next 200\\nyears, they defied God\\'s instructions to repopulate the entire earth and\\nfounded the first advanced civilization at Babel. While they did not\\ndevelop a written language, they did build a city and a tower reaching to\\nheaven. God saw what they were doing and stated \"Nothing that they propose\\nto do will now be impossible for them\" (Genesis 11:6). In judgment God\\nconfused their language which caused this advanced civilization to\\nreproduce itself in dozens of locations across Greater Mesopotamia and\\nArabia.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nExplorers took this advanced civilization to other favorable locations to\\nestablish similar civilizations in the river valleys of Egypt, India and\\nChina. Those who encountered the Ice Age in the upper latitudes adopted\\nprimitive Stone Age hunting-gathering lifestyles to survive. This is the\\npicture Scripture paints and it is confirmed by the findings of\\narchaeology. Archaeologists puzzle over why civilization developed that\\nspecific way in the very recent historic past. The Bible has the answer-the\\neight Ark survivors reestablished mankind after the Great Flood in a world\\nof new land forms and climate.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Funerary Avenues in Arabia</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBreaking headlines report a large population in Saudi Arabia at the time of\\nJob: On 1/12/2022, multiple news stories on the Internet reported the\\ndiscovery of vast numbers of tombs in Saudi Arabia dating between 2600 and\\n2000 BC. The tombs line major routes to the north of Medina Arabia\\nconnecting long-established centers. These networks are called    <em>funerary avenues</em>. They stretch \"for hundreds of kilometers and\\npossibly thousands.\" While they are well known to local residents,\\narchaeologists only recently took serious interest in them. Over the last\\nyear they have counted around 18,000 tombs but expect to spend years\\npursuing this new field of research and find many more.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWalls up to six feet high surround each tomb. In aerial photographs they\\nare obvious and at times tightly packed together. The tombs are either\\nround or pendant in shape, and are still standing to their original height.\\n\"The level of preservation is unbelievable,\" said one archaeologist. It is\\ninitially thought that the occupants farmed the land nearby and their tombs\\nwere placed on the highway so their descendants would remember them. A\\nsimilar custom was linked to Greece and Rome in later history. Since\\nsimilar tombs are found in Yemen, the avenues may stretch that far.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n(Aside-Why did relatives stop building them around 2000 BC? <em>HB</em>\\nwould answer: \"The Ice Age had come to an end so the rain it delivered\\nstopped, the vegetation dried up, the population moved away and the land\\nhas been barren, uninhabitable desert ever since.\")\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThis 4,500-year-old Arabian network of highways lined with well-preserved\\ntombs joins Ebla\\'s thousands of written documents dated between 2400 and\\n2250 BC to verify that civilization was going full tilt when some teach the\\nFlood occurred. Therefore, the idea found in <em>HB</em> that Moses\\nfollowed the common Hebrew practice of omitting generations when he\\nrecorded Shem\\'s list can hardly be dismissed.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<a name=\"_Hlk105607072\">\\n    <strong>Claims of Alternate ANE chronologies </strong>\\n</a>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nDavid Rohl maintains that the chronology of pharaohs is wrong, that the\\nMiddle Kingdom dates are 300 years too early. He says dynasties in Upper\\nEgypt and Lower Egypt coexisted but scholars have treated their years\\nlinearly so when the duplications are removed Egypt\\'s chronology agrees\\nwith his dating of the Exodus. A leading creation scientist cites Rohl\\'s\\nwork to justify accepting Shem\\'s genealogy as complete so just who is David\\nRohl and what do real scholars think of his work?\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nRohl says he became enamored with Egypt at the age of 11 when his family\\nwas treated to a Nile River boat ride on King Farouk\\'s stern wheeler. In\\nadulthood he formed a rock band and recorded several albums. He worked as a\\nsound technician but on the side he read about ancient Egyptian and Near\\nEast history. He had a fertile imagination and began writing fiction with\\nthe Near East as background. In his forties he earned a bachelor degree in\\nEgyptian studies and continues to promote his ideas about Egyptian\\nchronology.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWhat does the scholarly world think of his chronology? No Egyptologist has\\nendorsed his idea. Kenneth Kitchen, renowned Egyptologist has a single word\\nfor 300 too many years in the Egyptian chronology, \"nonsense.\" As to Rohl\\'s\\nbeliefs, he is an agnostic. He believes the Bible is a record of ancient\\nhistory just like many other histories but he does not believe it is the\\ninspired Word of God. Why would any creationist place greater faith in this\\nman than in true inerrancy biblical scholars? There can be but one\\nanswer-Rohl confirms their misinterpretation of Hebrew genealogies.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nTruth be told, secular scholars have produced a range of\\nchronologies-short, shorter, long, longer, median, etc. Their median\\nchronology seems to work pretty well with the biblical chronology once\\nHebrew genealogical practice is factored in. The shortened chronologies of\\nRohl and others actually conflict with the Scriptural timeline.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Claim that the Bible Borrowed from Cuneiform Tablets</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAn entire pole (or world) away is a line of secular thinking summarized by\\nfree-lance writer Joshua Mark that myths found in ancient cuneiform tablets\\nwere borrowed and embellished by Jewish scribes and became stories in the\\nBible. The following quotes are taken from an article by him published in<em>Ancient History Encyclopedia</em>:    <a href=\"#_ftn9\" name=\"_ftnref9\" title=\"\">[9]</a> \"When the ancient\\ncuneiform tablets of Mesopotamia were discovered and deciphered in the late\\n19<sup>th</sup> century CE, they would literally transform human\\nunderstanding of history.\"\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nHow did they transform mankind\\'s understanding of history? Mark explains,\\n\"Prior to their discovery the Bible was considered the oldest and most\\nauthoritative book in the world. The brilliant scholar and translator\\nGeorge Smith (1840-1876 CE) changed the understanding of history with his\\ntranslation of <em>The Epic of Gilgamesh</em> in 1872 CE. This translation\\nallowed other cuneiform tablets to be interpreted which overturned the\\ntraditional understanding of the biblical version of history and made room\\nfor scholarly, objective explanations of history to move forward.\"\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nHow did <em>The Epic of Gilgamesh</em> and other cuneiform tablets replace\\nthe Bible\\'s version of history? Mark continues: \"Many biblical texts were\\nthought to be original until cuneiform was deciphered. The Fall of Man and\\nthe Great Flood were understood as literal events in human history dictated\\nby God to the author (or authors) of Genesis but were now recognized as\\nMesopotamian myths in <em>The Myth of Etana</em> and the <em>Atrahasis</em>\\nwhich Hebrew scribes had embellished. The Garden of Eden could now be\\nunderstood as a myth derived from <em>The Enuma Elish</em> and other\\nMesopotamian works. The Book of Job, far from being an actual historical\\naccount of an individual\\'s unjust suffering, could now be recognized as a\\nliterary piece belonging to a Mesopotamian tradition following the\\ndiscovery of the earlier <em>Ludlul-Bel-Nimegi</em> text which relates a\\nsimilar story.\"\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWait a minute! Mark is saying that the stories found in the Torah written\\nor edited by Moses during Israel\\'s 40 years of wilderness wandering and\\ntaught by Christians as authentic revelations from God is a false\\nexplanation of their origin. Rather, he says, they were Mesopotamian myths\\nthat preceded Moses who borrowed and embellished them. But couldn\\'t it be\\nthe other way around? Couldn\\'t those biblical events have just as well\\nhappened first and over the millennia as they were told and retold, they\\nwere distorted into the recorded Mesopotamian myths? The dates of those\\ntablets and the actual events are millennia apart. The tablets translated\\nby George Smith dated to the early 2<sup>nd</sup> millennium BC. The Flood\\noccurred two millennia before the date of those tablets and the stories of\\nAdam and Eve and the Fall occurred four millennia before. If the Babylonian\\nmyths reflected true events that happened millennia before, wouldn\\'t they\\nbe greatly distorted as they were told and retold for those thousands of\\nyears?\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nEven more important the quality of the Babylonian stories is childish in\\ncomparison with these stories recorded in the Bible. These scholars who are\\nmaking room for objective explanations of history don\\'t spend much time\\nwith the details of those Babylonian myths. Gilgamesh\\'s record of the Ark,\\nfor instance, describes it as a cube, 100 x 100 x 100. How long would its\\npassengers last as this cube tumbled in the waters of the Great Flood? But,\\nof course, it is just a myth so it is not surprising that its details are\\nridiculous. Why don\\'t these critics examine the details of the biblical\\nstory of the Flood? They would quickly learn that the dimensions of the\\nBible\\'s Ark are as up to date as those of today\\'s ocean-going freighters.\\nThe two-page story about the undeserved suffering of a Babylonian man has\\nthe quality of a grade schooler\\'s composition when compared with the\\nforty-two chapters of the Book of Job and its host of brilliant ideas.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nMark has it backwards. As the stories of early human history beginning with\\nAdam were told and retold, they would have become more and more distorted\\nuntil they landed in the writings of ancient Mesopotamia millennia later as\\nmyths and legends. Mark\\'s explanation is the idea of scientific evolution\\napplied to the field of ancient literature-things working their way to\\nperfection rather than drifting downhill. Anyone working in the legal field\\nof court testimony knows the difficulty of a witness keeping his facts\\nstraight. Repeating second hand information becomes even less reliable and\\nthird hand information is frequently dismissed as uncertain. Gilgamesh\\'s\\nexploits placed side by side with Holy Scripture are as different as night\\nand day, as great as the difference between children playing soccer on a\\nvacant lot and a contest between leading professional soccer teams.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe on-line Ancient History Encyclopedia carrying Mark\\'s piece was founded\\nin 2009 with the mission of improving history education worldwide. Its\\nvision is to create open-minded and tolerant societies. It endeavors to\\nhelp teachers, students and schools by providing reliable resources for\\nfree. It is now the largest and most popular history encyclopedia on the\\ninternet, recommended by the likes of Oxford, Michigan State and the\\nUniversity of Minnesota. How alarming that the world\\'s largest and most\\npopular history encyclopedia on the internet is publishing such\\ndisinformation. But one thing the article does do is highlight just how\\nsuperior the record of Scripture is over the clouded minds of those captive\\nto the enemy.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThis book, <em>The Hidden Beauty of Hebrew Genealogies</em>, is not about\\nwhat the many learned disciplines say although they say much. Nor does it\\nput a spin on what the Bible reveals. Rather it carefully examines in great\\ndetail the very Word of God on the subject. An enormous amount of material\\nhas been examined. Consistently and without exception, Scripture supports\\nthe premise of this book. At the same time support against it has\\nevaporated into thin air. In the end it is the case against it that is\\nmissing. So for seventeen chapters this book has focused primarily on just\\none source-Scripture. Most will confess to shock in finding that as many as\\n55 generations and maybe even more were omitted from Shem\\'s genealogy, but\\nthe examination of Scripture leads to such a conclusion.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWhy wasn\\'t this book written long before by any of the tens of thousands of\\ncapable Bible scholars? Why wasn\\'t it written even as early as the Church\\nFathers? This book is filled with the answers-the deficiency of Exodus\\n12:40, historical errors, ignorance of the Dead Sea Scrolls and Ebla\\nTablets, lack of creation models for the Flood and ignorance of the Ice\\nAge. The Church Fathers had none of these resources to assist them. Neither\\ndid Ussher, Newton or the KJV translators. Rather, these resources are all\\nrecent. As they came to light, they led to corrections of\\nmisinterpretations of Scripture. In effect God has used in recent times an\\narmy of folks in various disciplines to provide the raw material for this\\nbook. Our hat is off to them. So the current picture allows for this book\\nand the many others that will surely follow.\\n</p>\\n<br clear=\"all\"/>\\n<div>\\n<br clear=\"all\"/>\\n<hr width=\"33%\" size=\"1\" align=\"left\"/>\\n<div id=\"ftn1\">\\n    <p>\\n        <a href=\"#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\" title=\"\"></a>\\n        <sup>75 </sup>\\nAllan R.

Yes, but Scripture warns us to be careful with\\nthem. Chapter one observed the Apostle Paul's directive to Timothy:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    <sup>3</sup>\\n    As I urged you when I went to Macedonia, remain in Ephesus so that you\\n    may instruct certain people not to teach false doctrine <sup>4</sup>or\\n    to pay attention to myths and endless genealogies. These promote empty\\nspeculations rather than God's plan, which operates by faith.        <sup>5</sup>Now the goal of our instruction is love that comes from a\\n    pure heart, a good conscience, and a sincere faith. <sup>6</sup>Some\\nhave departed from these and turned aside to fruitless discussion.        <sup>7</sup>They want to be teachers of the law, although they don't\\n    understand what they are saying or what they are insisting on. 1\\n    Timothy 1:3-7 (CSB).\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIn a word genealogies can be harmful. They can even be used to teach false\\ndoctrine. They can go on and on, advance myths and promote speculation as\\nopposed to God's plan. In contrast, this book has restricted itself to what\\nScripture discloses of them. It has functioned under the principle Paul\\nwould later write Timothy that \\\"All Scripture is God-breathed and\\nprofitable\\\" (II Timothy 3:16). The revelation God has given concerning\\ngenealogies cannot be harmful; only its distortions can be.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWe began with the genealogy of Aaron listing four names to cover four\\ncenturies. Obviously, names were skipped. Some therefore conclude Israel\\ndidn't sojourn in Egypt for four centuries. Chapter two acknowledged that\\nnot just Moses, but God and Stephen also testified to four centuries in\\nEgypt. When Joseph invited his father to move to Egypt to survive the\\nfamine, Jacob paused before departing the land of promise. God spoke to\\nhim, repeating the promises He gave to Abraham and Isaac one last time. God\\nstated specifically that it would be in Egypt that Jacob's descendants\\nwould increase to the numbers that comprise a nation. Thus, he was not to\\nfear moving to Egypt.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nPaul spoke of 430-years from the promise to the law. Since Paul would not\\ncontradict God (Genesis 15:13), his words must be interpreted to mean\\nIsrael would sojourn in Egypt 430-years following those many times God gave\\nthe promises to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and concluding when He gave the\\nlaw at Mount Sinai. Thus, Paul's words also support four centuries in\\nEgypt.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nOthers reply, \\\"What about Abraham's call? Doesn't the order of the text\\nsuggest it came in Haran, not Ur? They conclude, \\\"Those 430-years began\\nwith God's call to Abraham in Haran and ended with the Exodus.\\\" Chapters\\nthree and four corrected this, showing conclusively that Abraham's calling\\nfrom God came to him at Ur of the Chaldees in southern Mesopotamia, not in\\nHaran. As to the order of the text, Scripture finishes the Terah section in\\nGenesis 11 before beginning the Abraham section in chapter 12. In addition,\\nnumerous other misinterpretations in the accounts of Abraham and Jacob used\\nto support the 215-year error are corrected.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nChapter five is the heart of this book. It explored many of the over 300\\ninstances in the Old Testament where filial terms are used in a broad\\nsense. While \\\"son\\\" and \\\"father\\\" normally refer to an immediate\\nrelationship, Hebrew writers often used them in the sense of someone\\nfurther down or up the line. When filial terms were used this way in a\\ngenealogy, that list would be incomplete. Chapter six presented 15 examples\\nof genealogies that skip generations by using filial terms in a broad\\nsense.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nCreation is the primary evidence for the existence of God. About two\\ncenturies ago the idea of evolution arose. Evolution's explanation for the\\nexistence of all things is time, not God. According to evolution billions\\nof years brought about the material universe. The Bible indicates God\\ncreated the universe and man thousands, not billions of years ago.\\nCreationists reject the idea of vast eons of time. But some have added the\\nyears in the genealogies of Shem and Adam to give specific dates for the\\nFlood and Creation. If those lists are incomplete, their dates are wrong\\nand they discredit creation science.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nChapter seven addresses Shem's list and shows that it skips 35-55\\ngenerations, pushing the date of the Flood back many years. This finding is\\nconsistent with the thinking of most Old Testament inerrancy scholars that\\nShem's list is incomplete. The approximate year of the Flood dogmatically\\ndeclared by certain fellow believers who insist that Shem's list is\\ncomplete is beyond doubt too late. Nowhere in Scripture is the date for the\\nFlood given or even hinted at. This book concludes that at best Shem's\\ngenealogy only provides a range of years in which the Flood occurred. Those\\nwho date the Flood by adding the numbers in Shem's list provide an easy\\ntarget for dismissing all who appeal to the Bible as authoritative.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe purpose of most biblical genealogies is to relate descendants to\\nforefathers and forefathers to descendants without the necessity of naming\\nevery person in the genealogical line. When this purpose is understood,\\nconflicts between the words of Scripture and the numbers found in the\\ngenealogies are avoided. Thus, a true understanding of the genealogies\\nglorifies God as we handle His Word. That has been the goal of this book.\\nIt has found that beyond question Hebrew genealogies do not always consist\\nof immediate father-son dependencies. This understanding frees us from\\nwresting other passages of Scriptures in an effort to date the earth to an\\nexact number of years as did Archbishop James Ussher in    <em>Annals of the World</em>. Yet, neither do we accept evolution's\\nbillions-of-years view.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nPaul's words about genealogies come at the beginning of his letter to\\nTimothy. He will speak on many subjects before he is done but this message\\nwas uppermost in his mind. He states his motive for bringing up the\\nsubject: \\\"The aim of our charge is love that issues from a pure heart and a\\ngood conscience and a sincere faith.\\\" I Timothy 1:5. Paul loved the new\\nEphesian converts as he loved all converts. He didn't want to see their\\nChristian lives bound by false Bible teaching. His motive was pure, his\\nconscience unviolated, his faith intact.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBut according to Paul those who taught on genealogies had a different\\nmotive. It was not a careful investigation to see what the Old Testament\\nactually taught. Their goal was to so teach genealogies that gentiles would\\nbe forced to embrace the Mosaic law and in effect become Jewish proselytes.\\nPaul said they did not understand what they were talking about (1:7).\\nEphesians chapters two and three shows that gentiles came to Christ apart\\nfrom the law. Paul did not identify those who incorrectly taught\\ngenealogies. He simply refers to them as \\\"Certain persons\\\" (1:6). Timothy\\nwould know who Paul was referring to.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nFast forward to today. Certain persons teach that the Bible reveals the\\ndates of the Flood and Creation. They say those dates are revealed in the\\ngenealogies of Shem (Genesis 11) and Adam (Genesis 5). They say that adding\\nthe numbers in Shem's list discloses the date of the Flood and continuing\\nby adding the numbers in Adam's list discloses the date of Creation. But\\nthose dates are not found in Scripture and it would seem that such\\nimportant dates would be clearly stated if God wanted them known. So\\ninstead of appealing to the clear statements of Scripture, these certain\\nbrethren appeal to genealogies.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBut what is their motive? The motive of those Paul wrote Timothy about was\\nno secret. It was to force gentiles to accept the entire Mosaic Law. One of\\ntheir tools was an erroneous teaching of genealogies. Now for the critical\\nquestion: what is the motive of those who appeal to genealogies today? If\\nit is to learn what the Bible teaches about genealogies as this book\\nattempts to do, that would be a good motive. If their motive is to study\\nthose early Hebrew genealogies, they would address them at length, but they\\ndon't. Rather, their motive is something else. It is an attempt to declare\\nthose elusive dates.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nChallenge to the reader: study the arguments of this book. Are they sound?\\nDo they make sense? Are they correct? If you have come to believe so, you\\nwill become a part of history, helping to correct a biblical error that has\\npersisted in the church for two thousand years. What will you accomplish?\\nUnbelievers will not be impressed with your new view that maybe the earth\\nis 2000 years older than Bible students previously thought. But the global\\nFlood depositing the many sedimentary layers on the surface of the earth\\nabout 3600 to 4300 BC will impress some. Much evidence supports such a\\nrange of dates. It will be hard to refute. This will result in some\\nunbelievers having a higher regard for the Bible and will also support the\\nwork of creation scientists. For believers, it will further confirm that\\nthe Bible is true history.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSo much of the Bible includes genealogies that we would be amiss in not\\nunderstanding the Holy Spirit's true purpose for them. Rightly understood\\nthey are a blessing and have been a great blessing to the author. Hopefully\\nthese truths will likewise inform your faith and make it stronger.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIn our zeal for the inerrancy of the Scriptures, we learned more about the\\ndear souls God included in His word along with their exploits and failures.\\nWe gained new insights into relationships and their consequences. People\\nand their relationships are important to God-even our names-even our\\norganization-what we do for Him and how we do it. In the end our biggest\\nconcern is what the hymn writer said:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    <em>Lord, I care not for riches, neither silver nor gold,</em>\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    <em>I would make sure of Heaven, I would enter the fold.</em>\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong><em>In the book of Thy kingdom with its pages so fair</em></strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    <em>Tell me, Jesus my Savior, Is my name written there?</em>\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong><em>Is my name written there?</em></strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong><em>On the page white and fair?</em></strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong><em>In the book of Thy kingdom, </em></strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong><em>Is my name written there?</em></strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nTherefore, as we leave this subject of Hebrew genealogies with over 160,000\\nwords, we hope no one will still be asking what difference 2000 years of\\nhuman history makes anyway and, really, what's the big deal?\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nTo them we answer, after all, what difference does correct Bible teaching\\nmake anyway? It makes a huge difference. There is a grave penalty for\\nteaching the Word of God incorrectly. James 3:1 gives this sober warning:\\n\\\"Be not many of you teachers, my brothers, knowing that we shall receive\\nthe heavier judgment.\\\" Clearly God does not take incorrect Bible teaching\\nlightly and if He doesn't, neither should we.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nGlory to God.

The key issue is whether Hebrew\\ngenealogies are abbreviated, how frequently and under what circumstances.\\nThe first four chapters are needed just to present an open/shut case for\\nthe condensing of the Levi-Aaron list of Exodus 6 and Numbers 26. The\\napproach of the book is to observe what the inerrant Scriptures themselves\\nsay and then draw conclusions from those observations which the reader can\\nweigh. It is not a survey of what others have said. That must be left to\\nothers. It concludes that 35-55 generations are omitted between Eber and\\nPeleg (E&amp;P) and that the Flood happened 1500 to 2100 years earlier than\\ngenerally understood.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThis book is long because so many issues cloud the subject-from the nature\\nof Hebrew genealogies to the lives of the Patriarchs to the accuracy of the\\nexisting text through history and on and on. Both little known and even new\\nthoughts are found throughout the reading. Below is a summary of the book\\'s\\nfindings, but their support will only be discovered through the reading of\\nthe entire book. They are listed in the order of the most relevant findings\\nto the conclusion of the book. Upon completing the book, it should be clear\\nwhether its conclusion is reasonably supported.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    1. The gradual decrease of longevity after the Flood with one exception\\n</strong>\\n. Human longevity slowly decreased after the Flood from 438 to 70 years. In\\nShem\\'s record of Genesis 11 the decline between the first and second names\\nwas five years and between the fourth and sixth names was 4.5 years per\\ngeneration. This gradual decline continued until Moses\\' day at rates as\\nhigh as seven or eight years per generation with one exception. The decline\\nbetween the third and fourth names was 225 years or 61% of the total\\n368-year decline. While it appears to come between two otherwise\\nstraight-forward consecutive generations, it is the clue to the omission of\\nmany, many generations.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>2. An immediate halving of Post-Flood Lifespans</strong>\\n. While this study concludes that the decline between Eber and Peleg was\\nthe result of omitting an estimated 35-55 generations, it must be\\ndistinguished from the immediate halving of post-Flood lifespans. Scripture\\nrecords that those who lived and died before the Flood all lived about 900\\nyears. Without exception all eight listed names lived about that long. Yet\\nthe first three generations born after the Flood lived just half as long.\\nThese are facts declared by Scripture.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    3. Recognizing a sufficient cause for the immediate halving.\\n</strong>\\nWhat caused the immediate halving? Recognizing the Flood\\'s unimaginable\\nviolence triggers the solution. Twice God spoke of the Flood destroying the\\nearth (Genesis 6:13; 9:11). The planet remained but its crust was wracked\\nby forces beyond comprehension. After this violence the reproductive\\ngenetics of all on the Ark could only produce progeny living half as long\\nas those who lived and died before the Flood. Longevity charts of the past\\nincluded Noah and Shem. They were born with pre-Flood genetics, but they\\nlived after the Flood as well so they are exceptions. Consequently, they\\ncannot be used to determine longevity declines.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>4. The misguided chrono-genealogy interpretation</strong>\\n. Some suggest that the numbers when each father had his son in Genesis 11\\nestablish a chronology and even if there are omitted names, the number\\nmarks the years until the next named son. The issue here is how to treat\\ndetails about the parents preceding an omitted name. That issue is solved\\nwith the Levi genealogy of Exodus 6 and Numbers 26. The names involved are\\nLevi-Kohath-Amram-Aaron. Names are omitted between Amram and Aaron. Six\\ndetails are given about Amram\\'s wife-her name, her father (Levi), her\\ncountry of birth, etc. They are true of the mother of Amram\\'s unnamed son,\\nnot Aaron who was born 300 years after Amram. Chapter one of    <em>Hidden Beauty</em> spells this out in careful detail. The omission of\\nnames between Amram and Aaron is indisputable.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>5. The purpose of the begat numbers</strong>\\n. Chrono-genealogy advocates support their argument by saying the purpose\\nfor giving each father\\'s age when he begat his heir in Genesis 11 is to\\nprovide a timeline of history. Yet nowhere does Scripture state this or any\\nother purpose for providing those numbers. If Moses summed them or if they\\nwere summed elsewhere in Scripture, we would know beyond doubt that they\\nwere provided to be summed. Elsewhere Scripture provides critical numbers\\nand even sums entire periods of time: lifespans of Abraham, Isaac and\\nJacob; 430- year sojourn in Egypt; 480-year period between the Exodus and\\nthe Temple. It might be argued that the silence of Scripture is an argument\\nfrom silence and could just as easily be used for adding those numbers. But\\non the face of it, which is more likely-that the numbers were not added\\nbecause they would give the wrong answer or that they were not added\\nbecause the reader was expected to add them?\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>6. Israel\\'s sojourn in Egypt: 430, not 215-years.</strong>\\nOf all the dates for the Flood determined by summing the numbers of Shem\\'s\\nlist, the 2348 BC date published in 1650 by Archbishop James Ussher is the\\nbest known. Ussher was a first-rate Bible scholar but he was limited to the\\nsources of his day and they contained multiple errors, especially a textual\\nproblem in Exodus 12:40. As a result, like most before him he understood\\nMoses\\' words to support a 215-year Egyptian sojourn. Two hundred years\\nafter Ussher\\'s death the textual problem was finally solved. Today, nearly\\nevery modern English Bible reads \"The time that the people of Israel lived\\nin Egypt was 430-years.\" But all along Scripture had provided four\\nwitnesses to a 430-year sojourn in Egypt: God (Genesis 15:16), Moses\\n(Exodus 12:40), Stephen (Acts 7:6) and Paul (Galatians 3:17).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>7. Questionable Scriptural Interpretations</strong>\\n. Numerous unreasonable interpretations and even contradictions appear when\\nShem\\'s genealogy is viewed as complete. In chapter 15    <em>Hidden Beauty</em> lists around 45 that were identified and corrected\\nin the preceding chapters and it certainly did not find them all. These\\ndifficulties disappear when the Bible student acknowledges the omission of\\n35-55 names.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>8. The practice of condensing Hebrew genealogies</strong>\\n. It is a fact that Old Testament genealogies, at times, are abbreviated.\\nIt was a Hebrew practice. <em>Hidden Beauty</em> gives 16 examples in\\nchapters six and seven. Even the line from Perez to David was shrunk by\\nabout 2/3<sup>rds </sup>in Ruth 4 (ten names instead of an estimated 27-30)\\nand repeated in exactly the same order in I Chronicles 2, Matthew 1 and\\nLuke 3. Intentionally condensing Shem\\'s genealogy was consistent with\\nHebrew practice.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>9. The simplicity of Hebrew family terms.</strong>\\nThe nature of Hebrew kinship terms makes abbreviating genealogies possible.\\nHebrews used simple words for family relationships. \"Son\" could refer to a\\nfather\\'s immediate male offspring, his grandson or even a distant\\ndescendant. Matthew 1:1 uses \"son\" in this very way: \"Jesus Christ, the son\\nof David.\" Even the verb \"to bear, to beget\" was used in this way. This\\nsimplicity allowed much flexibility in expressing relationships based on\\nbirth. It allowed for brevity. A long list could be shortened to just the\\ntribe, clan and family before naming the individual. The primary purpose of\\nHebrew lists was to identify ancestors with descendants and descendants\\nwith ancestors. Therefore, in most cases a complete list was at the\\ndiscretion of the author.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>10. The biblical pattern of condensed genealogies</strong>\\n. Scripture (often) follows a pattern when generations are skipped and\\nShem\\'s list follows this pattern-the gap comes after three consecutive\\nnames. When more time is covered, lists contain more structure. The\\nfollowing examples work from the simplest structure to the most extensive.\\nThe purpose of omitting names was efficiency. Why trouble the reader with\\nnumerous unknown people when it was unnecessary? Various clues often help\\nto estimate how many generations were omitted.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAaron\\'s list began with the typical three names and ends with his:\\nLevi-Kohath-Amram-(an 8 to 12 generation gap)-Aaron. Korah who challenged\\nAaron\\'s leadership and Dathan and Abiram, who challenged Moses\\' leadership,\\nfollow the pattern of Aaron\\'s list: Levi-Kohath-Izhar-(an 8 to 12\\ngeneration gap)-Korah; Reuben-Pallu-Eliab-(a 9 to 13 generation gap)-Dathan\\nand Abiram. For clarity the structure may also include the father or even\\nthe grandfather of the individual: Judah (tribe)-Zerah (clan)-Zabdi\\n(family)-(a 10 to 14 generation gap)-Carmi (father)-Achan. The Judah-David\\nlist covers 900 years so it contains more structure. It consists of ten\\nnames in three groups of three consecutive names separated by two gaps and\\nconcludes with David: Perez (son of Judah)-Hezron-Ram-gap of 8 to 10\\ngenerations; Amminadab-Nashon-Salmon-gap of 9 to 11 generations;\\nBoaz-Obed-Jesse (third set of three consecutive names)-David.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nShem\\'s list covers about 2000 years and follows the structure of David\\'s\\nlist. It consists of ten names beginning with the patriarch Shem followed\\nby three groups of three names. Group one consists of the first three\\ngenerations born after the Flood. Group two consists of the three names\\nimmediately following the 35-55 generation gap. Group three consists of the\\nthree names of Abraham\\'s immediate family: his grandfather, father and\\nhimself. It is possible that a small gap exists between the second and\\nthird sets of names. Here is the pattern: Shem (born before the Flood);\\nArpachshad-Shelah-Eber-35 to 55 generation gap; Peleg-Reu-Serug-a possible\\nbrief gap of up to six names; Nahor-Terah-Abraham.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>11. The meaning of Peleg\\'s name</strong>\\n. A strong argument for the late Flood date has been that Peleg\\'s name\\nmeans \"to divide\" and that he was given this name because shortly before\\nhis birth God divided the human race by languages at the Tower of Babel\\njudgment. Summing the years indicates he was born 101 years after the\\nFlood. Since four generations is reasonable for 101 years, this argument\\nconcludes that no names are missing. Language scholar and Hebrew professor\\nBernard E Northrup (1925-2008) observed that Peleg\\'s name meant \"divided by\\nwater,\" not merely \"to divide.\" He got this meaning from an extensive study\\nof the Hebrew words formed from the root of Peleg\\'s name (PLG). Of the 17\\ntimes the noun is found in the Old Testament, Strong found it meant stream\\nor river ten times (Strong word number 6378) and the son of Eber seven\\ntimes (word #6379). Rivers and streams obviously divide things.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIn a broader search, whether Northrup looked at Hebrew PLG words in their\\nother parts of speech, PLG words in related Semitic languages and even PLG\\nwords in unrelated languages, those three letters often had something to do\\nwith water or a division related to water. Northrup found 18 such PLG words\\nassociated with water in classical Greek alone. Even in English he found\\nPLG words associated with water: pelagic depths and archipelago. While he\\nbelieved the division was caused by the breakup of the super continent,\\ncurrent thinking points to Ice Age melt raising sea level to increase open\\nwater distances between continents and islands. Peleg meaning \"divided by\\nwater\" would place his birth at the end of the Ice Age, over 1000 years\\nafter the Flood.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>12. Too little time between the Flood and Babel</strong>\\n. If the Babel judgment did occur just 101 years after the Flood, not\\nenough workers would have been available to build the city and part of the\\ntower. <em>Hidden Beauty</em> shows there would have been fewer than 100.\\nThis time argument is another strike against saying Peleg\\'s name marks the\\ndate when God stopped man from building the Tower of Babel by dividing his\\nspeech. Actually, the text seems to grant the latitude of his entire\\nlifespan. Since God\\'s judgment at Babel was an immediate act, a process\\nsuch as the final period of the Ice Age melt is a better fit for the\\nmeaning of Peleg\\'s name.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>13. The larger numbers in the Septuagint (LXX)</strong>\\n. Depending on versions, the LXX reports up to 900 more years in the Shem\\nline than the Masoretic Text (MT), placing the Flood up to a millennium\\nearlier than Ussher\\'s 2348 BC date. The LXX formed as follows: about 250 BC\\nPtolemy II Philadelphus of Egypt requested that Jewish scholars from\\nJerusalem translate their Hebrew Torah into Greek for his growing library.\\nThese scribes had different Hebrew texts to choose from. This fact was\\nunknown until recently as scholars discovered through exhaustive studies of\\nthe biblical Dead Sea Scrolls that they fall into different textual groups.\\nWhy would the scribes choose from a textual group with larger numbers\\nunless there was a sense that the Flood was earlier than a summing of MT\\nnumbers indicated? Further, the larger numbers of the LXX entered the\\nHebrew textual tradition well before 250 BC. Even further, the LXX was the\\nOld Testament of Christians for a thousand years. Today, some creation\\nscientists accept these larger numbers because they are convinced of an\\nearlier Flood date. The existence of the LXX shows that even before 250 BC\\nsome Jews preferred an earlier date for the Flood and this alerts today\\'s\\nstudents to watch for the possibility of more time as they study Shem\\'s\\nlist in the MT.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>14. The context of the Book of Job</strong>\\n. Before Northrup\\'s career change that led to teaching Hebrew for 45 years\\n(point #11), he trained to be a geologist. During his teaching career he\\nassisted Bible translators in foreign countries. Due to his faith that\\nGod\\'s works (geology) would agree with His Word (the Bible) during his\\ntravels he visited and studied more geological sites than many career\\ngeologists. He was speaking at a conference in 1971 when it struck him that\\nthe Book of Job was an Ice Age book. Since the Ice Age was previously\\npoorly understood, it is not surprising that expositors did not recognize\\nthe 15 or so different kinds of Ice Age phenomena Northrup observed in Job.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nExpositors generally missed that God in His creation discourse (Job 38-41)\\nwas establishing an extended record of the marvelous nature of His creation\\nwhich showed His love for mankind and Job. Due to evolution, they also\\nmisidentified the dinosaur God described as the long-necked, long-tailed\\nBehemoth of Job 40. Further, they missed the true identity of the only\\ncreature specifically named in the creation account and elaborated on by\\nits Creator Himself in Job 41 with as many verses as the entire creation\\naccount of Genesis 1:1-2:3. Finally, they failed to see that God\\'s true\\npurpose in allowing Job\\'s suffering was to establish at the earliest\\nopportunity the malicious intent of Satan towards humanity as portrayed in\\nthe sea monster and Job 1-2. Ice Age phenomena and Jordan\\'s dinosaurs were\\ngone by the time Abraham entered Canaan 500 years later.    <em>Hidden Beauty</em> spends three chapters on the antiquity of the book\\nof Job which shouts that Shem\\'s list omits many generations.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>15. Job\\'s 280-year lifespan</strong>\\n. How long did Job live? Simple logic applied to the clear statements of\\nScripture provides the answer. First, Scripture established a truth: \"The\\nLORD gave Job twice as much as he had before\" (Job 42:10) and \"The LORD\\nblessed the latter days of Job more than his beginning\" (Job 42:12). The\\npassage speaks of three categories of blessing: livestock, family and\\nyears. Since his first livestock were lost forever, God indeed gave him\\ntwice as many as before. But since his first ten children were in heaven,\\nhe received just ten more, so that in heaven he truly would have twice as\\nmany. As to his years before the ordeal, he still had those experiences of\\nwalking with the LORD and building a ranching empire. They were like his\\nchildren so he would only need 140 more to double them to 280. By\\ncomparison Peleg lived 239 years. The decline of longevity was 4-5 years\\nper generation at that point so Job\\'s 280 years places his birth 8-9\\ngenerations before Peleg or about 2675 BC. If Shem\\'s list is not shortened    <strong>before</strong> Peleg, Job would have been born before the Flood\\nwhich is impossible. Job\\'s 280-year lifespan may be a radically new idea to\\nthe reader and take some deep thinking to accept but the logic of animals\\nvs children and the early context of the book support it.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    16. The symmetrical Lists of Adam, Shem, Terah, Perez and Gospel of\\n    Matthew\\n</strong>\\n. Shem\\'s genealogy (Genesis 11:10-22) follows a pattern of structuring-ten\\nnames in it (Shem-Abraham) to balance the ten from creation to the Flood\\n(Adam-Noah, Genesis 5). Meredith Kline of covenant theology fame sees a\\nthird set of ten names in Terah\\'s extended family. Genesis 11:27-30 lists\\neight names while grandsons, Ishmael and Isaac, are found later in Genesis.\\nHe scores points on this idea by observing that Iscah, an otherwise obscure\\ngranddaughter is named solely to bring the number to ten. The Perez-David\\nlist of Ruth 4 also contains 10 names while omitting as many as 21 and is\\nfound in I Chronicles, Matthew and Luke. Matthew\\'s genealogy of Christ is\\nalso structured-three sets of double sevens stretching from Abraham to\\nChrist.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe structuring of lists reflects the Hebrews\\' love for certain numbers.\\nTen and seven were among the most favored. Whether a genealogical list or\\nsimply a listing of an extended family as in the case of Terah, those\\nfavored numbers are found in five associated lists. How could five\\nperfectly balanced lists containing over 100 names come about by chance?\\nThe odds must be great. More likely the authors under divine guidance\\nstructured them. While structuring does not demand omitting names, it\\nraises a substantial possibility. Some inerrancy Evangelicals lay a lot of\\nstock in biblical numbers and greatly appreciate this point.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>17. The awkward overlapping of lives</strong>\\n. If Shem\\'s list is not abbreviated between <strong>E&amp;P</strong>,\\naccording to the numbers found in Scripture, Shem who was born before the\\nFlood would have outlived seven of the first eight generations born after\\nthe Flood; the first three fathers born in the new world, Arpachshad,\\nShelah and Eber, would have outlived many generations born after them; and\\nShem\\'s great grandson Eber would have outlived the next five generations\\nafter him. In contrast this extreme overlapping is not found after Eber in\\nthe biblical numbers. Why would these first three generations be immune to\\nwhatever reduced the years of their immediate descendants by half and more?\\nConsidering how Hebrews handled their genealogies provides the answer.\\nShem\\'s line is compressed. Many generations were born between Eber and\\nPeleg so those first three fathers died over a millennium before Peleg and\\nthe names that follow.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>18. Damage to the credibility of creation scientists. </strong>\\nCreation science is an admirable movement. In it are those who have risked\\nreputations and even careers as they point to scientific evidence that\\nsupports biblical creation and a global Flood. But a Flood date that is\\nlate by a thousand years or more is also associated with this movement and\\nunfortunately raises a question over the credibility of the science of\\ncreation scientists as well. By understanding how Hebrew genealogies work,\\nthose holding the late Flood date can correct their error and remove this\\nobstacle to the acceptance of creation science.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>19.</strong>\\n<strong>Non-biblical records about the first civilizations</strong>\\n. Scripture reveals that the Ark survivors and their descendants quickly\\nestablished an advanced civilization in Lower Mesopotamia. This makes sense\\nsince people who could build an Ark to today\\'s dimensional standards for\\nocean-going vessels, fill it with 15,000 kinds of animal pairs that needed\\na year\\'s worth of food and survive in it for over 365 days could certainly\\norganize an advanced civilization as seen in Babel and its tower. As to the\\nwhen of that advanced civilization, the ordeal of Job about 2550 BC\\ntestified that civilization already had a long history.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThese biblical facts are now confirmed in writing. In just the last 100\\nyears several million written documents have been unearthed in the Ancient\\nNear East at numerous locations. These tablets speak of their history and\\nof each other, confirming the existence of these many civilization centers\\nbeyond doubt. They also attest to the first civilizations. Where? You\\nguessed it-in Lower Mesopotamia, precisely where Noah\\'s descendants first\\nmigrated and settled. <em>Hidden Beauty\\'s</em> finding of a 1300-1900 year\\ngap between Eber and Peleg places the Flood between 3800 and 4400 BC which\\nencompasses the early well-known civilizations in Mesopotamia and Egypt.\\nWhat about cave men? At the same time advanced civilizations were being\\nformed, settlers that migrated to regions where severe ice age conditions\\ndeveloped were reduced to hunting-gathering life styles and stone-age\\ntechnology as they struggled to survive. Advanced civilizations and\\nstone-age lifestyles existed simultaneously within 500-800 years after the\\nFlood.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>20. Solving complicated problems.</strong>\\nOnly in modern times has the problem of a Flood date that is too late been\\nwidely recognized. Numerous attempts have been made to solve it, all to no\\navail because highly complicated problems require the correct solution to\\nmany individual issues. Yet the central solution is often elegantly simple.\\nWith Luther the elegant but simple solution was <em>sola scriptura</em> but\\ngetting there required addressing 95 issues for starters. As to this\\nsolution-defying problem the Church faces, the elegant solution is so\\nsimple-35-55 missing generations between Eber and Peleg-but this is only\\nthe first of many books needed to tackle the many issues it raises.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>21. Credit to Creation Scientists.</strong>\\nMuch credit for the findings of this book should go to creation scientists.\\nOnly through their research has the violence of Noah\\'s Flood become\\napparent. This realization sparked the idea of distinguishing between the\\nimmediate longevity decline due to the Flood\\'s impact on the genetics of\\nman and the gradual decline between Eber and Peleg represented by just a\\nsingle generation.

Dates.</strong>\\nScripture itself provides the numbers to determine all but one of the six\\ndates above, the date when Solomon began building the Temple. Countless OT\\nscholars have debated that date to the point where 966 BC is generally\\naccepted as correct. However, Scripture only provides years, not years and\\nmonths, so the above dates going back from Solomon could each add up to six\\nmonths of difference. Otherwise, for those who subscribe to the inerrancy\\nof Scripture, the above dates are certain. These dates are then used to\\ncomplete a chronological history of the world back to Adam based on the\\nlists in Genesis five and eleven including the HB view of 35-55 missing\\ngenerations between Eber and Peleg. Tables B.1 and B.2 give the master\\ntimeline in both directions, from 966 BC to Adam and from Adam to 966 BC.    <strong></strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Numbering of Tables.</strong>\\nFollowing Appendix B are Tables that provide historical data associated\\nwith various chapters of <em>HB</em>. The Tables are numbered. The main\\nnumber is the chapter with which the Table is associated. Numbers after a\\ndecimal are sequential for material related to that chapter.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Length of Generations.</strong>\\nFollowing the Flood lifespans slowly decreased from 464 to 70. Adulthood\\nsimilarly decreased. The Tables use various measures for starting new\\ngenerations. Immediately after the Flood new generations started every 32\\nyears but by Judah\\'s day, they were starting at the age of 20. When\\nnecessary, a Table will tell the length of generations it is using.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Table Headings/Abbreviations</strong>\\n. Various methods are used to save space. Most are straight forward.\\nAbbreviations include: gen=generation(s); est=estimate; MG=Missing\\nGeneration; calc=calculation; Scr=Scripture.\\n</p>\\n<br clear=\"all\"/>\\n<p align=\"center\">\\n<a name=\"_Hlk94804410\">\\n    <strong>\\n        B.1 - Master Timeline (Working back from Solomon to Creation)\\n    </strong>\\n</a>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong><u>Scheme:</u></strong>\\nRow one contains a known date and event.

Bible</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Secular history records</strong>\\nthat Elam (forerunner of Southern Persia) conquered Ur sometime between\\n2150 and 1995. Elam burned its palace and enslaved its population, ending\\nthe greatest period in Ur\\'s history, the 100-year reign of the Third\\nDynasty. No end of artifacts reveals the achievements of the five kings of\\nthat dynasty. Then just years later, Elam itself was defeated. It would be\\n1500 years before Persia again dominated Southern Mesopotamia.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Secular history\\'s record</strong>\\nis vastly expanded by Scripture. Genesis 14 tells that Elam placed Sodom\\nand Gomorrah under tribute about six years before Abraham arrived in\\nCanaan. The passage even identifies eight kings and eight nations\\nassociated with that event. Thus, Elam not only conquered Ur but extended\\nits domination all the way up the Mesopotamian Valley and down the route to\\nEgypt as far as Sodom and Gomorrah.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWhile secular history offers a 155-year range of dates for Elam\\'s dominance\\nover Ur (2150-1995), the Bible dates Abraham\\'s birth at 2166 BC, thus\\nnarrowing the secular range of years to just a small window of time. As to\\nAbraham, God\\'s call to leave Ur spared him from death or slavery when Elam\\ninvaded Ur. Our view is that God called Abraham after he had fully mastered\\nUr\\'s advanced learning, when he was between 60 and 65 years of age, shortly\\nbefore Ur fell. This means Abraham lived just 10 or 15 years in Haran and\\nmost of his adult life in Ur.\\n</p>\\n<table width=\"664\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" border=\"0\">\\n<tbody>\\n    <tr>\\n

highly accurate chronology of Jacob (4.2) is possible because Scripture\\ngives so many specific events in his life. For comparison, by our count\\nScripture records 38 specific events or significant details in Isaac\\'s\\nlife. With Abraham 80 are found. For Jacob the number is 158. He lived 147\\nyears so that is the equivalent of an event or important detail per year.\\nFurther, the place where Jacob lived when many of these events happened is\\nknown. Finally, his age is recorded when some happened. Consequently, the\\nsequence of these events, his age when they occurred and the place where he\\nwas living at the time allows the assembling of a very reliable chronology.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nUndergirding this chronology are large time periods and specific dates\\nfound in Scripture. The time from the Exodus to the start of Solomon\\'s\\ntemple was 480 years (1446-966 BC). Jacob told Pharaoh he was 130, placing\\nhis birth at 2006 BC (1876+130). Jacob repeatedly stated he served Laban 20\\nyears. Further, Joseph was 17 when his brothers sold him into slavery and\\n39 when Jacob moved his family to Egypt.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSome events, however, must be dated from a chain of events. Determining\\nwhen Jacob left home to live with his uncle in Haran for 20 years is\\ncritical. That year is found by starting with his age when he moved to\\nEgypt (130), subtracting the 39 years to Joseph\\'s birth (130-39=91),\\nsubtracting the preceding ten years to the date of his marriage (91-10=81)\\nand subtracting the seven years of service to Laban for his wife (81-7=74).\\nThus, he was 74 when he left home.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nScripture does not give dates for some events such as Judah\\'s marriage or\\nthe violation of Dinah. Dinah and Joseph were born about the same time, so\\nthey were about three when Jacob returned to Canaan. To be violated, she\\nhad to be old enough to be desirable but young enough to be naive. Because\\nof all that happened next (her brothers murdered the men of Shechem,\\nplundered their households; then God told Jacob to journey to Bethel and\\nsettle there), we suggest she and Joseph were 15: they made it safely, put\\naway their idols, worshipped God and settled down.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nQuiet returned. Judah married a Canaanite, Joseph began dreaming and two\\nyears later at 17 was sold into slavery. Thinking he was killed by a wild\\nbeast, Jacob was crushed. He left Bethel for home (Mamre) and Rachel died\\nin childbirth along the way. Benjamin was born after Joseph was gone.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThis Table gives the years Jacob lived in six known locations. Most of the\\ndates are found from the very numbers in Scripture. He lived with his\\nparents until he stole the blessing from Esau and fled to Haran to live\\nwith his Uncle Laban. Scripture says multiple times that he lived with\\nLaban 20 years. Then he settled in Succoth and Shechem until Dinah was\\nviolated. Then Bethel, Mamre (Hebron) and finally Egypt. (Most commentaries\\noverlook his dwelling at Bethel.) How many years? Two make the numbers\\nwork.\\n</p>\\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" border=\"0\">\\n<tbody>\\n    <tr>\\n        <td width=\"264\" valign=\"bottom\">\\n            <p align=\"center\">\\n                <strong>Jacob\\'s Home</strong>\\n            </p>\\n        </td>\\n        <td width=\"120\" valign=\"bottom\">\\n            <p align=\"center\">\\n                <strong>Years</strong>\\n            </p>\\n        </td>\\n        <td width=\"126\" valign=\"bottom\">\\n            <p align=\"center\">\\n                <strong>Age</strong>\\n            </p>\\n        </td>\\n        <td width=\"142\" valign=\"bottom\">\\n            <p align=\"center\">\\n                <strong>Date(s)</strong>\\n            </p>\\n        </td>\\n    </tr>\\n    <tr>\\n        <td width=\"264\" valign=\"bottom\">\\n            <p>\\n                With Parents\\n            </p>\\n        </td>\\n        <td width=\"120\" valign=\"bottom\">\\n            <p align=\"center\">\\n                74\\n            </p>\\n        </td>\\n        <td width=\"126\" valign=\"bottom\">\\n            <p align=\"center\">\\n                1-74\\n            </p>\\n        </td>\\n        <td width=\"142\" valign=\"bottom\">\\n            <p align=\"center\">\\n                2006-1932\\n            </p>\\n        </td>\\n    </tr>\\n    <tr>\\n        <td width=\"264\" valign=\"bottom\">\\n            <p>\\n                With Laban-Haran\\n            </p>\\n        </td>\\n        <td width=\"120\" valign=\"bottom\">\\n            <p align=\"center\">\\n                20\\n            </p>\\n        </td>\\n        <td width=\"126\" valign=\"bottom\">\\n            <p align=\"center\">\\n                74-94\\n            </p>\\n        </td>\\n        <td width=\"142\" valign=\"bottom\">\\n            <p align=\"center\">\\n                1932-1912\\n            </p>\\n        </td>\\n    </tr>\\n    <tr>\\n        <td width=\"264\" valign=\"bottom\">\\n            <p>\\n                With Heathen-Succoth &amp;

After the three Patriarchs\\nmentioned in I Chronicles 1, chapter two begins with Judah, Perez, Hezron\\nand his three sons. I Chronicles 2:25-41 devote no less than 17 verses to\\nJerahmeel, Hezron\\'s oldest son. The list ends about 200 years after the\\nExodus. In the list are 16 consecutive generations that were born in Egypt.\\nSheshan owning a slave is the clue. It could only happen during that period\\nof the 430-year Egyptian sojourn when Semitic Hyksos invaders dominated\\nNorthern Egypt. This list is such a prize because it clearly shows that\\nAaron\\'s list and many others with just a few names for the 430 years in\\nEgypt were condensed.

High Priest of Israel</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p align=\"center\">\\n<strong>Estimated Number of Missing Generations: 11</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Scripture: </strong>\\nThe Bible repeatedly gives just four names for Aaron\\'s genealogy:\\nLevi-Kohath-Amram-Aaron. In three passages this sequence is stated, Exodus\\n6:16-20, Numbers 26:57-59, I Chronicles 6:1-3, and in a fourth it is\\ninferred (Numbers 3). Nowhere else in Scripture is Aaron\\'s genealogy\\nstated. Further, Scripture gives the number of years each of these fathers\\nlived and since these years are insufficient for the 430-year Egyptian\\nsojourn, Aaron\\'s genealogy is clearly abbreviated. Chapter one spells this\\nout in great detail while chapter six restates it in other ways. Levi was\\nthe tribal father; Kohath was the founder of the Kohathite clan within the\\ntribe of Levi; Amram was founder of a great family within the clan of\\nKohath. An estimated 8-12 generations are skipped between Amram and Aaron.\\nBeyond question Scripture abbreviates this list.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Headings</strong>\\n: <strong>Gen</strong>-Generation; <strong>Age</strong>-Age of the father\\nin the row above when he begat the <strong>Offspring </strong>to the right;    <strong>Calc</strong>-Numbers used to determine Year (father\\'s birth year\\nminus begetting years). <strong>Year</strong>-Year the offspring was born.\\nAll dates are BC. For sake of reference the move to Egypt and the Exodus\\nare included.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>New generations</strong>\\n: On average they started every 25 years after Jacob. It appears that the\\nLevitical line was more restrained so 28 years is used to start new\\ngenerations for this line. These averages will be adjusted through the\\ntables to conclude with revealed numbers such as the Exodus.\\n</p>\\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" border=\"1\">\\n<tbody>\\n    <tr>\\n

related in Numbers 16. God gave the\\noffice of the priesthood exclusively to Aaron and his descendants while He\\nappointed Moses as the leader of the nation. Korah worked up a following\\nchallenging the positions of both Aaron and Moses. In effect Korah disputed\\nGod\\'s authority. God dealt severely with him. The earth opened up and\\nswallowed Korah and all that he had. This controversy appears to have come\\nearly in the 40 wilderness years. After the year at Mount Sinai came the\\ncensus, then the spy event, then this questioning of God\\'s ordained\\ngovernment.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Korah\\'s Genealogy</strong>\\nfollows the pattern of Aaron\\'s so it strengthens the idea of abbreviated\\nregisters. It is found in Numbers 16:1 - \"Korah, the son of Izhar, son of\\nKohath, son of Levi\" (four names: Levi-Kohath-Izhar-Korah). Aaron\\'s list\\nalso contained just four names: Levi-Kohath-Amram-Aaron. Korah and Aaron\\nwere about the same age so like Aaron, his list condenses up to 16\\ngenerations into four. Both belonged to the tribe of Levi and clan of\\nKohath. But whereas Aaron descended from Amram, the first son of Kohath,\\nKorah descended from Izhar, Kohath\\'s second son. From Izhar the record\\nskipped down to Korah who was born about 350 years after Izhar\\'s birth,\\nthus omitting 8-12 generations.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Dating Izhar\\'s birth</strong>\\n. Table 6.02 continues the scheme established in Table 6.01 with regard to\\nnew generations and headings. Additionally, since Izhar was Kohath\\'s second\\nson and daughters must be factored into the family tree, by alternating the\\nbirth of sons and daughters and allowing two years between births, Izhar\\nwas born four years after his older brother Amram.\\n</p>\\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" border=\"1\">\\n<tbody>\\n    <tr>\\n        <td width=\"72\" valign=\"top\">\\n

13</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>The Dathan-Abiram Rebellion</strong>\\n. These men joined Korah (see Table 6.02) to challenge God\\'s appointed\\nleadership of Israel. They were most likely princes of the tribe of Reuben\\nand about the same age as Moses. Reuben was Jacob\\'s firstborn.\\nTraditionally, the firstborn was the leader of the family. Jacob\\'s family\\nhad grown to a population of several million. The Reubenites expected to\\nshare in the leadership of the nation. But due to moral failure, God set\\nReuben\\'s line aside and chose Moses, a Levite, to lead Israel at this time.\\n<a name=\"_Hlk95487501\">\\n    As with Korah, God caused the earth to open up and swallow them and\\n    their households.\\n</a>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Genealogy</strong>\\n. Their genealogies are carefully stated in Numbers 26:5-9 and follow the\\npattern of Aaron\\'s and Korah\\'s-tribe, clan, family and them, just four\\ngenerations. They were of the tribe of Reuben, clan of Pallau and family of\\nEliab. Then the record skips down to Dathan and Abiram who were born 350\\nyears after the birth of Eliab and were contemporaries of Moses. Yet\\nScripture calls them sons of Eliab. Obviously, it is using \"son\" in the\\nbroad sense of \"descendant.\" Just their family and tribe are stated in\\nNumbers 16:1 where the account of their rebellion is found.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Dating their births</strong>\\n. This page continues the heading scheme established in Table 6.01.\\nHowever, because it involves two biblically named individuals, two numbers\\nare assigned so there is a full count of condensed OT genealogies. As a\\nresult, only averages are used rather than accounting for multiple sons in\\nthe same family as Table 6.02 did. New generations begin every 25 years.\\n</p>\\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" border=\"1\">\\n<tbody>\\n    <tr>\\n        <td width=\"72\" valign=\"top\">\\n            <p

On</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p align=\"center\">\\n<strong>Estimated Number of Missing Generations: 14</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>On\\'s Rebellion</strong>\\n. On joined Korah, Dathan and Abiram (See Tables 6.02-6.04) to challenge\\nGod\\'s appointed leadership of Israel. Like Dathan and Abiram he was\\nprobably a prince of the tribe of Reuben and about the same age. Reuben was\\nJacob\\'s firstborn and the firstborn usually became the leader of his\\nfather\\'s family. Moses was a descendant of Levi, Jacob\\'s third son. Like\\nDathan and Abiram, On felt Moses had gone too far. Maybe Moses could lead\\nthe nation of Israel out of Egypt, but now leadership supplied by the tribe\\nof Reuben was in order. He, like the other rebels, had totally overlooked\\nthe fact that God chose the nation\\'s leader. In judgment God caused the\\nearth to open up and swallow him and all he had.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Genealogy</strong>\\n. Like Dathan and Abiram, On belonged to the tribe of Reuben. But while\\nScripture tells both the clan and family to which Dathan and Abiram\\nbelonged, it only tells On\\'s clan, that of Peleth/Pallau. His list of just\\none name between the tribal leader and himself distinguishes his list as\\nthe shortest on record, just one name to span the 400 years between Reuben\\nand himself.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Dating On\\'s birth</strong>\\n. Table 6.05 continues the scheme established in Table 6.01 with regard to\\nnew generations and headings.

Israel</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p align=\"center\">\\n<strong>Estimated Number of Missing Generations: 13</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Stealing from God</strong>\\n. Joshua chapter seven is devoted to Achan\\'s sin. God had commanded that\\nall the plunder from Israel\\'s first victory in the Promised Land be devoted\\nto destruction. Instead, a nobody named Achan kept some of the valuables.\\nIsrael lost the next battle. Why? Sin in the camp. The perpetrator was to\\nbe found and executed.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Method of Identification</strong>\\n. Achan acted in secret and hid what he took in his tent. How would the\\nguilty party be located? God said to use the organization of the nation.\\nThe tribes were to pass by and the LORD took the tribe of Judah by lot. The\\nclans of Judah passed by and the LORD took the clan of Zerah by lot. Then\\nthe households of Zerah passed by and the LORD took the household of Zabdi.\\nFinally, the men of Zabdi\\'s household passed by and the LORD took Achan by\\nlot. This event further confirms what <em>Hidden Beauty</em> has said about\\nIsrael being organized by tribes, clans and households (also designated as\\nFamilies).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Genealogy and Lifespan</strong>\\n. Several difficulties-Achan was unknown so his father\\'s name is added.\\nFurther, his tribal father (Judah) started two families, the second after\\nthe first had grown, so his son, Zerah represents two generations, not one.\\nBecause Achan had considerable possessions and his father was dead, he\\nwould have been approaching the age of 60. His crime was so grave that it\\nis singled out in the genealogies of I Chronicles 2:1-7 as well. Five names\\nare found in Achan\\'s register rather than four. Up to 13 generations are\\nomitted.\\n</p>\\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" border=\"1\">\\n<tbody>\\n    <tr>\\n        <td width=\"72\" valign=\"top\">\\n            <p

Daughters of Zelophehad</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p align=\"center\">\\n<strong>Estimated Number of Missing Generations: 12</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Request of Zelophehad\\'s Daughters.</strong>\\nA certain man died during the wilderness years leaving only daughters, no\\nsons. His daughters asked Moses permission to receive their father\\'s land\\ninheritance in order to perpetuate his name. God approved their request\\n(Numbers 27:1-11).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Genealogy</strong>\\n. This genealogy contains seven names, considerably more than typical four.\\nCovering 500 years it omits up to 12 generations. The three extra names are\\nadded for the following reasons: 1) Jacob adopted Joseph\\'s two sons, making\\nthem tribes so both Joseph and the right son must be named; 2) While no\\nhousehold founder is named, Joseph\\'s grandson Manasseh produced clans for\\nthe next two generations so they had to be distinguished; 3) Both the\\ngrandfather and father of the five daughters are named, most likely because\\nthese women were unknown and this was such an important legal precedent.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>New Generations and Headings</strong>\\n. Table 6.07 continues the scheme established in Table 6.01 for new\\ngenerations and headings. Because their father died in the wilderness, he\\nwould have been 20 or more at the time of the Exodus. The daughters fall\\nbetween the 12<sup>th</sup> and the 13<sup>th</sup> missing generations so\\nthe birthing ages of their forefathers are adjusted, placing their ages\\nfrom 33 to 23.\\n</p>\\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" border=\"1\">\\n<tbody>\\n    <tr>\\n        <td width=\"72\" valign=\"top\">\\n            <p align=\"center\">\\n

the descendants of Jacob, he highlighted\\noutstanding individuals in each tribe. But what could he write of the tribe\\nof Ephraim? It had divided the nation. Yet it did have two distinguished\\npeople whom he featured: Sheerah, a famous heroine given below (I\\nChronicles 7:20-24) and Joshua who succeeded Moses, given next (7:25-59).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Confusion. </strong>\\nThese two lists (Tables 6.08 and 6.09) are frequently confused because the\\nfather of the heroine was named after the tribal founder. Further, the\\nauthor did not have all the names. As a result, the names between the first\\nand second Ephraims are fitted into the lifetime of the first Ephraim and\\nsomehow the list concludes with the famous warrior Joshua. Sheerah\\'s list\\npresents eight generations (including Joseph, named earlier) before\\nskipping up to 11 generations, concluding with the second Ephraim and his\\nchildren, Ezer, Elead, Sheerah and

These verses recognize two\\noutstanding individuals in the tribe of Ephraim. Sheerah (vv20-24) and\\nJoshua (vv25-27). Not clearly seen in translations is that the record lists\\none line of Ephraim beginning in verse 20 and a second line from Ephraim\\nbeginning in verse 25.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Organization of I Chronicles 1-7</strong>\\n. Chapter one covers descent from Adam to Jacob. Chapters 2-3 documents the\\ndescent of the kings of Israel. Chapters 4-7 gives genealogical information\\nabout each of the tribes of Israel. The tribe of Ephraim data is found in\\n7:20-28. However, it has been misunderstood through the centuries because\\nthe same names were given to sons again and again. This list alone has the\\nsame name for multiple individuals. The careful expositor will understand\\nthis common Hebrew custom and distinguish various individuals with the same\\nname. When this is done with the Ephraim section, it will make sense.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Condensing. </strong>\\nIn Joshua\\'s genealogy up to 18 generations are condensed into 10. Two\\nhundred years went by from the birth of Ladan to the birth of Ammihud. This\\nindicates missing generations since that is considerably longer than the\\nlifespan of any known individual in this period of history. Like most\\nHebrew genealogies, that of Joshua is abbreviated.\\n</p>\\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" border=\"1\">\\n<tbody>\\n    <tr>\\n        <td width=\"72\" valign=\"top\">\\n

align=\"center\">\\n<strong>Estimated Number of Missing Generations: 10</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    Caleb, one of the two believing spies, was a national hero.\\n</strong>\\nHe was apparently so popular that it was unnecessary to give his line. But\\nbecause Scripture speaks of him often, his line can be pieced together with\\nmuch work. Two keys unlock his line: his daughter Achsah and his being\\nnamed after the famous third son of Hezron (I Chonicles 2:42-50). See also\\nchapter six.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Caleb and Achsah</strong>\\n. After a year at Mount Sinai Moses sent a leader from each tribe to spy\\nout Canaan. Caleb represented the tribe of Judah (Numbers 13:6) so his\\nforefathers must be found in the genealogies of Judah (I Chronicles 2).\\nAfter many verses on the descendants of Caleb, Scripture says \"and the\\ndaughter of Caleb was Achsah.\" Since only one person has the name \"Achsah\"\\nin the OT, this is the writer\\'s way of linking the Caleb at the beginning\\nof the Egyptian sojourn with his famous descendant, the believing spy\\nCaleb.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Placing Caleb</strong>\\n. Caleb is called a Kenizzite, ie, of the clan or family of Kenaz and\\nfifteen times he is called the son of Jephunneh. So Scripture names nine in\\nhis line: Judah-Judah\\'s first family-Perez-Hezron-Caleb #1 plus\\nKenaz-Jephunneh-Caleb #2 and Achsah. Since Achsah was born about 1425,\\nabout ten names are missing from this genealogy.\\n</p>\\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" border=\"1\">\\n<tbody>\\n    <tr>\\n        <td width=\"72\"

Five hundred years later it was\\nincorporated into the I Chronicles 2:1-15 list without change. Five hundred\\nyears after that it was included in Matthew 1:3-6 without change and Luke\\n3:31-33 with just one contested addition.<strong></strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Organization of list. </strong>\\nThe ten names are divided into three groups. Group one lived at the\\nbeginning of the Egyptian sojourn while the second lived at the time of the\\nExodus 400 years later. The final group lived toward the end of the 4\\n80-year period of the judges concluding with Solomon\\'s temple.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Organization of Table</strong>\\n. The purpose of the tables in chapter six, is to calculate the estimated\\nbirthdate of each generation, thus producing a historical chronology. While\\nour standard generation is 25 years, when Scripture provides more specific\\ninformation (identified in the David section of chapter six), that\\ninformation is used. The headings have been rearranged. On each line is an\\nindividual or event. Column one calculates his birthdate by copying from\\nthe line above his father\\'s birthdate and begetting age.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Headings. Year</strong>\\n=birth year of individual in the row. <strong>Gen</strong>=Generation.    <strong>Age</strong>=when person in the row fathers his heir. The official\\ngenealogy of David condenses about 31 generations into 10. Perez was born\\nabout 1876 BC while David was born over 800 years later.\\n</p>\\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" border=\"1\">\\n<tbody>\\n    <tr>\\n        <td width=\"114\"

But\\nnone of them was a descendant of Aaron so they were not priests.\\nNevertheless, they composed many of the Psalms and were so prominent in\\nworship at the Temple that they are better known than most of the priests\\nduring the Temple period.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Missing Generations</strong>\\n: Their lines follow the pattern of most earlier examples-each line names\\nthree consecutive generations beginning with the tribe (Levi). Then they\\nskip 8-12 generations before resuming with the Exodus generation. After\\nthat, each line lists different numbers of consecutive generations :\\nHeman\\'s line is complete, listing 19 generations; Aseph\\'s line lists 11\\ngenerations before skipping 7 and concludes with him; Ethan is complete for\\nten generations before skipping the next eight and concludes with him. For\\nsake of clarity, birth years are averages, not specific biblical dates. In\\nthis way the missing generations become obvious and add three more\\nexamples.\\n</p>\\n<table width=\"672\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" border=\"1\">\\n<tbody>\\n    <tr>\\n        <td

Four Appendix Tables provide carefully researched historical chronologies\\nthat undergird and affirm the preceding 16 examples of condensed\\ngenealogies. Each begins with Scriptural information and is supplemented\\nwith well-established secular history. The first two, found in Tables 3.1\\nand 4.1, provide significant historical data related to the time of the\\nPatriarchs. This table, Table 6.17, provides historical data related to\\nIsrael\\'s final years in Egypt and the Exodus while the next table, Table\\n6.18, provides historical data related to the period leading up to Solomon\\nand the construction of the Temple.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Below</strong>\\n. Column one locates Moses in the consecutive list of 18<sup>th</sup>\\nDynasty Egyptian pharaohs. While scholars have proposed various dynasties\\nduring which Moses could have lived, only the chronology of the 18    <sup>th</sup> Dynasty fits the biblical details about the birth of Moses,\\nhis family, his adoption by the daughter of Pharaoh, his 40 years in the\\nwilderness, the ten plagues and the Exodus.

All Israel\\nknew that the sons of the high priest were worthless men, blaspheming the\\nsacrifices and defiling the Tabernacle with fornication. A godly but barren\\nIsraelite woman prayed for a son and promised to give that son to the LORD.\\nGod answered her prayer with Samuel whom she delivered to the high priest\\nafter weaning. For the next 25 years Samuel ministered to the LORD. When\\nGod judged 98-year-old Eli and his two sons who were around 60 with death,\\nSamuel did not assume the position of high priest because while he was a\\nLevite, he was not a descendant of Aaron. Rather he trained the next\\ngenerations of Eli\\'s line to be faithful priests, while serving as Israel\\'s\\nlast judge and first prophet. He wrote the book of I Samuel, possibly other\\nportions of Scripture and was a model for David.

A similar grouping of names\\nand numbers in Genesis five have been used to continue earth history back\\nto Adam and Creation. Those names and numbers are examined in chapter seven\\nand organized in the tables to follow.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Missing names between Eber and Peleg.</strong>\\nThe numbers from Shem\\'s list are displayed in table form below. They\\nclearly reveal an enormous decline of longevity between Eber and Peleg,\\nvastly more than normal variations and it was permanent. How many missing\\nyears does this permanent decline of longevity represent? The answer is\\nfound by multiplying the average years in a generation by the number of\\nmissing generations. Those two necessary numbers are found in the next two\\ntables. They show that the average length of a generation was 31.5 years\\nand that 48 generations are missing. Hence, by this metric and without\\nfurther refinements, about 1500 years are missing, placing the Flood around\\n4000 BC.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Table Headings.</strong>\\n<strong>Count</strong>\\n=consecutive numbering of names in the biblical text;    <strong>Age #1</strong>-age of father when he died; <strong>Age #2</strong>\\n=age of his son when son died; <strong>Diff</strong>=the difference in the\\nlength of the father\\'s and son\\'s longevities for quick comparisons.    <strong>Age #3</strong>=Father\\'s age when \"son\" was

Generation</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Calculating the two missing critical numbers. </strong>\\nAs explained in the introduction to Table 7.1, the Scripture reveals that\\nPeleg lived 225 fewer years than Eber. Since 225 years is the biblical\\nrecord and no recorded individual after Peleg lived longer than he did,\\nthis 225-year decrease was permanent. But the big question is \"How many\\nyears does that 225-year decrease represent?\" Two numbers must be found\\nfrom the Shem list to answer this question. The first number is found in\\nthis Table and the second is found in Table 7.4.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Three Standards for Starting New Generations</strong>\\n:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n1). <strong>31.43 years</strong> per generation. This number is found by\\nadding the ages of the first seven fathers in Shem\\'s list when each had his\\nson and dividing by seven, so this figure is an exact representation of the\\ntext of Scripture. For purpose of simplification, this number is often\\nrounded to 31.5.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n2). <strong>33.33 years</strong> per generation. This number is provided\\nfor ease of use. It is a generalization and can be used as 3 generations\\nper 100 years. Example: if 48 generations are skipped between Eber and\\nPeleg, at 3 generations per 100 years, 3 goes into 48 16 times. Thus 1600\\nyears are omitted.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n3) <strong>25 years</strong> per generation. This number is used in Jacob\\'s\\nday when his sons were starting families early, even before the age of 20.\\nAs longevity decreased, the years to adulthood also decreased. When Israel\\nenlisted all 20-year-olds in its citizen army in the wilderness wanderings,\\nthis was because the age of adulthood had declined to 20.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    Reliability of 31.43 Years per Generation (observations from Table\\n    below):\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n1. Based on seven consecutive biblical fathers and their numbers.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n2. Shows an expected overall slight decline of years from generation to\\ngeneration.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n3. Overall, Shem\\'s list shows a modest range of birthing years: 29-35\\nyears.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n4. Average before the omission of generations: 33 years.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n5. Average after the omission of generations: 30.25 years\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n6. Conclusion #1 - The slight decline of longevity is obvious in the record\\nof Genesis 11.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n7. Conclusion #2-This 7-father average provides a strong number for the\\nlength of a generation at this time in history.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n8. 31.43 (or a rounded number) will be used to determine generations before\\nJacob\\'s sons.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Headings: </strong>\\nGen=Generation; Birthing Age=Father\\'s age at birth of first son;\\nBefore/After-birthing age of fathers before and

This material is explained on pages 127-128 and repeated\\nhere in table form for easy viewing. Dates are BC. Years for the first two\\nperiods are based on the view that 35-55 generations are omitted between\\nEber and Peleg in Shem\\'s genealogy (Genesis 11:10-26). Since the lifespans\\nof named individuals are taken from Scripture, they are reliable.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Headings/Abbreviations. </strong>\\nDecrease=decrease of lifespans between two consecutive generations;\\nincrease=increase of lifespans between two consecutive generations;\\naverage=the average lifespan within the period; gap=omitted names;\\ngen=generations; YPG=years per generation.\\n</p>\\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" border=\"0\">\\n<tbody>\\n    <tr>\\n        <td width=\"78\" valign=\"top\">\\n        </td>\\n        <td width=\"140\" valign=\"top\">\\n            <p>\\n                <strong>Person</strong>\\n            </p>\\n        </td>\\n        <td width=\"109\" valign=\"top\">\\n            <p align=\"center\">\\n                <strong>Lifespan</strong>\\n            </p>\\n        </td>\\n        <td width=\"109\" valign=\"top\">\\n            <p align=\"center\">\\n                <strong>Decrease</strong>\\n            </p>\\n        </td>\\n        <td width=\"109\" valign=\"top\">\\n            <p align=\"center\">\\n                <strong>Increase</strong>\\n            </p>\\n        </td>\\n        <td width=\"109\" valign=\"top\">\\n            <p align=\"center\">\\n                <strong>Average</strong>\\n            </p>\\n        </td>\\n    </tr>\\n    <tr>\\n        <td colspan=\"6\" width=\"652\" valign=\"bottom\">\\n            <p>\\n                <strong>\\n                    Period 1 -

More realistic is the decline from\\nJoseph to David. Joseph was born about 1915 BC while David was born about\\n1040, a 900-year period. Joseph lived 110 years while David lived 70 years\\nor 40 years fewer than Joseph. The longevity of those who lived and died\\nbefore the Flood did not change. 900 years was typical. After the Flood it\\nwas cut in half to 450 years. 38-58 generations later it had declined to\\n236 years, then 138 years, then 128 years. Joseph lived 110 years. Last of\\nall David lived 70 years. Psalm 90:10 tells us the typical lifespan of his\\nday was 70 years. Yes, the decline after the Flood is undeniable.\\n</p>\\n<p align=\"center\">\\n<strong>7.4 The Decline of Longevity in Shem\\'s Genealogy</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Overview</strong>\\n: Table 7.3 gave the broad picture of human longevity decline after the\\nFlood. This decline is reflected in Shem\\'s genealogy, but it is so brief\\nthat without the broader picture, it is mostly dismissed as too small of a\\nsampling to be acceptable. Thus, the broad picture is placed first,\\nverifying that this specific picture follows the pattern of the larger\\npicture and is therefore trustworthy.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Record of Declines.</strong>\\nFour helpful records are found in the first six names of the Shem list. In\\neach of the four records below the second name immediately follows the\\nfirst name so they are consecutive. The three records in the first table\\nare single generation records. These show declines of 5, 0 and 9 years. The\\nsecond table shows a two generation decline of nine years. Averages are\\nparamount. This gives an average generational decline of 4.5 years while\\nthe three records in the first table give an average generational decline\\nof 4.7 years. These similar numbers assure us of being on the right track.\\n</p>\\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" border=\"1\">\\n<tbody>\\n    <tr>\\n        <td colspan=\"2\" width=\"217\"

This is where interpreters get\\ntripped up. Unusual numbers are numbers that are considerably larger or\\nsmaller than the average. Examples: Nahor\\'s shorter lifespan; four fathers\\nstarting families late (Terah, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob); the two who lived\\nboth before and after the Flood (Noah and Shem); the one generation\\nincrease between Shelah and Eber; and the precipitous decline of lifespans\\nbetween Eber and Peleg. Chapter seven explains that the shorter life of\\nNahor is inconsistent with the overall record and must be rejected as an\\nanomaly, such as an untimely death. The longer years of Eber are, of\\ncourse, true, but <em>HB</em> suggests was due to less stress than those\\nreestablishing life right after the Flood.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Missing Years between Eber and Peleg. </strong>\\nTable 7.2 and this Table have provided the raw numbers required to\\ndetermine how many years are missing between Eber and Peleg. Table 7.2\\nfound that the average generation at the time was 31.43 years. This table\\nfinds that the generational decline was 4.5 to 4.7 years. The next Table\\nwill use these numbers to find how many years are missing between Eber and\\nPeleg and thus the date of the Flood.\\n</p>\\n<br clear=\"all\"/>\\n<p align=\"center\">\\n<a name=\"_Hlk97393599\"><strong>7.5 Flood Date Estimates</strong></a>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Missing Years</strong>\\n. Finally, the big question can be answered. The date of the Flood ranges\\nfrom 3600 to 4300 BC because of many variables described in chapter seven.\\nBelow are tables containing the data on which this range is based. While\\nGod gave much information so that a reasonable date could be established\\nfor the Flood, Deuteronomy 29:29 applies.

Texts</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Introduction. </strong>\\nChapter 8 acknowledges that many Christians in the West do not know that\\ntheir Old Testament Pentateuch is but one of three existing OT Pentateuchs.\\nGermaine to <em>HB</em> are the numbers in the genealogies of Adam and\\nSeth. Each text has some different numbers so the numbers from the three\\ntexts are set side by side for easy study.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Abbreviations for the three texts</strong>\\n. LXX-Septuagint; MT-Masoretic Text; SP-Samaritan Pentateuch. The \"match\"\\ncolumn codes the amount of agreement on each number in the three middle\\ncolumns. BA stands for column two, the begetting age of each Patriarch; RY\\nstands for the remaining years until the Patriarch died; TL refers to\\ncolumn 4, the total life span of the Patriarch.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Match. </strong>\\nColumn five indicates which of the three texts agree on the numbers in\\ncolumns two-four. Numbers 5-1 are codes: 5-all three of the text agree;\\n4-LXX and MT agree; 3-LXX and SP agree; 2-MT and SP agree; 1-each text\\ncontains different numbers. Scripture itself gives The Remaining Years in\\nAdam\\'s list while HB calculates that number in the Table below. In as much\\nas the three texts contain 146 numbers, the issue is complicated.    <em>HB</em> takes the view that the Masoretic Text contains the correct\\nnumbers.\\n</p>\\n<table width=\"683\"

This table\\ntakes those numbers to the next step by both showing them and adding them\\nto give the various number of years from several significant points in\\nhistory like the number of years from Creation to Christ. Past chronologies\\nwere flawed because of numerous misinterpretations of the OT text. Two of\\nthe most obvious was a 215-year sojourn in Egypt and Terah being 70 when he\\nfathered Abraham. The numbers below reflect a 430-year Egyptian sojourn and\\nTerah being 130 when he fathered Abraham. The numbers below include two\\nCanaans but no missing generations.

(LXX)</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nJosephus devotes some 6000 words to the origin of the LXX in his work    <em>The Antiquities of the Jews</em> (<em>Ant</em>., 12/2, 287-292). It is\\na fascinating story that held and delighted his audience. That many words\\nwould produce an article about 18-pages long.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWhile the writings of Josephus were immensely popular in the Greco-Roman\\nworld of his day and after, he was branded a traitor by Jewish officials\\nwho forbid Jews to read or translate his works. This is understandable for\\nhe was born into a prominent Jewish family in Jerusalem. In the rebellion\\nagainst Rome, he served as a Jewish General in the Galilee. Then he was\\ncaptured, but instead of being executed, he talked his way into Roman\\nfavor, even advising them on military strategy in the destruction of\\nJerusalem. He ended up becoming a Roman citizen and received patronage from\\nthe Roman Flavian dynasty whose name he took. It is no wonder that his own\\ncountry hated him so.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe Jews told a different story for the origin of the LXX. According to\\ntheir account Egypt contained a large number of Greek speaking Jews who\\ncould no longer read their Hebrew Torah, so about 280 BC the LXX was\\ntranslated for them by 70 Jewish translators. Their date is 30 years\\nearlier than the date Josephus gave. Could the purpose of this second\\naccount be aimed at diminishing Josephus\\' appeal to Jews? Regardless, the\\nLXX stands dated to both 280 and 250 BC depending on which account is\\nconsidered correct.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nMajor difficulties face the 280 BC view. The Koine (common) Greek language\\nwas new to Egypt. It was only spoken in Macedonia until Alexander the Great\\nspread it through his conquests. Jews living in Egypt would have spoken\\npossibly an Egyptian language and a Jewish language but not Alexander\\'s\\nGreek that early . While he conquered Egypt in 332 BC, his successors\\nfought continually to establish Greek rule over that part of his empire.\\nPtolemy II Philadelphus who followed his father\\'s 40-year rule was still\\nquelling rebellions in Palestine and importing Jewish slaves after 280 BC\\nas his father had done before him.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nOver time these Jewish slaves increased in number and learned a measure of\\ntheir masters\\' Greek language, but they had not reached such a population,\\nproficiency in Greek or even the freedom to own books and read as early as\\n280 BC. Further, 280 BC was a time of struggles, not peace. A gathering of\\n70 Jewish scholars to translate the Torah required peace, not turmoil.\\nFinally, as suggested above, the Jews\\' hatred of Josephus could well\\nexplain the rival account of the LXX\\'s origin.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nCreationists who favor the LXX numbers prefer the 280 BC date which means\\nthey view Josephus\\' story as pure fiction. Yet the same creationists\\npresent Josephus as the strongest historical testimony to the LXX numbers.\\nIf he fabricated a tale about the origin of the LXX, can his numbers for\\nGenesis five and eleven be creditable? Declaring he made up his story of\\nthe origin of the LXX does not fit the facts.\\n</p>\\n<br clear=\"all\"/>\\n<p align=\"center\">\\n<strong>8.4 - Description of the Dead Sea Scrolls</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe DSS almost defy description, they are so varied. DSS authority Geza\\nVermes wrote his first edition of    <em>The Complete Dead Sea Scrolls in English </em>in 1962. The 2004 Penguin\\nClassics revised edition (about the 6<sup>th</sup> edition) covers 694\\npages of fine print and only includes the non-biblical scrolls. Vermes\\ndivided these scrolls by subject matter-the rules, hymns and poems,\\ncalendars, liturgies and prayers, historical and apocalyptic works, wisdom\\nliterature, bible interpretations, biblically based apocryphal works and\\nmiscellaneous. Thus, their literature went far beyond the books of the Old\\nTestament. Hershel Shanks, founder and long-time editor of Biblical\\nArchaeology Review had this to say about the non-biblical documents:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    While the Biblical scrolls reveal important insights about the\\n    formation and variations of the Hebrew Bible, the non-biblical scrolls\\n    have opened up whole new worlds of study and shed light on the rich\\n    variety of thought within Judaism at the end of the Second Temple\\nperiod.        <a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\" title=\"\"><strong>[1]</strong></a>\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIt is exciting to hear that over 200 ancient scrolls (plus many, many\\nfragments) were recovered that contain verses from every book of the Hebrew\\nOT except Esther. But the materials are far from 200 complete OT books.\\nJust one is a complete book (Isaiah) while another scroll contains half of\\nthe book of Isaiah. One of the best preserved biblical scrolls is the Great\\nPsalms Scroll. It contains 48 psalms including seven non-biblical Psalms\\n(not found in the MT). However, the average scroll is just a fraction of an\\nOT book. Cave number four contained over half of the scrolls yet all were\\nin tiny fragments, covered with up to a meter of debris and some even\\nchewed by rodents.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAmong the non-biblical scrolls are commentaries on Isaiah, Psalms, Hosea,\\nMicah, Zephaniah and Song of Solomon. Scrolls called apocryphon (singular\\nfor \"apocrypha\") expand on or rewrite biblical books. In this category are\\nthe <em>Genesis Apocryphon</em>, the <em>Moses Apocryphon</em>, the    <em>David Apocryphon</em> and the <em>Pentateuch Apocryphon</em>. Scholars\\nespecially appreciated the calendar scrolls which give astronomical\\nobservations and therefore can be identified with exact dates.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAmong the non-biblical writings are portions from just three of the common\\napocryphal books--<em>Tobit</em>, <em>Ecclesiasticus</em> (Sirach) and the<em>Epistle of Jeremiah </em>while the well-known Pseudopigrapha books of    <em>Jubilees</em> and <em>Enoch</em> are well represented. The\\nPseudopigrapha is a category of fictional religious literature that uses a\\nfamous name to get a reading. Lesser known and unknown books of this nature\\nfound at Qumran include the <em>Book of Noah</em>,<em>Book of Mysteries</em>, <em>Testimony of Naphtali</em>,<em>Prayer of Nabonidus</em>, <em>List of False Prophets</em>,<em>Prayer of Enosh</em>, <em>Pseudo-Ezekiel</em>,<em>Prophecy of Joshua</em>, <em>Birth of Noah</em>,    <em>Testimony of Levi</em> and <em>Visions of Amram</em>.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe <em>Book of Enoch</em> (I Enoch) is a collection of texts dating 350 -\\n0 BC telling of the rebellion of angels who mated with human women that\\nbegan a race of giants who devastated the earth and whose demonic spirits\\ncontinued to produce sin and misery. It further tells of Enoch\\'s\\ntranslation to heaven where he learned the secrets of the universe and of\\nthe coming judgment. He transmitted these revelations to Methuselah. Enoch\\nwas composed in Aramaic, translated into Greek and then into ancient\\nEthiopic. And so the list goes.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe researchers gave each document a reference code, a name and a\\nsimplified code. The simplified code began with the number of the cave in\\nwhich the writing was found, followed by the letter \"Q\" [for Qumran, the\\nsettlement near the caves] and finally a sequential number for that\\ndocument. Document 1Q1 was found in Qumran cave number one and is the first\\nnumber assigned in that cave. This document contains about 22 selected\\nverses written in Hebrew from Genesis chapters 1, 3 and 22-24. Document\\n1Q72, the last parchment found in Qumran cave number one, contains nine\\nverses from the book of Daniel.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe fragments from each cave were cleaned and placed under glass. One\\nauthority said that fitting them together was like working a jigsaw puzzle\\nwith 90% of the pieces missing. As pieces were assembled, OT scholars began\\nanalyzing them. Having spent a lifetime with biblical texts in various\\nancient languages, they knew the unique differences of individual verses.\\nPieces resembling the Masoretic text were labeled \"proto-Masoretic\" while\\npieces resembling the Septuagint were labeled \"proto-Septuagint.\" A third\\ncategory was labeled \"proto-Samaritan Pentateuch,\" a fourth \"free-style\\nscrolls\" and a fifth \"miscellaneous.\" Through this sorting it became\\napparent that most scribes through the centuries had carefully copied\\nexisting documents to the point where the biblical scrolls maintained their\\nintegrity. There was no large scale changing of sacred texts, at least\\nafter 250 BC when Genesis was translated into Greek.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>The Mysterious Sectarian Texts</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe documents to receive the most attention were the never-before seen\\nnon-biblical sectarian writings. The sectarian scrolls are a collection of\\nideas requiring a certain life style which is thought to have been\\npracticed at Qumran. These texts opposed the Jewish authorities who\\ncontrolled the Jerusalem Temple, observed a different calendar than the\\nTemple and involved a strong apocalyptic element. One prescribes stricter\\npurity rules than those of the Temple. Rules dictated the community\\'s day,\\nrising at a certain hour, beginning the day with prayer, then a long\\nmorning of work, concluding with ritual washing, dressing in special\\ngarments, eating the main meal, more liturgy and prayer, etc. The slightest\\nviolation of rules brought severe discipline.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe following scrolls provided the core of sectarian thinking: the    <em> Community Rule</em> is a basic code of sectarian existence reflecting\\nthe celibate life and common ownership. The<em> Temple Scroll</em> (longest\\nDSS-over 28\\' long and preserved almost to its entirety) is one of the most\\nimportant. Found in Cave #2 in 1956, it was the last scroll of the original\\nbatch to be discovered. It is a legal scroll, containing a rewriting of\\nPentateuchal passages, applying its laws to its readers who are to live as\\na community. It was written in the first person style of Deuteronomy (God\\nspeaking directly to His people). The<em> War Scroll</em> is a militaristic\\ndocument about the ultimate battle between the Sons of Light and the Sons\\nof Darkness. The <em>Genesis Apocryphon</em> is a rewrite and expansion of\\nthe book of Genesis. The <em>Damascus Document</em> and<em>Habakkuk Commentary</em> complement the <em>Community Rule</em>. The    <em>Thanksgiving Hymns</em> contain special prayers and hymns. These were\\nfound in better condition than most of the other scrolls.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAccording to the <em>Community Rule</em> the supervisor evaluated members\\nannually. Promotion meant sitting in a higher seat at the main meal for the\\nnext year. Demotion meant taking a lower seat. The standing of each member\\nof the community was obvious. Those who remained in the lowest seats were\\nin danger of being banished from the community which could lead to death\\nbecause of the oath they had taken.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nGeza Vermes well stated the thinking of the scholars of his day about the\\nsectarian scrolls when he wrote\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    The principal novelty provided by the manuscripts consists of cryptic\\n    allusions to the historical origins of the community, launched by a\\n    priest called the Teacher of Righteousness, who was persecuted by a\\n    Jewish ruler designated as the Wicked Priest. The Teacher and his\\n    followers were compelled to withdraw into the desert where they awaited\\n    the impending manifestation of God\\'s triumph over evil and darkness in\\n    the end of days&#8230;.\\n</strong>\\n<a href=\"#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\" title=\"\">[2]</a>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe sectarian scrolls used unique terminology to describe the special\\ntheology, worldview and history of the group which called itself the Yahad\\n(community). In earlier years researchers believed the community was Qumran\\nand that these documents guided life at Qumran. However, after years of\\nreflection the thinking has somewhat changed as the following quote shows.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    Most now agree that the corpus represents the writings of related,\\n    evolving communities rather than a single sect. Even the texts labeled\\n    as sectarian were likely to have been composed by multiple groups,\\n    within and outside of the Community. Three of the original seven\\n    scrolls found in Cave 1 near Qumran were instrumental in identifying\\n    sectarian texts and remain some of the most well-known manuscripts: The\\n    Community Rule (Serekh HaYahad), The Scroll of the War of the Sons of\\n    Light Against the Sons of Darkness, and The Habakkuk Commentary (Pesher\\n    Habakkuk).\\n</strong>\\n<a href=\"#_ftn3\" name=\"_ftnref3\" title=\"\">[3]</a>\\n</p>\\n<strong>\\n<br clear=\"all\"/>\\n</strong>\\n<p>\\n<strong> </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p align=\"center\">\\n<strong>8.5 Qumran: The Community that Treasured the DSS</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe identity of the Qumranians has been slow to gel because the scribes of\\nthe DSS and the occupants at Qumran are shrouded in mystery. Further,\\nexcavations of the ruins have not provided satisfactory answers. The first\\narchaeologist to excavate the site did the most field work. To the chagrin\\nof more recent archaeologists, he died in 1975 not having published his\\nresearch and those responsible for it still had not released it 22 years\\nlater. In the summer of 1997 Hershel Shanks, editor of Biblical Archaeology\\nReview, met with four field archaeologists to discuss the Qumran site. In\\nthe Jan/Feb 1998 issue of BAR Shanks reported on the discussion. He\\nreferred to his guests as \"four prominent archaeologists who know as much\\nabout Qumran and its excavation as can be known today.\" The archaeologists\\ndisagreed on many questions but one they all agreed on was that the\\noccupants of Qumran at the time of the scrolls were Jews. They listed four\\nreasons: Hebrew inscriptions on pottery called ostraca, many ritual baths\\nnext to the two large reservoirs, numerous stone vessels (which are always\\nclean whereas clay vessels can be unclean) and the nearness of Jerusalem.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBut in the early years as scholars debated the identity of the occupants\\nmany opinions were expressed. The cemetery at the site with over 1100\\ngraves was a puzzle. Some scholars said the settlement had nothing to do\\nwith the caves and scrolls. Instead, they explained that when it became\\nobvious that the Romans would defeat the Jews near the end of the\\nJewish-Roman War (66-70 AD), Jews from across the country brought their\\nprecious scrolls to this area and hid them in the caves. As to the\\nsettlement, they point to the fine clay collected by the water system along\\nwith the finding of much pottery and maintain it was a pottery factory.\\nOthers said that because of early archaeological discoveries, it was a\\ntannery or a perfume making facility or a military outpost or a winter\\nvilla of a wealthy Jewish family living in Jerusalem.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBut the majority of scholars observed that cave number four that contained\\nover half of all the scrolls was just a stone\\'s throw from the compact\\nQumran buildings, conclusively linking the settlement with this ideal place\\nto store their precious scrolls. Five inkwells were found in the ruins, far\\nmore than at any other archaeological site in Israel. Many inkwells speak\\nof much scribal activity. While over 200 scrolls were copies of Old\\nTestament books, three times as many were non-biblical sacred books and\\nhandbooks for the function of a religious sect. Somewhere there had to be\\nleaders who taught those highly detailed religious practices and disciples\\nwho kept them. The place would have been the settlement immediately below\\ncave number four that wrote and copied those religious obligations.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBeing self-reliant they would have made their own pottery and maybe even\\nsold some for income. Twelve hundred pottery place settings were found in a\\nstorage room near the kitchen. Nearby was the largest of the rooms. It\\ncould seat 150-200 for a meal. To be constantly producing scrolls would\\nrequire a steady tannery output, hence the tannery association. Their\\nsacrifices involved incense, hence the perfume association. Lastly, the\\nlarge cemetery and location suggested the site may have been a military\\noutpost at an earlier time. But the archaeologists were adamant that Qumran\\nwas not a military fortress at the time of the scrolls. Military fortresses\\nsuch as the Hasmonean and Herodian fortresses on Israel\\'s east border are\\nwell known. They had features such as one entrance and a courtyard large\\nenough to assemble the troops. Qumran did not have these features. Rather,\\nit had the features of a fortified agricultural settlement which are found\\nthroughout ancient Israel.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAll eleven caves were within a mile and a half of the compound. Most were\\non the faces of cliffs and were not easily accessed. Some were natural\\nwhile others were hand carved in soft stone below the hard rock that rises\\nto 3000\\' above sea level. A total of about 250 such caves have been\\nidentified in the region so there was nothing special to attract sightseers\\nto these inaccessible eleven. The dry desert air and dark caves preserved\\nthose documents for 2000 years. Following the vast document discovery at\\nQumran, letters and business documents have been found in caves at four\\nother Dead Sea locations.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Date(s) of Occupation</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe present thinking is that sometime after 100 BC religious Jews occupied\\nthis ancient site. It came to be called Qumran, a word associated with\\nholiness, and would eventually consist of a large square two-story building\\nwith a small central courtyard and a smaller building behind it. It\\nfeatured an intricate system for collecting and storing water. About 31 BC\\na powerful earthquake struck the area. The 7.0+ earthquake\\'s date and\\nstrength has been confirmed in the layers of mud at the bottom of the Dead\\nSea. Some say the earthquake left the site in ruins and that it was not\\nrebuilt until 30 years later. Others claim it was not damaged severely and\\nwas quickly repaired. The Romans put a final end to it about 70-72 AD.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe dates of occupation should not be confused with the dates of the\\nscrolls. Qumran procured existing documents, copied them and also produced\\nnew titles. The cost of an entire Bible (Old and New Testament) before the\\nprinting press was about the same as the cost of an above average home in\\nthe US today. Assuming that the Qumranians had limited resources, many of\\nthe documents they gathered would have been second hand. As the wealthy\\nwore out their copies of OT books and replaced them, the Qumranians\\npurchased these second-hand volumes. If so, the typical scroll they copied\\nfrom could have been one or two hundred years older than the date when they\\ncopied that scroll. Thus, they could have possessed copies of some OT books\\nthat dated to 300-250 BC. Such scrolls would have been 1200 years older\\nthan the Aleppo Codex (c. 920 AD) which was the earliest major Hebrew\\nscroll available to OT scholars before the DSS discovery.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Number of Occupants</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nEstimates of the number of occupants at Qumran run from 12 to 200. In\\naddition to the buildings, investigators have identified 20 hand-dug caves\\nin the marl of the plateau on which the site rests. Marl is a clay-like\\nmaterial, as hard as concrete when dry, but workable when moistened. The\\ncaves were large enough to hold two people and household items were found\\nin some. If Qumran was basically a copying center, the number of residents\\nwould have been low. But if it were both a copying and training center, the\\nnumber would have been high.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWhatever the number, certain primary functions can be identified.\\nObviously, there was the staff of scribes. If various similar religions\\ngroups shared in the use of Qumran, each scribe may have been part of a\\nteam that wrote new documents, obtained existing documents to copy,\\nprepared writing material (parchment) and ultimately copied texts. A\\nbuilding and grounds crew would be needed to maintain the facilities,\\nespecially the complicated water system which was apparently also used for\\nritual bathing. A food service crew would be essential, securing and\\npreparing the food, operating the dining hall and cleanup. The management\\nteam would supervise the members, oversee the finances, conduct daily\\nreligious services, train potential members (a two-year process) and manage\\nrelations with other like-minded communities. These considerations suggest\\nestimates ranging from 40 to 150.\\n<strong>\\n    <br clear=\"all\"/>\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p align=\"center\">\\n<strong>8.6 Were Qumranians Essenes?</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p align=\"center\">\\n<strong>Did Jesus Found the New Testament Church on Essene Ideas?</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWere the Qumranians Essenes and was the New Testament Church founded on\\nEssene Doctrines? Good grief! Another huge distortion to unpack. Just three\\nancient sources speak of the Essenes-Philo, Pliny the Elder and Josephus.\\nTheir writings have been used by some to argue that the Qumranians were\\nEssenes. Josephus wrote that there were three Jewish religious sects-the\\nPharisees, the Sadducees and the Essenes. The argument goes that since the\\nQumranians were obviously not Pharisees or Sadducees, they must have been\\nEssenes.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nJosephus was noted for simplifying his ideas for the sake of his audience.\\nHe would have lost them if he had mentioned the many other Jewish sects or\\nparties with religious views known from history such as the Zealots, the\\nSicarii, the Hellenes, the Therapeutiae, the Boethusians, the Herodians,\\nthe Hasidim, the Samaritans and the Christians. Beyond these were others we\\ndon\\'t even know about.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nRabbinic sources say there were 24 groups of heretics in Israel. Only the\\nuninformed or those who wish ill to historic Christianity would advance\\nthis Josephus three-sect argument. No writings that claim to be Essene have\\never been found. Never, anywhere in the DSS do the authors and copyists\\ncall themselves Essenes. No DSS even mentions them. Nevertheless, once a\\nnoted scholar suggested the Qumranians might be Essenes the idea stuck and\\nsoon the scholarly world was announcing, \"We now know about the Essenes.\\nThe Dead Sea Scrolls inform us about them.\" This is false reporting.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe first ancient writer who spoke of the Essenes, Philo, was a Jewish\\nphilosopher, born in Alexandria and lived about 60 years (20/10 BCE - 50/60\\nCE). His brother was the customs collector in Alexandria and reportedly one\\nof the wealthiest men in the world. Philo was thoroughly Hellenized,\\nspeaking highly of the gymnasium which righteous Jews abhorred. Philo\\'s\\ncomments about the Essenes mainly reflect the experiences and testimonies\\nof others so they generally are hearsay and to be taken with a grain of\\nsalt.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe second, Josephus, claims to have been in Essene training at the age of\\n17 but at the age of 20 he chose to be a Pharisee instead. Since Essene\\ntraining lasted three years, it is unlikely that he completed the program\\nand qualified to learn their secrets before he became disillusioned and\\nbegan to search for another affiliation. While he makes useful statements\\nabout them, the key statement that advocates for the Essenes identity is\\nfound in Pliny the Elder. This Roman historian wrote a ten-volume work\\ncalled <em>Natural History</em>. He lived 56 years and died in rescue\\nefforts during the eruptions of Mount Vesuvius (79 AD), so he was born\\n23/24 AD. While accompanying Titus in the Jewish Wars he came to visit and\\ndescribe the Eastern Mediterranean.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAfter explaining the western part of what is today modern Israel, Pliny\\nshifted east to the Dead Sea area, writing first of Jericho, then Engedi\\nand lastly of Masada. He did not mention Qumran which is located on a\\nprominence over a mile from the Northwest shoreline of the Dead Sea, about\\nnine miles south of Jericho or the three or four settlements found to the\\nsouth of Qumran because they were insignificant. He next speaks of Engedi\\nwhich was about 20 miles south of Qumran. Eight miles further south was the\\nlast holdout of the Jews, the rock called Masada. Masada marked the\\nsouthern border of Israel in the area at that time. Jericho, Engedi and\\nMasada were all major sites.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIn a long paragraph summarized below Pliny wrote that the home of the\\nEssenes was on the west side of the Dead Sea. Since Qumran was on the west\\nside of the Dead Sea, that statement is frequently cited to support the\\ncontention that the Qumranians were Essenes. But Pliny was more specific.\\nHe went on to say that their home was near Engedi. The Essene advocates\\nignore or explain away this more specific location stated here by Pliny:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nOn the west side of the Dead Sea, but out of range of the noxious\\nexhalations of the coast, is the solitary tribe of the Essenes&#8230;.\\nLying below the Essenes was formerly the town of Engedi&#8230;. Next comes\\nMasada, a fortress on a rock, itself also not far from the Dead Sea. This\\nis the limit of Judea.    <a href=\"#_ftn4\" name=\"_ftnref4\" title=\"\"><strong>[4]</strong></a>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAs you can see the ancient geographer actually told where along the west\\nside of the Dead Sea the Essenes lived. He wrote that below them was the\\ntown of Engedi. Those of the view that the scroll keepers at Qumran were\\nEssenes interpret \"below\" as directional, i.e., south of or downstream from\\ntheir home at Qumran was Engedi. This interpretation conflicts with the\\nrecord. One scholar searched the writings of Pliny and found that 15 of\\nPliny\\'s 17 uses of this phrase refer to elevation, not direction. Another\\nnoted Pliny did not locate the Essenes in a town but in an area so this\\ncould not refer to the compact settlement of Qumran. Yet another spent ten\\npages to show Pliny was referring to altitude rather than direction.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIf \"below\" refers to altitude, Pliny would be saying that Engedi was at a\\nlower elevation than the area occupied by the Essenes. This interpretation\\nnot only agrees with the overwhelming number of times Pliny used the\\nconstruction to refer to altitude, but also makes sense of his statement\\nabout their home being \"out of range of the noxious exhalations of the\\ncoast.\" By living somewhere above Engedi their drinking supply was not\\naffected by the unhealthy waters of the Dead Sea. We shortened Pliny\\'s\\nquote but he also stated that the Essenes\\' only company was palm trees. The\\nEngedi area was noted for its palm trees while Qumran was not.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Damage to Christianity from the Essene Identity</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSimply stated, Pliny\\'s quote does not support the idea that the scroll\\nkeepers at Qumran were Essenes. Nevertheless, on the basis of the known\\ncharacteristics of the Essenes and Pliny\\'s statement about the Essenes\\nliving on the west side of the Dead Sea, a majority of the scholarly\\ncommunity concluded and still maintains that the Qumranians were Essenes.\\nAmong the scholars were those who took the story to the next step,\\nspeculating that John the Baptist and Christ had gotten many of their ideas\\nfrom the Essenes at Qumran. According to this line of thinking Christianity\\nwas merely a product of man, built on the religious teachings of the\\nEssenes and, of course, Christ was merely the most recent prophet or\\nreformer mouthing these ideas. Journalistic sensationalists pounced on the\\nmost radical speculations of the DSS scholars. The public was learning\\nabout the Qumranians from these sensationalists who wrote things like \"the\\nearly church was rooted in the Jewish sect of the New Covenant, the Essenes\\nsect. It borrowed a large part of its organization, rites, doctrines,\\npatterns of thought and mystical/ethical ideas from the Essenes.\"\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe pulp sensationalists went so far as to suggest that those scholars\\nunder Christian orders (Catholics) and those with rabbinical training\\n(Jews) tended to ignore the problems the scrolls introduced. They concluded\\nthat their biases disqualified them from answering the question of who the\\nQumranians were. One highly influential journalist wrote that the DSS were\\na menace to rooted assumptions of tradition and dogma (ie, the Old\\nTestament Masoretic Text and the New Testament itself). He charged that\\nalmost without exception those of the Christian or Jewish faith have\\nboycotted the DSS.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nDr. William Sanford LaSor of Fuller Seminary wrote that these were serious\\ncharges, not just questioning the academic ability of these scholars but\\ntheir very integrity. More importantly, he stated that they were patently\\nuntrue. LaSor was responsible for the bibliography of DSS articles and\\nnoted that by 1954 at least 43 scholars of all persuasions had published\\narticles on the DSS and in the next few years many more would. Yet, the\\npulp sensationalists\\' articles attacking historic Christianity became the\\nextent of the public\\'s understanding of the authors of the DSS.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nDr. LaSor was asked to serve on a panel to discuss the Dead Sea Scrolls and\\nhe discovered that the entire auditorium of college students and even the\\nother panelists had only heard the sensationalists\\' side of the story-that\\nthe keepers of the DSS were Essenes and that John the Baptist and Christ\\nhad gotten their ideas from Qumran. One of the panelists was the dean of a\\nlaw school. Another was a prominent historical author. Subsequently,\\nProfessor LaSor wrote a 281-page book entitled    <em>The Dead Sea Scrolls and the New Testament</em> to show how far afield\\nsuch ideas were.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWhile both Essenes and Qumranians were ascetic, separatist, secretive and\\nlargely celibate, they also had major differences. Most differences involve\\ncomplicated intellectual arguments but here are some very clear but simple\\ndifferences. Qumranians required an oath for membership. Essenes disavowed\\noaths. Qumranians used oil in their sacrifices. Essenes believed oil\\ndefiled. The Sons of Light (Qumranians in the War Scroll) would fight the\\nsons of darkness. Essenes refused to engage in warfare. Qumranians required\\na two-year initiation process while Essenes required three. Beyond this\\nLaSor took up the major doctrines of the New Testament showing that in\\nevery case these two ascetic, separatist and legalistic orders had major\\ndifferences.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nHowever, even though the Qumranians were not Essenes, they were far from\\nthe teachings of Christ. Their sole objective was fully keeping the Law of\\nMoses. While they collected over 200 Old Testament scrolls, they acquired\\nor composed three times that many in their efforts to attain the\\nrighteousness required by the Law. This was their passion-to achieve the\\nholiness, the purity required by the Mosaic Law. To that end they separated\\nfrom what they considered apostate Judaism and adopted ascetic practices.\\nEven though John the Baptist ministered in the Lower Jordan River area not\\nfar from Qumran and Christ preached in towns close by, not a single\\nreference to the Baptist or to Christ, their teachings, New Testament books\\nor even quotes from New Testament books are found in their 700+ religious\\nbut non biblical scrolls.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe argument that the Qumranians were Essenes and therefore the DSS should\\nbe disregarded has failed.\\n</p>\\n<strong>\\n<br clear=\"all\"/>\\n</strong>\\n<p>\\n<strong> </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p align=\"center\">\\n<strong>8.7 - Weighing the LXX\\'s Textual Quality</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAs has been pointed out, the <em>LXX</em> and <em>MT</em> follow different\\ntextual families. As a result, scholars now are saying that much of the    <em>LXX</em> is an excellent translation of the base Hebrew texts that were\\nused. The translation began with the Torah in 250 BC. As many as four\\ngenerations of Jewish translators had their fingers in it between 250 and\\n100 BC until all of the OT books were included.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIn places the <em>LXX</em> is superior to the <em>MT</em>. We will speak of\\nfour. In I Samuel 11:1-2 the <em>MT</em> tells how the Ammonite King said\\nthat if the city surrendered, he would gouge out the right eye of each\\nmale. This seemed harsh for simply being defeated in warfare. The    <em>LXX</em> has an entire paragraph that is missing in the <em>MT</em>. It\\nexplains that Jabash-Giliad had rebelled, breaking a treaty with the\\nAmmonites and that the penalty for such duplicity was to gouge out the\\nright eye. In this case the MT scribe made an error called \"homeoteleuton\"\\nwherein the scribe\\'s eye looks away and comes back to the wrong place. In\\ndoing so he omitted an entire paragraph that explained this cruelty. This\\nparagraph was found in a Qumran manuscript and of course most of the\\nbiblical manuscripts at Qumran were in Hebrew. So the Hebrew text used for\\nthe <em>LXX</em> was right while the Hebrew text that became the    <em>MT</em> was wrong.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAnother example is Deuteronomy 32:8 which speaks about the dividing of the\\nland of the earth among all the nations. The <em>MT</em> says God divided\\nit among the \"sons of Israel\" while the <em>LXX</em> says He divided it\\namong the \"sons of God.\" Obviously, it was divided long before the birth of\\nJacob, the Jewish patriarch whose name was changed to Israel. The \"sons of\\nGod\" would be referring to the human race in the same way that Adam was a\\nson of God. Even the <em>ESV</em> which is translated from the <em>MT</em>\\nexplains this problem in a footnote but inserts the correct reading in the\\nverse.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nPsalm 145 is an acrostic Psalm. There are 22 letters in the Hebrew alphabet\\nand each verse starts with the next Hebrew letter. In the <em>MT</em> verse\\n13 starts with the Hebrew letter mem while the next verse skips the letter\\nnun and starts with the Hebrew letter samech. As a result, in the    <em>MT</em> there are only 21 verses in Psalm 145. The <em>LXX</em>,\\nhowever, contains the verse that starts with the missing letter so it\\ncontains 22 verses. Even though the verse is obviously missing due to a\\nscribal error, scribes after that faithfully copied the mistake. This shows\\nthe care with which they attempted to copy their sacred writings. [The    <em>ESV</em> also places the missing verse in the text while it explains\\nthe problem in a footnote.]\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIn a fascinating article Conrad Gren explains the most remarkable example\\nyet, that of Psalm 22:16.<a href=\"#_ftn5\" name=\"_ftnref5\" title=\"\">[5]</a>\\nThe <em>MT</em> reads \"like a lion my hands and my feet\" while the    <em>LXX</em> says \"they pierced my hands and my feet.\" Bedouins had\\ndiscovered a Hebrew scroll containing this psalm in the 1950\\'s but it was\\nnot examined by scholars until the 1990\\'s. This scroll was written in a\\nHerodian bookhand which dates it between 50 and 68 AD. It contains the\\nHebrew equivalent of the <em>LXX</em> reading \"they pierced my hands and my\\nfeet.\" The difference in Hebrew between \"like a lion\" and \"they pierced\" is\\njust one letter, the fourth and final letter of the two associated Hebrew\\nwords. The two Hebrew letters are similar in appearance. The first (a yod)\\nlooks somewhat like an apostrophe while the second (a waw/vav) starts as an\\napostrophe but has a tail that comes straight down. It would have been easy\\nfor a scribe to mistake the waw (vav), \"They pierced&#8230;\" for a yod\\n\"Like a lion&#8230;\", possibly due to failing light or a faded tail on the\\nwaw. [The <em>ESV</em> provides the correct reading in the verse.]\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWhenever this copying error occurred, it was not in the Hebrew textual\\nfamily used by the <em>LXX</em> translators, so the <em>LXX</em> preserved\\nthe correct text while the extant <em>MT</em> bears the copying error. We\\nhave cited four examples where the <em>LXX</em> contains the correct text\\nwhile the <em>MT</em> contains a scribal copying error. This does not mean\\nwe can\\'t trust the OT, but it does mean we need the work of textual\\nscholars to get it as close to the original writings as possible and that\\nthey need every possible tool including the <em>LXX</em>.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nOn the other hand, Scholars have noted many examples of errors in the    <em>LXX</em> such as the manipulated numbers in the genealogies of Adam and\\nShem, Methuselah dying 14 years after the Flood and leaving out 12% of the\\nbook of Jeremiah. One in which the <em>LXX</em> translators themselves took\\nliberties with the text involves the location of Abraham\\'s homeland. By the\\ntime of the <em>LXX</em> the location of Abraham\\'s homeland of Ur had been\\nlong forgotten, so the translators substituted \"land of the Chaldeans\" for\\n\"Ur of the Chaldeans\" in all four occurrences of this phrase (<em>LXX</em>\\n-Genesis 11:28, 31; 15:7; Nehemiah 9:7). This is called harmonization.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSince the historic land of the Chaldeans was Upper Mesopotamia, Ur was\\nidentified as the city of Urfa by many Bible commentators through the\\ncenturies. In this way the <em>LXX</em> translators introduced an error\\ninto Scripture. Urfa, recently renamed Sanliurfa, is about 25 miles\\nnorthwest of Haran. Both the Koran and the writings of Joseph Smith copy\\nthis error as the very word of God writing at length about Abraham in Urfa.\\nIn the 1920\\'s archaeologists identified the true Ur where Abraham grew up.\\nIt was not the dusty village of Urfa but possibly the leading city of\\nSouthern Mesopotamia in Abraham\\'s day, 700 miles southeast of Urfa and\\nHaran.\\n</p>\\n<strong>\\n<br clear=\"all\"/>\\n</strong>\\n<p align=\"center\">\\n<strong> </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p align=\"center\">\\n<strong>8.8 - The Extra Name in Shem\\'s Genealogy</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe DSS expose an error commonly repeated by creationists who defend the    <em>MT</em>. It has to do with a second Cainan in Luke\\'s genealogy of\\nChrist. Luke 3:35-38 reads:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>\\n    <sup>35</sup>\\n. . . the son of Eber, the son of Shelah, <sup>36</sup>        <u>the son of Cainan</u>, the son of Arphaxad, the son of Shem, the son\\n    of Noah, the son of Lamech, <sup>37</sup>the son of Methuselah, the son\\nof Enoch, the son of Jared, the son of Mahalaleel,        <u>the son of Cainan</u>, <sup>38</sup>the son of Enos, the son of\\n    Seth, the son of Adam, the son of God. (Underlining ours.)\\n</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe name \"Cainan\" that falls between Shelah and Arphaxad in the Gospel of\\nLuke is not found in the three pertinent <em>MT</em> genealogies (Genesis\\n10, Genesis 11 and I Chronicles 1) but it is found in the <em>LXX</em> of\\nboth Genesis chapter ten, Genesis chapter eleven and some copies of I\\nChronicles chapter one. <em>MT</em> defenders say this name entered the\\nGospel of Luke through a scribal error late in the third or fourth\\ncenturies. They say that as a scribe was copying the genealogies in Luke\\n3:36, after copying \"the son of Shelah,\" he looked down at the wrong line\\nand copied \"the son of Cainan\" from verse 37.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThat Cainan in v37 was actually the great grandson of Adam. Then the scribe\\ncontinued by correctly copying \"the son of Arphaxad\" and two lines later,\\nafter \"the son of Mahalaleel\" he copied the right Cainan into the text.\\nThus, the name \"Cainan\" appears twice in just two successive verses of Luke\\nchapter three, verses 36 and 37. They say this error occurred long after\\nLuke wrote his Gospel. They further say that this son of Arphaxad is never\\nmentioned in any Hebrew writing until long after Luke was written.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nApparently they have not heard about the Dead Sea Scrolls which speak often\\nof the other Cainan. Some 15 copies of the <em>Book of Jubilees</em> have\\nbeen found among the 900 scrolls and innumerable fragments at Qumran.\\nFifteen is more than the number of the manuscripts of most of the biblical\\nbooks and indicates that <em>Jubilees</em> was widely used at Qumran.    <em>Jubilees</em> devotes six verses to this Cainan, the son of Arphaxad\\nand father of Shelah. <em>Jubilees</em> is even considered canonical by the\\nEthiopian Orthodox Church and recognized by other Christian bodies as\\nbelonging to the class of sacred writings called the Pseudopigrapha. Never\\nmentioned in any Hebrew writing until long after the writing of Luke? How\\ncould they be so wrong?\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<em>Jubilees </em>\\nis something like a commentary on Genesis and Exodus up to the point where\\nGod appeared to Moses on Mount Sinai and supposedly gave the revelation it\\ncontains. It consists of 50 chapters of verse-by-verse elaboration and\\ndivides all time to that point into groups of 50 years or jubilees. This\\ncombination of numbers acknowledges God as the creator of time, the Lord of\\nall history. It expresses the belief that all human history is the story of\\nGod at work so all time belongs to God and is a record of His divine\\nactivity.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nJared Olar<a href=\"#_ftn6\" name=\"_ftnref6\" title=\"\">[6]</a> believes this\\nsecond Cainan was an original and authentic part of Genesis and I\\nChronicles. He makes a strong argument for this second Cainan being in\\nHebrew texts of the OT and this argument is hard to refute. He reasons that\\nsince <em>Jubilees</em> is like a commentary on Genesis, the Hebrew copy of\\nGenesis used by the author of <em>Jubilees</em> must have contained this\\nsecond Cainan (the biblical manuscripts at Qumran are mostly in Hebrew).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSince the <em>Book of Jubilees</em> is dated about 150 BC, this second\\nCainan was well known to the Qumran community from its beginning sometime\\nafter 100 BC. For this Cainan to have gotten into the <em>Septuagint</em>,\\nthe Hebrew text they used would have contained this Cainan in 250 BC.\\nClearly, to maintain that this second Cainan first showed up in the Gospel\\nof Luke in the third or fourth centuries AD is incorrect. In fact more than\\nhalf of the OT quotes found in the NT are from the Greek <em>LXX</em>, not\\nthe Hebrew <em>MT</em> and Luke\\'s list follows the <em>LXX</em>.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThis is so new to most of us that you may be thinking that you must be\\nmisunderstanding me, so I will restate the above: a certain Hebrew text\\nfamily contained this Cainan when the <em>LXX</em> translators began their\\nwork in 250 BC. They used that Hebrew text in translating Genesis 10 and 11\\ninto Greek. This explains how this second Cainan got into Genesis 10 and 11\\nof the <em>LXX</em>. But after translating the Pentateuch, the work on the    <em>LXX</em> proceeded by fits and starts over the next 150 years. It could\\nhave been as late as 100 BC before the translation of I Chronicles was\\ncompleted. By that time, maybe there was a difference of opinion by this\\nnewest generation of translators, so some copies of I Chronicles contained\\nthis Cainan and others did not. The author(s) of <em>Jubilees</em> followed\\nthe Hebrew text family that contained this Cainan as he (they) composed\\nJubilees. Luke simply copied this second Cainan into his genealogy of\\nChrist in Luke chapter three from that list in Genesis 11 of the    <em>LXX.</em>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWhy do later manuscripts lack this Cainan? Olar suggests that in the early\\nChristian era, a scribe accidentally omitted this second Cainan from the\\ntext he was copying at Genesis 10 or 11. Then later scribes were confused\\nwith the absence of \"Cainan\" in the one place and decided to omit it in the\\nother as well. As to Chronicles, since that had always been a mystery, it\\nwas not a difficult decision to omit it there as well.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nOlar suggests the following sequence of Cainan\\'s appearing and\\ndisappearing: This Cainan was in certain Hebrew texts of Genesis and\\npossibly I Chronicles before 250 BC. Demetrius, who lived about 200 BC,\\nspoke of this Cainan as well as Polyhistor who lived about the time of\\nChrist. While the writings of Demetrius have been lost, those of Polyhistor\\nexist and in speaking of this Cainan, Polyhistor said Demetrius spoke of\\nthis Cainan. <em>Jubilees</em> speaks of this Cainan. The Qumran community\\nwas taken up with the unique subject matter associated with this Cainan.\\nThe <em>LXX</em> speaks of this Cainan. All manuscripts of Luke but one\\nspeak of this Cainan.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThen some scribe accidentally omitted this Cainan and over time the other\\nreferences were removed. That explains why the earlier sources contain this\\nCainan while the later sources do not. Olar says that while it is possible\\nto explain how this Cainan eventually fell out of the text, he has never\\nheard a satisfactory explanation of how he could have showed up in the\\nthree different passages of the <em>LXX</em> translation between 250 and\\n100 BC by accident. As to the early Lukan manuscript that omits him,\\nscholars have discovered that it is not always reliable and therefore could\\nbe faulty at this point.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nEric Lyons writes for Apologetic Press and while apparently not aware of\\nOlar\\'s ideas, makes commendable observations on the overall problem which\\nis just below the surface-that some would use this situation to charge that\\nthe Bible contains errors. He points out that \"terms such as \\'father,\\' \\'the\\nson of\\' and \\'begot\\' occasionally have a much wider connotation in the Bible\\nthan might be implied when such words are used in modern English.\"    <a href=\"#_ftn7\" name=\"_ftnref7\" title=\"\">[7]</a> That is what <em>HB</em>\\nhas maintained for 300 pages.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nLyons speaks of the Pharisees who called Abraham \"our father\" in John 8:39\\nand Jacob who called Abraham \"my father\" in Genesis 32:9. He says the term\\nobviously means \"ancestor\" in these passages. He uses the example of the\\nfirst verse of the New Testament that we cited. There Matthew wrote \"Jesus\\nChrist, son of David, son of Abraham.\" Lyons says, \"Obviously Matthew knew\\nJesus was not an immediate son of either David or Abraham. Matthew simply\\nused them in the same flexible way that ancients used them.\"\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nLyons notes that Matthew intentionally omitted Joash, Amaziah and Azariah\\n(Matthew 1:6-16 compared with I Chronicles 3:11-12) and observes that if\\nthe gaps represented a legitimate discrepancy, \"the Jews would have brought\\nit to the attention of Christians 2000 years ago as they sought to\\ndiscredit Jesus\\' royal lineage.\" Then he shares this remarkable insight:\\n\"The simple fact is, just because one genealogy has more (or fewer) names\\nthan another genealogy does not mean that the two genealogies contradict\\none another. The controversy surrounding Luke 3:36 is readily explainable\\nwhen one considers the flexibility that the ancients employed in recording\\nthe names of \\'fathers\\' and \\'sons.\\'\" Lyons must be commended for this great\\ninsight. He goes on to state his preference for the later scribal omission\\nexplanation, but it is clear he had not seen the large body of information\\nabout the early knowledge of this Cainan given by Olar.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWe suggest there could be even more complex explanations for the growing\\ndisappearance of Cainan. The authorities in Jerusalem rejected the radical\\nteaching of groups like the Qumranian community. Possibly over time they\\nattempted to counter their teaching in any way they could. According to    <em>Jubilees</em> chapter eight the second Cainan searched too deeply into\\na forbidden subject-the mystery of fallen angels cohabiting with human\\nwomen in Genesis six. This subject also fascinated the Qumranians. Omitting\\nthe second Cainan from future copies of the Old Testament would be one\\nsmall step in countering their influence. So as the Pharisees commissioned\\nnew copies of the Old Testament, they could have made sure this Cainan was\\nleft out. This would all have been happening before the 70 AD destruction\\nof Jerusalem. Over time Christian scribes would come to be unsure about him\\nand begin to omit him as well.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSo to say that this second Cainan is never mentioned in early Hebrew is the\\nwrong answer. It could be that his inclusion in Luke was the result of a\\nscribal error. But it could be that the Holy Spirit guided Luke to include\\nit as Dr. Luke used the <em>LXX</em> which contained the second Cainan\\'s\\nname and that the author of the <em>MT</em> left his name out in order to\\nbalance the three names after the 35-55 generation omission between Eber\\nand Peleg with the three names before the 35-55 generation omission. We\\nwill find out in heaven, but meanwhile we must be careful not to use\\ndishonest arguments in our defense of the <em>MT</em>.\\n</p>\\n<br clear=\"all\"/>\\n<p align=\"center\">\\n<a name=\"_Hlk89022496\"><strong>8.9</strong></a>\\n<strong> Arguments from Symmetry and the Meaning of Names</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nA very different approach used by some creationists to determining whether\\nthe <em>LXX</em> or <em>MT</em> of Shem\\'s line is the correct reading is to\\nstudy the meaning of names. They observe that Cainan means \"smith, a forger\\nof metal\" and find that the oldest foundry in the world was located just\\nmiles northwest of Greater Ararat. They reason that metal would be needed\\nin the new world so this man born in the second generation following the\\nFlood pursued the vocation of producing metals. His settling close to where\\nsome say the ark landed is also used to argue that until the Ice Age waned\\nthe Ark survivors stayed in the vicinity of Ararat. These folks conclude\\nthat since the second Cainan\\'s name is found in the <em>LXX</em> list of\\nGenesis 11 but not in the <em>MT</em> text, the <em>LXX</em> text is the\\ncorrect text for this paragraph of Genesis.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBasing interpretations on the meaning of names is not an exact science.\\nThis kind of argument seizes on the name Peleg (division) to be referring\\nto the dividing of tongues judgment at the Tower of Babel. We previously\\nshowed that there were not enough workers to build the Tower and the city\\nby the time Peleg was born (if this list is complete). So they argue he got\\nhis name \"Peleg\" after he was grown. Those who argue that way say Cainan\\nalso got his name sometime after he developed his trade as an adult.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThis complex explanation for the second Cainan has a problem. The first\\nCainan (Kenan) was born in the fourth generation after creation, making him\\na great grandson of Adam. There is no record that he was a worker of metal.\\nRather, Scripture says that an eighth generation man named Tubal-cain was a\\n\"forger of all instruments of bronze and iron\" (Genesis 4:22). Even worse\\nAdam\\'s first son, Cain, also bears a name from the stem meaning \"smith.\"\\nYet Scripture tells us specifically that he \"was a worker of the ground\"\\n(Genesis 4:2), i.e., a farmer. Clearly, the explanation that the meaning of\\nthe post-Flood Cainan\\'s name informs us he met an early need after the\\nFlood by working with metal is speculative and cannot assure us that he\\ntruly was the son of Arpachshad.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThen some creationists use the argument from symmetry. In this case it can\\ngo either way: Unger speaks of ten names in Genesis 5 and ten names in\\nGenesis 11. His ten names are Adam to Noah in Genesis 5 and Shem to Abraham\\nin Genesis 11. But if the second Cainan belongs in the list beginning with\\nShem, the second group of ten names would be Shem to Terah. That is not a\\nproblem. This argument regarding symmetry appears sound. It is used to\\nargue that the two lists are tailored to ten names per list (which would\\nindicate that names were omitted).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe symmetry argument is also used for the inclusion of the second Cainan\\nin Luke\\'s list. That argument is fraught with difficulty. Luke\\'s list\\ncontains 78 names including that of God. Leaving out the name of God and\\nstarting with Adam, the symmetry argument suggests that there are seven\\ngroups of ten names and then a final group of seven names (10 x 7=70 + 7 =\\n77). The symbolism is found in the special numbers ten, seven and four. The\\nnumber four is found in the fact that each of the first four groups of ten\\nnames introduced a new beginning: Adam, the beginning of man; Shem, the\\nbeginning of population growth after the Flood; Abraham, the beginning of\\nGod\\'s chosen people; Sala (Salmon) the beginning of living in the Promised\\nLand. The difficulty is that name #28, Admin, in Luke\\'s list is a scribal\\ncopying error. Remove that name and Sala is the last name in the third\\ngroup of ten rather than the first name in the fourth group of ten. As a\\nresult, the symbolism of the number four is lost and the last group of\\nseven is short a name. Thus, while many arguments support the inclusion of\\nthe second Cainan in Luke\\'s list, this argument is not one of them.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe additional years in the <em>LXX</em> have appealed to some creationists\\nwho feel the Flood occurred well before 2348 BC. As a result, they have\\nadopted those numbers and even the arguments from names and symmetry as\\nevidence those numbers are correct. How much better is the hidden beauty of\\nHebrew genealogies as a more sure foundation to earlier dates.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nDr. Luke (Luke 3:23-38) provides the longest genealogical list in\\nScripture-78 names including the name of God. Luke carefully researched his\\nsubject and included every name he found in the historical records. Yet,\\nfor all his diligence, his list did not include the 35-55 generations\\nomitted between Eber and Peleg (Luke 3:35) or those omitted between Ram and\\nAmminadab (Luke 3:33) or those omitted between Sala and Boaz (Luke 3:32).\\nFor a fact, God did not supply him with the names of those skipped in the\\nearlier lists. Clearly, God Himself was not concerned with us having all\\nthose names. If that is God\\'s position, why should we make this such a\\nconcern?\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIn conclusion to the two Cainan issue, we have argued that the years given\\nin Shem\\'s line in the <em>LXX</em> seem contrived. Thus, we doubt that\\nthose numbers are reliable. However, it could be that the <em>LXX</em>\\'s\\ninclusion of the second Cainan is correct. Textual scholars seldom find\\nthat one entire passage of a text is totally correct, while another is\\ntotally incorrect. So this additional name could be correct while the\\nnumbers are incorrect. However, more evidence will be needed to settle the\\nissue beyond doubt. Since the appearance of the second Cainan in th    <em>e LXX </em>could well explain his appearance in the Gospel of Luke,\\nfurther evidence for inclusion in the one would, depending on its nature,\\nbe further evidence for inclusion in the other.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSo, why strain over differences such as the second Cainan being found in\\nthe <em>LXX</em> but not the <em>MT</em>? Maybe someday further textual\\nfindings will settle the issue one way or the other. But what is important\\nis that both Matthew and Luke achieved their objective-to show that Jesus\\nwas human and the descendant of David and Abraham thus fulfilling promises\\nGod made to them, even though an occasional scribal error may have crept\\ninto the text.\\n</p>\\n<br clear=\"all\"/>\\n<h3>\\n<a name=\"_Hlk77188247\">11.1 Fourteen Reasons for Dating Job Early</a>\\n</h3>\\n<p>\\n1. <strong>Job\\'s longevity</strong>. Job lived 280 years, 41 years longer\\nthan Peleg and 105 years longer than Abraham who was born about 2166 BC. If\\nShem\\'s list is complete following Peleg, Peleg was born about 2417 BC and\\nJob was born eight generations before or about 2700 BC.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n2. <strong>Names for God</strong>. The early name for God, Shaddai, found\\n41 times in the Bible, occurs 31 of those times in Job. God revealed\\nhimself to Abraham 500 years later as El Shaddai, Almighty God and to Moses\\n1200 years after Job as Jehovah, the eternally existing one.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n3. <strong>Ice age related weather</strong>. Job contains more such\\nreferences than possibly all the other books of the Bible put together. His\\nfirst 140 years paralleled the closing portion of the Great Ice Age. Both\\nthe climate and its effect on the earth underwent a great change by\\nAbraham\\'s day.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n4. <strong>Dinosaur-like creatures</strong>. They were still common in\\nJob\\'s day but not in Abraham\\'s day.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n5. <strong>Sound theology</strong>. A high view of the true God prevailed\\nthroughout Job\\'s area as witnessed by Job\\'s four counselors. It was lost by\\nthe days of Sodom and Gomorrah. Job contains no hint of idolatry, pagan\\npantheism or mythological exaggerations that characterized other ancient\\nwritings.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n6. <strong>Source of suffering</strong>. Mankind had not yet come to\\nrealize that Satan was a source of suffering and thought all suffering was\\npunishment for sin and was caused by God. This error blemished the\\ncharacter of God and needed to be snuffed out as early as possible.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n7. <strong>Message of Job</strong>. The major purpose of the book is to\\nidentify man\\'s most mortal enemy, Satan. This message was needed at the\\nearliest possible point in God\\'s revelation to man.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n8. <strong>Divine discourse on creation</strong>. In Job God speaks more of\\ncreation than all the rest of the Bible, even Genesis. Since the physical\\ncreation and God\\'s sustaining of it is the primary argument for the\\nexistence of God and His love for mankind, providing this material at the\\nearliest possible moment was critical.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n9. <strong>Land of Uz</strong>. Job lived in Uz which was named after the\\noldest son of Aram. Uz, born in the second generation after the Flood,\\nwould have established the land of Uz long before Job was born, but his\\ngodly influence extended all the way down to his descendant Job.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n10. <strong>Primeval history</strong>. Casual references to primeval\\nhistory-creation, the fall, the Flood, Babel-are mentioned as if they were\\nstill fresh in those people\\'s minds.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n11. <strong>Table of Nations</strong>. Job contains references to people\\nnamed in the Table of Nations (Genesis 10) rather than those who lived\\nafter Abraham entered Canaan: Uz (1:1), Sabeans (1:15), Chaldeans (1:17),\\nTemenites (2:11), Shuhuites (2:11), Naamathite (2:11), Buzites (32:2),\\nEthiopia (28:19), Sheba (6:19) but not Canaanites, Amorites, Amalakites,\\nIshmaelites, Midianites, Moabites, etc.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n12. <strong>Constellations</strong>. Job contains more references to\\nheavenly constellations than any other book in the Bible. Some commentators\\nsuggest certain constellations were the Bible of early man and associated\\nstories contained the essential theology God wanted man to know. Since the\\nFlood did not change the starry heavens, their message was the same both\\nbefore and after the Flood.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n13.<strong> Obvious omissions</strong>. No references to Abraham, Israel or\\nthe ten commandments.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n14.<strong> Animal sacrifice</strong>. Job begins and concludes with animal\\nsacrifice for sin which reaches back to Abel\\'s animal sacrifice which God\\naccepted and Cain\\'s fruit sacrifice which God rejected.\\n</p>\\n<h3>\\n16.1 Tower Builders Available 91 Years after the Flood (AF)\\n</h3>\\n<p align=\"center\">\\n(See chapter 16, pp 225-227 for details)\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n<strong>Available Workers</strong>\\n.
