For example, advanced societies thrived\\n    across the Near East when the numbers of Shem\\'s genealogy are used to\\n    determine the date of Noah\\'s Flood. There is no error in Scripture so we\\n    need to understand the method that the Jewish people used in compiling\\n    genealogies and read accordingly. With this help we can affirm the\\n    inerrancy of Biblical statements without denying the overwhelming testimony\\n    of historical studies.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Furthermore, if we understand the OT practice of condensing genealogies, we\\n    will not unnecessarily give people an excuse to attack the Bible as being\\n    unreliable. Therefore, such insight is very important. In fact, it is so\\n    important that we call those methods \"the hidden beauty of Hebrew\\n    genealogies.\" This hidden beauty focuses on identity in the family line,\\n    not necessarily the succession from father to son, and sometimes includes\\n    significant gaps. Such understanding harmonizes those words and numbers of\\n    the Old Testament often viewed as contradictions and clumsily\\n    reinterpreted.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The Executive Summary (pages 5-6) explains the conclusion of this book-that\\n    Shem\\'s genealogy of Genesis 11 omits 35-55 generations. This chapter\\n    introduces the first evidence for that conclusion. The Levi-Aaron list\\n    covers about 500 years which includes the 430-years Israel dwelt in Egypt.\\n    Yet it contains just four people (Levi-Kohath-Amram-Aaron). We are given\\n    much information about them, even their overlapping life spans which fail\\n    to bridge those 500 years. The list omits up to a dozen names.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    This position has not been the view of the church historically. The reason\\n    has to do with the number of years Israel sojourned in Egypt. Whether it\\n    was 215 or 430-years has been a continuing controversy for 2000 years. The\\n    preponderance of Scriptural evidence favors 430 but historical evidence\\n    supported 215. For instance, the Septuagint (i.e., the Greek translation of\\n    the Old Testament) says Israel sojourned in Canaan and Egypt 430-years.\\n    Early authorities like Josephus concurred. The church fathers added their\\n    \"Amen.\" Because the Hebrew text of the key passage, Exodus 12:40, had a\\n    problem, it could be understood to mean that 430-years was the total time\\n    in Canaan <strong>and</strong>Egypt. Events in the lives of Abraham and\\n    Jacob were then erroneously interpreted to support a 215-year Egyptian\\n    sojourn. As a result, the Levi-Aaron list was viewed as complete. To this\\n    day some still insist that Israel only sojourned in Egypt 215-years.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    While 430-years in Egypt only adds a few years to the antiquity of Noah\\'s\\n    Flood, an incomplete Levi list opens the door to other Old Testament\\n    genealogies being incomplete. An abbreviated Shem list could push the date\\n    for the Flood back hundreds or even thousands of years. To find the\\n    approximate time of the Flood, <em>Hidden Beauty</em> must address the many\\n    controversies that have clouded this question. In the process the book has\\n    become very long.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Before proceeding, it must be stated that foundational to this book is the\\n    doctrine of the inerrancy of Scripture, the biblical truth that God so\\n    moved its authors that they wrote His message without error. It applies to\\n    every word of the original writings. It means that all Scripture was\\n    originally in harmony with the original writings of all other\\n    Scripture-that no statement contradicted any other statement in its\\n    original writing. It also means that all Scripture is important, that every\\n    word is equally true, that no Scripture should be dismissed, overlooked or\\n    regarded as insignificant. The church has restated this doctrine at\\n    critical times in history. Most recently in the Fall of 1978 an\\n    international gathering of nearly 300 noted evangelical scholars produced\\n    \"The Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy\" which reaffirmed this truth\\n    in clear but precise terms. <a href=\"\" name=\"_ftnref1\" title=\"\"><sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup></a>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Because Scripture is God\\'s word, it is the final authority on every issue\\n    it addresses. In this book every effort is made to answer each issue solely\\n    on the basis of what the Bible itself says. After determining what\\n    Scripture says, the secular view of where and when advanced societies first\\n    developed will be discussed because surprisingly it supports what the Bible\\n    has said all along. Also, by way of introduction the following purpose and\\n    function of Hebrew genealogies must ever be in the minds of those who\\n    discuss them.\\n</p>\\n\\n    <h4 id=\"overview-of-hebrew-genealogies\">Overview of Hebrew Genealogies</h4>\\n\\n<p>\\n    Most peoples, and especially the West, have used genealogies and\\n    chronologies to display an unbroken list of immediate relationships such as\\n    father-son, rulers, priests, etc. In contrast, the basic idea of Hebrew\\n    genealogies was identity, not succession. Hebrews identified descendants\\n    with their forefathers and forefathers with their descendants. It could be\\n    boiled down to this: all descendants were in the loins of their forefathers\\n    and all forefathers were the fathers of their descendants. It was perfectly\\n    accurate in Hebrew usage to say B was the son of A or to say G was the son\\n    of A when actually generations B-F came between A and G.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    For example, Hebrew genealogies could be as specific as Adam knew Eve who\\n    conceived Cain (Genesis 4:1) or as broad as \"Jesus Christ, the son of\\n    David\" (Matthew 1:1). Cain was the immediate result of the union of Adam\\n    and Eve. There were no intermediate generations between the parents and\\n    their son. This is the narrow use in Hebrew thinking (A begat B). On the\\n    other hand, one thousand years separated David from his distant son Jesus\\n    Christ. This is the broad use of genealogies in Scripture (A begat G). The\\n    broad use could compact many generations into one, yet be perfectly\\n    truthful. The intentional skipping or omitting of names could be considered\\n    condensing or abbreviating. It was beautifully efficient and simple.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Matthew made no error when he wrote \"Jesus Christ, the son of David.\" His\\n    purpose was to identify Jesus Christ with David genealogically. Authors of\\n    Scripture determined the degree of completeness of a blood line, often\\n    providing only as many names as their purpose required. Those in the day of\\n    any particular author would discern whether his list was complete or not,\\n    but as time passed this discernment became more difficult. In time, even\\n    Bible scholars, misunderstanding this broader use of Hebrew genealogies,\\n    began to wrest the Scripture with their interpretations.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Condensing a Genealogical List-A Clear OT Example </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    A 215-year sojourn by Jacob and his descendants in Egypt is an essential\\n    element in the historic view that the Flood occurred about 2348 BC\\n    according to Archbishop James Ussher. His monumental work, <em>Annals of the World</em>, first published in Latin in\\n    1650, used the\\n    typical approach of working back from later known dates to Abraham. This\\n    method then added the years when each father in Shem\\'s genealogy of Genesis\\n    11 had his heir to finally reach the Flood date.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    A 430-year Egyptian sojourn adds a mere 215-years to this date. But\\n    recognizing a 430-year Egyptian sojourn introduces a game-changing\\n    precedent. It means that many names are omitted in Levi\\'s genealogy that\\n    appears to be complete. Since the Shem list has characteristics similar to\\n    the Levi-Aaron list, it opens the door to omitted names in that list which\\n    some vehemently deny.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    While many have been told that Scripture is confusing about the years\\n    Israel spent in Egypt, the next chapter will show that no less than God\\n    Himself witnessed to a 430-year sojourn there. But that is not all. Moses\\n    likewise witnessed to 430-years in Egypt. Then over a millennium later\\n    Stephen affirmed God\\'s word and Paul affirmed Moses\\' word. On the other\\n    hand, nowhere does Scripture state that Israel sojourned in Egypt\\n    215-years. Nowhere!\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Then where did the idea of 215-years in Egypt come from? It was primarily\\n    from a deduction made from the following words in Exodus and Numbers which\\n    lists Kohath as a son of Levi, Amram as a son of Kohath and Aaron as a son\\n    of Amram:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>\\n    <strong>\\n        These are the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations:\\n        Gershon, Kohath, and Merari, the years of the life of Levi being 137\\n        years. <sup>18</sup>The sons of Kohath: Amram&#8230;, the years of the\\n        life of Kohath being 133 years. <sup>20</sup>Amram took as his wife\\n        Jochebed his father\\'s sister, and she bore him Aaron and Moses, the\\n        years of the life of Amram being 137 years. Exodus 6:16, 18, 20.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong><sup>58</sup></strong>\\n    <strong>\\n        These are the clans of Levi: &#8230;of Kohath, the clan of the\\n        Kohathites; &#8230;And Kohath was the father of Amram. <sup>59</sup>The\\n        name of Amram\\'s wife was Jochebed the daughter of Levi, who was born to\\n        Levi in Egypt. And she bore to Amram Aaron and Moses and Miriam their\\n        sister. Numbers 26:58-59.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    While the two narratives appear to be a full and complete record of descent\\n    (Levi-Kohath-Amram-Aaron), the following pages conclusively demonstrate\\n    that these genealogical records are abbreviated. But the historic approach\\n    views them as complete which requires rewriting much other Scripture. In so\\n    doing the cardinal rule of interpretation-inerrancy-is violated. This book\\n    will apply the broader concept of the nature and function of Hebrew\\n    genealogies to such passages. With this approach those violations of\\n    Scripture will be eliminated.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The passages above report three generations leading to Aaron-that of Levi,\\n    Kohath and Amram. No one disputes the relationships in these four\\n    generations, i.e., that Kohath was a direct descendant of Levi, that Amram\\n    was a direct descendant of Kohath and that Aaron was a direct descendant of\\n    Amram. When Jacob moved his people to Egypt, Levi was about 46 years old so\\n    his sons may have been teenagers or even in their twenties. All Jacob\\'s\\n    male descendants accompanied him to Egypt except Joseph and his sons who\\n    were already there. Genesis 46:8-26 records that list and begins:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>\\n    <strong>\\n        Now these are the names of the descendants of Israel, who came into\\n        Egypt, Jacob and his sons, Reuben, Jacob\\'s firstborn, <sup>9</sup>and\\n        the sons of Reuben.&#8230; <sup>10</sup>The sons of Simeon&#8230;. <sup>11</sup>The sons of Levi: Gershon,\\n        Kohath and Merari. Genesis\\n        46:8-11.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Kohath is among the names in the list above. So he was born in Canaan\\n    before the move to Egypt. The next generation mentioned after Kohath was\\n    Amram. Exodus says Amram was a son of Kohath. Numbers agrees, saying Kohath\\n    was the father of Amram. Each passage validates the other. Both Exodus and\\n    Numbers report that Amram and his wife had children-Exodus reports the\\n    births of Aaron and Moses while Numbers reveals the names of three-Aaron,\\n    Moses and Miriam. The 215-year view teaches these four\\n    generations-Levi-Kohath-Amram-Aaron-are consecutive, i.e., immediate\\n    father-son relationships and span the 215-years in Egypt.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    How long of a sojourn in Egypt could they possibly span? Let\\'s calculate.\\n    Suppose each of these generations dwelling in Egypt fathered his named son\\n    in the last year of his life. This number would be the maximum number of\\n    years these four generations could have contributed to the total sojourn in\\n    Egypt if the genealogies were consecutive without any gaps or omissions.\\n    Then that number could be viewed in the light of a 215 or 430-year sojourn.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Calculations: Aaron was 83 at the time of the Exodus, so he accounts for 83\\n    years in Egypt (Exodus 7:7). Levi\\'s grandson, Amram lived 137 years (Exodus\\n    6:20), all of them in Egypt. Add: 137 + 83 = 220 years. None of Levi\\'s\\n    years in Egypt can count since his son Kohath was already alive when they\\n    moved to Egypt. The only father left to contribute years in Egypt is\\n    Kohath. How many years did he contribute? Scripture doesn\\'t tell his age\\n    when they arrived, so for contrast both the maximum and minimum years\\n    possible will be calculated.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <u>Kohath\\'s minimum age</u>\\n    : he was alive when they moved down to Egypt and he had a younger brother.\\n    If his younger brother had just been born, Kohath could have been as young\\n    as one year old.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <u>Kohath\\'s maximum age</u>\\n    : eleven sons were born to Jacob within a nine-year time span at uncle\\n    Laban\\'s place. Levi was #3 and Joseph was #11. Thus, Levi was born about\\n    two years into the nine-year time span while Joseph was born last so he was\\n    born about seven years later. This makes Levi about seven years older than\\n    Joseph. Scripture reveals that Joseph was 39 when his family joined him in\\n    Egypt; Levi would have been about 46 (39+7=46). At this time Jacob\\'s sons\\n    were starting families when they were very young, even younger than 20. If\\n    Levi\\'s second son, Kohath, was born when his father was just 20, he would\\n    have been 26 when they moved to Egypt.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <u>Maximum Range for the age of Kohath</u>\\n    : So Kohath could have been as young as one or as old as 26 when the family\\n    moved to Egypt. If he were just one year old, he would contribute the most\\n    number of years to the Egyptian sojourn. So that number will be found\\n    first. Kohath died at the age of 133 (Exodus 6:18) so he could have\\n    contributed as many as 132 years to Israel\\'s time in Egypt. Now the numbers\\n    are available to determine the absolute maximum number of years in Egypt if\\n    this genealogy (Levi-Kohath-Amram-Aaron) is complete. Aaron provides 83\\n    years. Amram provides another 137 years and Kohath could have provided up\\n    to 132 years. The total is 352 (83+137+132=352).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Three hundred fifty-two years is the maximum number of years these three\\n    named fathers could contribute towards Israel\\'s total sojourn in Egypt if\\n    this list is complete. Although, it is most unlikely that a father would\\n    have had his named heir in the very year he died at such advanced ages. For\\n    this to happen twice in a row is even more unlikely. As already noted,\\n    Jacob\\'s sons were starting families as early as the age of 20. But for now,\\n    the maximum possible number of years in Egypt has been found if this\\n    genealogy is complete. That total number of years, 352 years, is more than\\n    enough for a 215-year sojourn but it is not enough years for a 430-year\\n    sojourn.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Because of this the 215-year people conclude that when Moses said Israel\\'s\\n    sojourn was 430-years (Exodus 12:40), he was referring to the entire time\\n    from Abraham\\'s arrival in Canaan until the Exodus. Scripture reports that\\n    Abraham, Isaac and Jacob lived in Canaan 215-years before the move to\\n    Egypt. The remaining 215-years would be the years that are left for\\n    Israel\\'s sojourn in Egypt. Thus, they say, Israel sojourned in Egypt 215,\\n    not 430-years.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    But that interpretation conflicts with the very words of God, Stephen and\\n    Paul as well as those of Moses, all of whom uphold the 430-year number for\\n    the years Israel was in Egypt. In effect this approach jumps from the\\n    frying pan-trying to escape the difficulty of Exodus 6 and Numbers 26-into\\n    the fire-doing violence to the words of God, Moses, Stephen and Paul. If\\n    the Exodus and Numbers passages will only support a 215-year sojourn while\\n    the four witnesses testify to a 430-year sojourn, the Bible apparently is\\n    contradicting itself and inerrancy is compromised. Since inerrancy assures\\n    that Scripture does not contradict itself, how is this dilemma resolved?\\n    The answer is found in the hidden beauty of Hebrew genealogies.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>The Hidden Beauty of Hebrew Genealogies</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Because Biblical Hebrew relational terms were used in both narrow and broad\\n    senses, \"father\" could mean father, grandfather or ancestor. The same was\\n    true of son, beget, and other common kinship terms. In Hebrew genealogies\\n    both the narrow and broad senses of these family relationships were\\n    employed. In the Levi-Aaron genealogy the maximum possible consecutive\\n    years of the named four living in Egypt (352) falls far short of 430-years\\n    in Egypt. To get 430-years more generations are needed. Since they are not\\n    stated, <strong>this genealogy is abbreviated.</strong> Generations are\\n    omitted. The following table shows the impossibility of four generations\\n    spanning 430-years on the left and therefore what missing generations might\\n    look like on the right.\\n</p>\\n<table

Amram had a son who had a son and somewhere down\\n    the line Aaron, Moses and Miriam were born. To say Aaron was the son of\\n    Amram when many generations came in between is no different than Matthew\\n    1:1 saying Jesus Christ was the son of David when many generations came in\\n    between. This was a common and accepted way for ancient Hebrews to state\\n    their genealogical relationships.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Conclusion to the 215/430 Debate</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    This chapter began by pointing out that a 215-year Egyptian sojourn is not\\n    stated in Scripture but is primarily a deduction based on the Levi-Aaron\\n    genealogy recorded in Exodus 6 and Numbers 26. The few generations stated\\n    in those two passages do not permit a 430-year sojourn. While those\\n    passages appear to be reporting that a grandson of Levi married a daughter\\n    of Levi and they became the immediate parents of Miriam, Aaron and Moses,\\n    that is the overview but there is more to the story. Rather Amram and\\n    Jochebed had these children through intermediate generations. Omitting\\n    generations between Amram and Aaron was not a scribal error; it was a way\\n    to state genealogies efficiently.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Nature of the Levi-Aaron Abbreviation</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The Jewish people all descended from a common ancestor. The God of creation\\n    told that ancestor, Abraham, that He would make of him a great nation. His\\n    grandson, Jacob, had twelve sons. Each formed a unit of the promised nation\\n    called a tribe. The sons and sometimes further descendants of these tribal\\n    fathers formed units within each tribe with various designations. As\\n    populations increased in succeeding generations that division was further\\n    broken down into a third level. It also had various names. Knowing a\\n    person\\'s identity with these three levels provided a powerful picture of\\n    the person. It showed where he belonged in the nation.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    God said all booty from the battle of Jericho was under a ban. A soldier\\n    violated the ban. In judgment God caused the Israelites to lose their next\\n    battle. When the leaders cried out to God, He said to find the guilty\\n    soldier and execute him. To find him they were to bring each tribe before\\n    the LORD. Scripture continues: \"And the tribe that the LORD takes by lot\\n    shall come near by clans. And the clan that the LORD takes shall come near\\n    by households. And the household that the LORD takes shall come near man by\\n    man\" Joshua 7:14. Here is an instance where God Himself spoke of those\\n    three levels of organization of the nation-He called them tribe, clan and\\n    household (ESV). While Scripture uses various designations for them in\\n    other places, here God used specific designations for them. This book will\\n    follow His example and refer to that first level as tribe, to the second\\n    level as clan and to the third level as household.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Without question Levi, the third son of Jacob, formed a tribe. Numbers 26\\n    speaks of the second census of Israel. It was conducted just before\\n    entering Canaan. The tribe of Levi was dedicated to the spiritual life of\\n    Israel so its population was not counted with the other tribes that became\\n    the army of Israel. In the census each of the twelve ordinary tribes are\\n    individually named. In doing so Scripture speaks of each son as follows:\\n    \"Reuben, the firstborn of Israel, the sons of Reuben: of\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Hanoch, the clans of the Hanochites&#8230;.\" Numbers 26:5. The chapter\\n    lists each of the twelve tribes with the same sons as found in the list\\n    that went to Egypt 470 years earlier. Then it speaks of the tribe of Levi\\n    in the same way: \"This was the list of the Levites according to their\\n    clans: of Gershon, the clan of the Gershonites; of Kohath, the clan of the\\n    Kohathites; of Merari, the clan of the Merarites\" (Numbers 26:58). Next it\\n    says that Kohath was the father of Amram. So, the organization of Israel\\n    adds to the view that these names are consecutive: Levi-Kohath-Amram.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    When Moses recorded the Levi-Aaron list, he first cited the tribe that\\n    Aaron belonged to (Levi), then the clan (Kohath) and finally the household\\n    (Amram). He knew who Aaron\\'s father, grandfather and great grandfather\\n    were. But they were unknown and unimportant to the nation at large. To list\\n    them would have been tedious, clumsy and unnecessary. But knowing the three\\n    levels of Aaron\\'s ancestry was very important. This pedigree showed that\\n    both Aaron and his younger brother Moses were part of the very foundation\\n    of the nation. While God called Moses and authenticated him with signs,\\n    ancestors that laid the foundation of the Hebrew people added respect and\\n    legitimacy to him as God\\'s chosen leader. This understanding of purpose\\n    explains why Levi\\'s list is so short. Moses omitted all the generations\\n    between Amram and Aaron. The existence of one undeniably abbreviated Hebrew\\n    genealogy in Scripture sets a precedent. If one genealogy was abbreviated,\\n    others could be as well. <strong></strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Implications for Shem\\'s Genealogy </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    While the abbreviation of most Hebrew genealogies would have no significant\\n    effect on the date of the Flood, an abbreviation in Shem\\'s genealogy would.\\n    Then, adding those numbers would give an incorrect date. But Shem\\'s\\n    genealogy contains a feature that makes it different from the Levi-Aaron\\n    list. It not only identifies each father\\'s son but gives the year when that\\n    son was born, saying two years after the Flood a son by the name of\\n    Arpachshad was born to Shem (Genesis 11:10). It continues by saying that\\n    when Arpachshad had lived 35 years, he fathered Shelah (Genesis 11:12).\\n    Scripture states the age of each succeeding father when his heir was born.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    This feature appears to assure that Shem\\'s list is complete-no ifs, ands or\\n    buts. Nevertheless, in view of the fact that most inerrancy scholars are\\n    certain the Ussher date is too late, is there anything in Scripture to\\n    suggest the years of any of the fathers might be interpreted differently?\\n    Does Scripture anywhere provide information or give an example that would\\n    answer this difficulty? In fact it does. The very iron-clad genealogy of\\n    Levi provides a completely satisfactory solution to the Shem issue in the\\n    following way.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    What is overlooked is that the Levi-Aaron list also gives factual details\\n    about the father before the confirmed omission. While some of that\\n    information could be true of Aaron\\'s immediate parents, other factual\\n    details make it impossible for Amram to be the immediate father of Aaron.\\n    If so, to whom does that factual information apply? It must be true of the\\n    unnamed immediate son of Amram and only in a broad sense is it true of any\\n    further omitted generations and of Aaron. The following paragraphs identify\\n    an amazing list of factual details about the generation in question.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The father at issue is the third name in the Levi-Kohath-Amram-Aaron\\n    genealogy, Amram. The following facts are stated in Scripture about him:\\n    first, Amram is the first of four named sons born to Kohath (Exodus 6:18).\\n    Remember, Kohath was alive when Jacob joined Joseph to begin the sojourn in\\n    Egypt. Second, Amram took a wife (Exodus 6:20). Third, her name was\\n    Jochebed (Exodus 6:20, Numbers 26:59). Fourth, she was the daughter of Levi\\n    (Numbers 26:59); fifth, she was the sister of Amram\\'s father (Exodus 6:20)\\n    and, sixth, she was born in Egypt (Numbers 26:59). In other words this\\n    daughter of Levi was not born in Canaan like Levi\\'s three sons-Gershon,\\n    Kohath and Merari (Genesis 46:11). Rather, she was born after the move,\\n    making her younger than her three brothers.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Seventh, since Amram was not listed among those sons of Jacob that moved to\\n    Egypt (Genesis 46:11), he, too, was born after the move, that is, he too\\n    was born in Egypt. If Scripture hadn\\'t included the information about\\n    Jochebed being born in Egypt, it might have left the impression that Amram\\n    married someone old enough to be his mother. Eighth, in addition to Aaron,\\n    Moses was also born to Amram (Exodus 6:20). Ninth, in addition to Aaron and\\n    Moses, Miriam was also born to Amram and Jochebed (Numbers 26:59). Indeed,\\n    depending on what is counted, up to nine specific facts are revealed in\\n    Scripture about the third generation male in the Levi-Aaron list of Exodus\\n    6:18-22 and Numbers 26:58-59.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Because Hebrews commonly named descendants after famous ancestors, some of\\n    these facts could apply to the parents of Aaron. But the fact that both\\n    Amram and Jochebed were born at the beginning of the 430-year sojourn in\\n    Egypt while Aaron was born near the end of that 430-year period separates\\n    the third and fourth names in the Levi list by some 300 years. Three\\n    hundred years makes it impossible for Aaron to be the immediate son of\\n    Amram. Therefore, those nine entirely true factual details about Amram\\n    apply to his unnamed son and only by the Hebrew custom of viewing all\\n    descendants as the son of the father do they apply to Aaron.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Some might suggest that numbers are more factual than other information,\\n    that in the statement \"When Eber had lived 34 years, he fathered Peleg\"\\n    (Genesis 11:16), the number \"34\" is an absolute fact and cannot be viewed\\n    in any other way. We agree. The number \"34\" is an absolute fact. It cannot\\n    be viewed in any other way. It is just like the absolute fact of Jochebed\\n    being born in Egypt. Thus, the entire list of nine facts about Amram cannot\\n    be viewed in any other way. The insight lacking through all church history\\n    was that Scripture used Hebrew family relational terms in both a narrow\\n    sense and a broad sense. The question here is whether Eber fathering Peleg\\n    is used in a narrow sense or broad sense. If the writer used it in the\\n    broad sense, generations are omitted between Eber and Peleg.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The Levi-Aaron list becomes the biblical pattern for understanding details\\n    of a father before a suspected omission. The details apply to the first\\n    unnamed son while the name that appears is used in the broad sense of a son\\n    further down the line. For beyond doubt names are missing between Amram and\\n    Aaron because Aaron came some 300 years after Amram. To remove that\\n    impossible timespan previous generations argued fiercely for a 215-year\\n    sojourn in Egypt. Since some creationists still hold that view, the entire\\n    next chapter explains the impossibility of that position.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    When the biblical pattern is applied to Shem\\'s list, if there are one or\\n    more omissions, the age of the father when his heir was born refers\\n    specifically to the first unnamed generation. But a high degree of\\n    certainty is needed to suspect names are omitted from any list. Shem\\'s list\\n    gives two. First is the impossibly late Flood date it produces apart from\\n    omitted names. But chapter seven gives an overwhelming second reason. While\\n    longevity decreased between two and eight years per generation after the\\n    Flood, the decrease between Eber and Peleg is 225 years or 61% of the\\n    entire decrease from the Flood until human longevity stabilized at 70 years\\n    for a full lifetime. The Eber-Peleg record is another Amram-Aaron case.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Viewing Shem\\'s List as a Chrono-Genealogy </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Those holding that Shem\\'s list is complete add the ages of the fathers when\\n    their sons were fathered and declare that those years make it possible to\\n    determine the date of the Flood. They call that type of genealogy a\\n    chrono-genealogy. They then reason that even if there are omitted<strong><u>names</u></strong> between Eber and\\n    Peleg the<strong><u>number</u></strong> 34 ties Peleg to a <strong><u>chronology</u></strong> and therefore the\\n    total time between\\n    Eber and Peleg cannot exceed 34 years. This argument is also called the\\n    \"bookends\" argument.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Yet, how is a number different from any other category of words that\\n    express an absolutely true detail, such as the detail that Jochebed was the\\n    sister of Amram\\'s father who lived at the beginning of the 430-year sojourn\\n    in Egypt? Clearly there is no difference. Numbers are no different from\\n    other precise words expressing a fact. Words that express true facts are\\n    true whether they are numbers or not. The bookend argument makes a\\n    superficial distinction between numbers and other words and interjects a\\n    false element into the time of the Flood debate.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    While that argument is clever, it is incorrect and must be recognized as an\\n    invention of man to support a particular interpretation of how to treat\\n    those numbers. It is not stated by Scripture and violates how Scripture\\n    itself treats such details in Levi\\'s genealogy. Further it is not verified\\n    by Moses in as much as he did not add up those numbers in Shem\\'s list. Most\\n    important of all this argument could not be why God included those numbers\\n    because they give the wrong answer for the time of the Flood.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Those who hold this view reason: \"Why else would Eber\\'s age be given when\\n    he fathered Peleg other than to tell when the Flood happened?\" In response\\n    Andrew E. Steinmann answered this question (applying it to Genesis 5 as\\n    well as Genesis 11 since the two instances of this format actually provide\\n    a stronger case against viewing them as having a chronological purpose):\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>\\n        This [chrono-genealogical argument] assumes that the information was\\n        included for chronological purposes and then argues that the\\n        genealogies must therefore be useful for chronological calculations. In\\n        fact, the author does not state the reason for including this\\n        information&#8230;. This information could well have illustrated\\n        several points without being intended to be used in chronological\\n        calculations relating to the events of the narrative. For instance, the\\n        information may simply have been intended to demonstrate:\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>1. </strong>\\n    <strong>\\n        The different environmental and societal conditions that prevailed in\\n        that era.

The information would not be superfluous,\\n        but it also would not be useful for the purpose of chronological\\n        calculations.\\n        <a href=\"\" name=\"_ftnref2\" title=\"\">\\n            <sup><strong><sup>[2]</sup></strong></sup>\\n        </a>\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    In fact, the merits of the chrono-genealogical argument are not strong in\\n    the eyes of most Bible scholars. Moses wrote around 1400 BC when the\\n    lifespan of man was 70. Saying that people once lived to the age of 900\\n    would be met with skepticism. Moses knew about the well-known fictitious\\n    stories of exceptionally long lifespans in the past. The Sumerian King List\\n    included one king who was said to have reigned 43,200 years. Moses\\' numbers\\n    had to be separated from such exaggerations. By giving the years before the\\n    birth of the heir, the years after and the total years of each father in\\n    Genesis 5, God through Moses did all He could to assure His readers those\\n    people actually lived that long. Furthermore, those numbers provide the\\n    very patterns that have aided us in building our explanations concerning\\n    man\\'s decreasing longevity which is the key argument for the missing 35-55\\n    generations between Eber and Peleg.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    In the Abstract of Steinmann\\'s 2018 article, he noted a recent spate of\\n    articles arguing that the genealogies of Genesis 5 and 11 were complete,\\n    skipping no generations. In checking his observation this author found that\\n    three of the articles in a single issue of a popular monthly\\n    age-of-the-earth magazine mentioned the too-recent year number. Steinmann\\n    summarized his article as follows: \" <strong>The major arguments they use are defective and falsifiable</strong>\\n    .\"<a href=\"\" name=\"_ftnref3\" title=\"\"><sup><sup>[3]</sup></sup></a> His\\n    version is 18 pages. But he only scratches the surface. Somewhere a book\\n    must spell it all out in detail. Hopefully by showing the nature and\\n    function of ancient Hebrew genealogies <em>Hidden Beauty</em> will open\\n    people\\'s eyes to the frequent abbreviating of biblical genealogies.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>The Abbreviation of Shem\\'s Genealogy in Retrospect</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Human longevity declined gradually from the first fathers born after the\\n    Flood until the days of Moses, from average full lifespans of 450 years to\\n    average full lifespans of 70 years. This is an average full lifespan\\n    decline of 380 years. Scripture gives abundant details to track this\\n    decline. Shelah who represents the second generation born after the Flood\\n    (433-year lifespan), lived five fewer years than his father (438-year\\n    lifespan) who was born two years after the Flood. Over the next two\\n    millennia the rate of decline was sometimes faster and sometimes slower but\\n    longevity stopped declining in Moses\\' day when he wrote that a full\\n    lifetime was 70 years. To this day 70 years generally stands as a full\\n    lifespan. But there was one exception during the gradual decline of those\\n    born after the Flood, a sudden one-time drop of 225 years. This one\\n    instance is between Eber and Peleg. Eber lived 464 years while Peleg, the\\n    next named person, lived 239 years, a decline of 225 years or 61%\\n    (225/369=61%) of the total decline of human longevity after the Flood. This\\n    eye-popping decline was either produced by another catastrophe as great as\\n    the Flood or it is another Amram-Aaron case. There is no evidence for such\\n    a catastrophe 100 years after the Flood. Thus, it is another Amram-Aaron\\n    case.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The Amram-Aaron sequence leaves out an estimated 8-12 generations. The\\n    Eber-Peleg sequence leaves out as many as 55 generations. With new\\n    generations starting each 30-34 years when people lived 200-450 years, this\\n    represents up to 1900 more years of human history after the Flood than\\n    previously thought (and pushes the first man back accordingly). Since God\\n    is not more specific, we dare not violate this ambiguity. These few\\n    additional years make no difference at all in the creation-evolution\\n    controversy, but they make a world of difference in honoring Scripture\\n    because they treat both the words and numbers of Scripture as inerrant.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Once we understand what the Bible literally says, we are free to examine\\n    the findings of secular disciplines; for, sooner or later when the secular\\n    world has all the facts, it will confirm God\\'s record. So, have such\\n    findings caught up with the revelation of Scripture? The Flood changed the\\n    face of the earth up to ten miles down so it obliterated the physical\\n    evidence of human existence that would speak to the condensing of the\\n    Genesis 5 list. However, the Genesis 11 list involves the history of man\\n    after the Flood. To some extent evidence for that history still exists and\\n    is constantly being discovered through such disciplines as studies of\\n    Hebrew and related languages, textual studies, archaeology and ancient Near\\n    East history.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Adding the time represented in the missing generations between Eber and\\n    Peleg to the additional 215-years in Egypt provides enough time to\\n    encompass all well-established human history as found in written records\\n    since the Flood. Thus, getting the genealogies of Scripture right provides\\n    harmony between the words and numbers of Scripture and removes a huge\\n    stumbling block between biblical creationists and other Evangelical\\n    scholars. (See chapter seven for a full development of the abbreviation of\\n    Shem\\'s genealogy.)\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The next chapter examines the words of four witnesses to a 430-year sojourn\\n    in Egypt. In Archbishop Ussher\\'s day the text of Exodus 12:40 was\\n    deficient; so, for centuries believers held the 215-year view believing\\n    they were standing on Scripture. Over the next two centuries the text was\\n    clarified. Now eminent Hebrew scholars are unanimous-Moses clearly says the\\n    Egyptian sojourn lasted 430-years. But all along the words of God Himself\\n    to Abraham in Genesis 15:13 pointed to a 430-year sojourn in Egypt and\\n    excluded a 215-year sojourn.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    viewed as contradictions and clumsily reinterpreted.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The Executive Summary (pages 5-6) explains the conclusion of this book-that\\n    Shem\\'s genealogy of Genesis 11 omits 35-55 generations. This chapter\\n    introduces the first evidence for that conclusion. The Levi-Aaron list\\n    covers about 500 years which includes the 430-years Israel dwelt in Egypt.\\n    Yet it contains just four people (Levi-Kohath-Amram-Aaron). We are given\\n    much information about them, even their overlapping life spans which fail\\n    to bridge those 500 years. The list omits up to a dozen names.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    This position has not been the view of the church historically. The reason\\n    has to do with the number of years Israel sojourned in Egypt. Whether it\\n    was 215 or 430-years has been a continuing controversy for 2000 years. The\\n    preponderance of Scriptural evidence favors 430 but historical evidence\\n    supported 215. For instance, the Septuagint (i.e., the Greek translation of\\n    the Old Testament) says Israel sojourned in Canaan and Egypt 430-years.\\n    Early authorities like Josephus concurred. The church fathers added their\\n    \"Amen.\" Because the Hebrew text of the key passage, Exodus 12:40, had a\\n    problem, it could be understood to mean that 430-years was the total time\\n    in Canaan <strong>and</strong>Egypt. Events in the lives of Abraham and\\n    Jacob were then erroneously interpreted to support a 215-year Egyptian\\n    sojourn. As a result, the Levi-Aaron list was viewed as complete. To this\\n    day some still insist that Israel only sojourned in Egypt 215-years.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    While 430-years in Egypt only adds a few years to the antiquity of Noah\\'s\\n    Flood, an incomplete Levi list opens the door to other Old Testament\\n    genealogies being incomplete. An abbreviated Shem list could push the date\\n    for the Flood back hundreds or even thousands of years. To find the\\n    approximate time of the Flood, <em>Hidden Beauty</em> must address the many\\n    controversies that have clouded this question. In the process the book has\\n    become very long.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Before proceeding, it must be stated that foundational to this book is the\\n    doctrine of the inerrancy of Scripture, the biblical truth that God so\\n    moved its authors that they wrote His message without error. It applies to\\n    every word of the original writings. It means that all Scripture was\\n    originally in harmony with the original writings of all other\\n    Scripture-that no statement contradicted any other statement in its\\n    original writing. It also means that all Scripture is important, that every\\n    word is equally true, that no Scripture should be dismissed, overlooked or\\n    regarded as insignificant. The church has restated this doctrine at\\n    critical times in history. Most recently in the Fall of 1978 an\\n    international gathering of nearly 300 noted evangelical scholars produced\\n    \"The Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy\" which reaffirmed this truth\\n    in clear but precise terms. <a href=\"\" name=\"_ftnref4\" title=\"\"><sup><sup>[4]</sup></sup></a>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Because Scripture is God\\'s word, it is the final authority on every issue\\n    it addresses. In this book every effort is made to answer each issue solely\\n    on the basis of what the Bible itself says. After determining what\\n    Scripture says, the secular view of where and when advanced societies first\\n    developed will be discussed because surprisingly it supports what the Bible\\n    has said all along. Also, by way of introduction the following purpose and\\n    function of Hebrew genealogies must ever be in the minds of those who\\n    discuss them.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Overview of Hebrew Genealogies</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Most peoples, and especially the West, have used genealogies and\\n    chronologies to display an unbroken list of immediate relationships such as\\n    father-son, rulers, priests, etc. In contrast, the basic idea of Hebrew\\n    genealogies was identity, not succession. Hebrews identified descendants\\n    with their forefathers and forefathers with their descendants. It could be\\n    boiled down to this: all descendants were in the loins of their forefathers\\n    and all forefathers were the fathers of their descendants. It was perfectly\\n    accurate in Hebrew usage to say B was the son of A or to say G was the son\\n    of A when actually generations B-F came between A and G.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    For example, Hebrew genealogies could be as specific as Adam knew Eve who\\n    conceived Cain (Genesis 4:1) or as broad as \"Jesus Christ, the son of\\n    David\" (Matthew 1:1). Cain was the immediate result of the union of Adam\\n    and Eve. There were no intermediate generations between the parents and\\n    their son. This is the narrow use in Hebrew thinking (A begat B). On the\\n    other hand, one thousand years separated David from his distant son Jesus\\n    Christ. This is the broad use of genealogies in Scripture (A begat G). The\\n    broad use could compact many generations into one, yet be perfectly\\n    truthful. The intentional skipping or omitting of names could be considered\\n    condensing or abbreviating. It was beautifully efficient and simple.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Matthew made no error when he wrote \"Jesus Christ, the son of David.\" His\\n    purpose was to identify Jesus Christ with David genealogically. Authors of\\n    Scripture determined the degree of completeness of a blood line, often\\n    providing only as many names as their purpose required. Those in the day of\\n    any particular author would discern whether his list was complete or not,\\n    but as time passed this discernment became more difficult. In time, even\\n    Bible scholars, misunderstanding this broader use of Hebrew genealogies,\\n    began to wrest the Scripture with their interpretations.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Condensing a Genealogical List-A Clear OT Example </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    A 215-year sojourn by Jacob and his descendants in Egypt is an essential\\n    element in the historic view that the Flood occurred about 2348 BC\\n    according to Archbishop James Ussher. His monumental work, <em>Annals of the World</em>, first published in Latin in\\n    1650, used the\\n    typical approach of working back from later known dates to Abraham. This\\n    method then added the years when each father in Shem\\'s genealogy of Genesis\\n    11 had his heir to finally reach the Flood date.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    A 430-year Egyptian sojourn adds a mere 215-years to this date. But\\n    recognizing a 430-year Egyptian sojourn introduces a game-changing\\n    precedent. It means that many names are omitted in Levi\\'s genealogy that\\n    appears to be complete. Since the Shem list has characteristics similar to\\n    the Levi-Aaron list, it opens the door to omitted names in that list which\\n    some vehemently deny.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    While many have been told that Scripture is confusing about the years\\n    Israel spent in Egypt, the next chapter will show that no less than God\\n    Himself witnessed to a 430-year sojourn there. But that is not all. Moses\\n    likewise witnessed to 430-years in Egypt. Then over a millennium later\\n    Stephen affirmed God\\'s word and Paul affirmed Moses\\' word. On the other\\n    hand, nowhere does Scripture state that Israel sojourned in Egypt\\n    215-years. Nowhere!\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Then where did the idea of 215-years in Egypt come from? It was primarily\\n    from a deduction made from the following words in Exodus and Numbers which\\n    lists Kohath as a son of Levi, Amram as a son of Kohath and Aaron as a son\\n    of Amram:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong><sup>16</sup></strong>\\n    <strong>\\n        These are the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations:\\n        Gershon, Kohath, and Merari, the years of the life of Levi being 137\\n        years. <sup>18</sup>The sons of Kohath: Amram&#8230;, the years of the\\n        life of Kohath being 133 years. <sup>20</sup>Amram took as his wife\\n        Jochebed his father\\'s sister, and she bore him Aaron and Moses, the\\n        years of the life of Amram being 137 years. Exodus 6:16, 18, 20.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong><sup>58</sup></strong>\\n    <strong>\\n        These are the clans of Levi: &#8230;of Kohath, the clan of the\\n        Kohathites; &#8230;And Kohath was the father of Amram. <sup>59</sup>The\\n        name of Amram\\'s wife was Jochebed the daughter of Levi, who was born to\\n        Levi in Egypt. And she bore to Amram Aaron and Moses and Miriam their\\n        sister. Numbers 26:58-59.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    While the two narratives appear to be a full and complete record of descent\\n    (Levi-Kohath-Amram-Aaron), the following pages conclusively demonstrate\\n    that these genealogical records are abbreviated. But the historic approach\\n    views them as complete which requires rewriting much other Scripture. In so\\n    doing the cardinal rule of interpretation-inerrancy-is violated. This book\\n    will apply the broader concept of the nature and function of Hebrew\\n    genealogies to such passages. With this approach those violations of\\n    Scripture will be eliminated.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The passages above report three generations leading to Aaron-that of Levi,\\n    Kohath and Amram. No one disputes the relationships in these four\\n    generations, i.e., that Kohath was a direct descendant of Levi, that Amram\\n    was a direct descendant of Kohath and that Aaron was a direct descendant of\\n    Amram. When Jacob moved his people to Egypt, Levi was about 46 years old so\\n    his sons may have been teenagers or even in their twenties. All Jacob\\'s\\n    male descendants accompanied him to Egypt except Joseph and his sons who\\n    were already there. Genesis 46:8-26 records that list and begins:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>\\n    <strong>\\n        Now these are the names of the descendants of Israel, who came into\\n        Egypt, Jacob and his sons, Reuben, Jacob\\'s firstborn, <sup>9</sup>and\\n        the sons of Reuben.&#8230; <sup>10</sup>The sons of Simeon&#8230;. <sup>11</sup>The sons of Levi: Gershon,\\n        Kohath and Merari. Genesis\\n        46:8-11.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Kohath is among the names in the list above. So he was born in Canaan\\n    before the move to Egypt. The next generation mentioned after Kohath was\\n    Amram. Exodus says Amram was a son of Kohath. Numbers agrees, saying Kohath\\n    was the father of Amram. Each passage validates the other. Both Exodus and\\n    Numbers report that Amram and his wife had children-Exodus reports the\\n    births of Aaron and Moses while Numbers reveals the names of three-Aaron,\\n    Moses and Miriam. The 215-year view teaches these four\\n    generations-Levi-Kohath-Amram-Aaron-are consecutive, i.e., immediate\\n    father-son relationships and span the 215-years in Egypt.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    How long of a sojourn in Egypt could they possibly span? Let\\'s calculate.\\n    Suppose each of these generations dwelling in Egypt fathered his named son\\n    in the last year of his life. This number would be the maximum number of\\n    years these four generations could have contributed to the total sojourn in\\n    Egypt if the genealogies were consecutive without any gaps or omissions.\\n    Then that number could be viewed in the light of a 215 or 430-year sojourn.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Calculations: Aaron was 83 at the time of the Exodus, so he accounts for 83\\n    years in Egypt (Exodus 7:7). Levi\\'s grandson, Amram lived 137 years (Exodus\\n    6:20), all of them in Egypt. Add: 137 + 83 = 220 years. None of Levi\\'s\\n    years in Egypt can count since his son Kohath was already alive when they\\n    moved to Egypt. The only father left to contribute years in Egypt is\\n    Kohath. How many years did he contribute? Scripture doesn\\'t tell his age\\n    when they arrived, so for contrast both the maximum and minimum years\\n    possible will be calculated.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <u>Kohath\\'s minimum age</u>\\n    : he was alive when they moved down to Egypt and he had a younger brother.\\n    If his younger brother had just been born, Kohath could have been as young\\n    as one year old.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <u>Kohath\\'s maximum age</u>\\n    : eleven sons were born to Jacob within a nine-year time span at uncle\\n    Laban\\'s place. Levi was #3 and Joseph was #11. Thus, Levi was born about\\n    two years into the nine-year time span while Joseph was born last so he was\\n    born about seven years later. This makes Levi about seven years older than\\n    Joseph. Scripture reveals that Joseph was 39 when his family joined him in\\n    Egypt; Levi would have been about 46 (39+7=46). At this time Jacob\\'s sons\\n    were starting families when they were very young, even younger than 20. If\\n    Levi\\'s second son, Kohath, was born when his father was just 20, he would\\n    have been 26 when they moved to Egypt.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <u>Maximum Range for the age of Kohath</u>\\n    : So Kohath could have been as young as one or as old as 26 when the family\\n    moved to Egypt. If he were just one year old, he would contribute the most\\n    number of years to the Egyptian sojourn. So that number will be found\\n    first. Kohath died at the age of 133 (Exodus 6:18) so he could have\\n    contributed as many as 132 years to Israel\\'s time in Egypt. Now the numbers\\n    are available to determine the absolute maximum number of years in Egypt if\\n    this genealogy (Levi-Kohath-Amram-Aaron) is complete. Aaron provides 83\\n    years. Amram provides another 137 years and Kohath could have provided up\\n    to 132 years. The total is 352 (83+137+132=352).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Three hundred fifty-two years is the maximum number of years these three\\n    named fathers could contribute towards Israel\\'s total sojourn in Egypt if\\n    this list is complete. Although, it is most unlikely that a father would\\n    have had his named heir in the very year he died at such advanced ages. For\\n    this to happen twice in a row is even more unlikely. As already noted,\\n    Jacob\\'s sons were starting families as early as the age of 20. But for now,\\n    the maximum possible number of years in Egypt has been found if this\\n    genealogy is complete. That total number of years, 352 years, is more than\\n    enough for a 215-year sojourn but it is not enough years for a 430-year\\n    sojourn.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Because of this the 215-year people conclude that when Moses said Israel\\'s\\n    sojourn was 430-years (Exodus 12:40), he was referring to the entire time\\n    from Abraham\\'s arrival in Canaan until the Exodus. Scripture reports that\\n    Abraham, Isaac and Jacob lived in Canaan 215-years before the move to\\n    Egypt. The remaining 215-years would be the years that are left for\\n    Israel\\'s sojourn in Egypt. Thus, they say, Israel sojourned in Egypt 215,\\n    not 430-years.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    But that interpretation conflicts with the very words of God, Stephen and\\n    Paul as well as those of Moses, all of whom uphold the 430-year number for\\n    the years Israel was in Egypt. In effect this approach jumps from the\\n    frying pan-trying to escape the difficulty of Exodus 6 and Numbers 26-into\\n    the fire-doing violence to the words of God, Moses, Stephen and Paul. If\\n    the Exodus and Numbers passages will only support a 215-year sojourn while\\n    the four witnesses testify to a 430-year sojourn, the Bible apparently is\\n    contradicting itself and inerrancy is compromised. Since inerrancy assures\\n    that Scripture does not contradict itself, how is this dilemma resolved?\\n    The answer is found in the hidden beauty of Hebrew genealogies.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>The Hidden Beauty of Hebrew Genealogies</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Because Biblical Hebrew relational terms were used in both narrow and broad\\n    senses, \"father\" could mean father, grandfather or ancestor. The same was\\n    true of son, beget, and other common kinship terms. In Hebrew genealogies\\n    both the narrow and broad senses of these family relationships were\\n    employed. In the Levi-Aaron genealogy the maximum possible consecutive\\n    years of the named four living in Egypt (352) falls far short of 430-years\\n    in Egypt. To get 430-years more generations are needed. Since they are not\\n    stated, <strong>this genealogy is abbreviated.</strong> Generations are\\n    omitted. The following table shows the impossibility of four generations\\n    spanning 430-years on the left and therefore what missing generations might\\n    look like on the right.\\n</p>\\n<table

Amram had a son who had a son and somewhere down\\n    the line Aaron, Moses and Miriam were born. To say Aaron was the son of\\n    Amram when many generations came in between is no different than Matthew\\n    1:1 saying Jesus Christ was the son of David when many generations came in\\n    between. This was a common and accepted way for ancient Hebrews to state\\n    their genealogical relationships.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Conclusion to the 215/430 Debate</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    This chapter began by pointing out that a 215-year Egyptian sojourn is not\\n    stated in Scripture but is primarily a deduction based on the Levi-Aaron\\n    genealogy recorded in Exodus 6 and Numbers 26. The few generations stated\\n    in those two passages do not permit a 430-year sojourn. While those\\n    passages appear to be reporting that a grandson of Levi married a daughter\\n    of Levi and they became the immediate parents of Miriam, Aaron and Moses,\\n    that is the overview but there is more to the story. Rather Amram and\\n    Jochebed had these children through intermediate generations. Omitting\\n    generations between Amram and Aaron was not a scribal error; it was a way\\n    to state genealogies efficiently.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Nature of the Levi-Aaron Abbreviation</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The Jewish people all descended from a common ancestor. The God of creation\\n    told that ancestor, Abraham, that He would make of him a great nation. His\\n    grandson, Jacob, had twelve sons. Each formed a unit of the promised nation\\n    called a tribe. The sons and sometimes further descendants of these tribal\\n    fathers formed units within each tribe with various designations. As\\n    populations increased in succeeding generations that division was further\\n    broken down into a third level. It also had various names. Knowing a\\n    person\\'s identity with these three levels provided a powerful picture of\\n    the person. It showed where he belonged in the nation.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    God said all booty from the battle of Jericho was under a ban. A soldier\\n    violated the ban. In judgment God caused the Israelites to lose their next\\n    battle. When the leaders cried out to God, He said to find the guilty\\n    soldier and execute him. To find him they were to bring each tribe before\\n    the LORD. Scripture continues: \"And the tribe that the LORD takes by lot\\n    shall come near by clans. And the clan that the LORD takes shall come near\\n    by households. And the household that the LORD takes shall come near man by\\n    man\" Joshua 7:14. Here is an instance where God Himself spoke of those\\n    three levels of organization of the nation-He called them tribe, clan and\\n    household (ESV). While Scripture uses various designations for them in\\n    other places, here God used specific designations for them. This book will\\n    follow His example and refer to that first level as tribe, to the second\\n    level as clan and to the third level as household.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Without question Levi, the third son of Jacob, formed a tribe. Numbers 26\\n    speaks of the second census of Israel. It was conducted just before\\n    entering Canaan. The tribe of Levi was dedicated to the spiritual life of\\n    Israel so its population was not counted with the other tribes that became\\n    the army of Israel. In the census each of the twelve ordinary tribes are\\n    individually named. In doing so Scripture speaks of each son as follows:\\n    \"Reuben, the firstborn of Israel, the sons of Reuben: of\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Hanoch, the clans of the Hanochites&#8230;.\" Numbers 26:5. The chapter\\n    lists each of the twelve tribes with the same sons as found in the list\\n    that went to Egypt 470 years earlier. Then it speaks of the tribe of Levi\\n    in the same way: \"This was the list of the Levites according to their\\n    clans: of Gershon, the clan of the Gershonites; of Kohath, the clan of the\\n    Kohathites; of Merari, the clan of the Merarites\" (Numbers 26:58). Next it\\n    says that Kohath was the father of Amram. So, the organization of Israel\\n    adds to the view that these names are consecutive: Levi-Kohath-Amram.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    When Moses recorded the Levi-Aaron list, he first cited the tribe that\\n    Aaron belonged to (Levi), then the clan (Kohath) and finally the household\\n    (Amram). He knew who Aaron\\'s father, grandfather and great grandfather\\n    were. But they were unknown and unimportant to the nation at large. To list\\n    them would have been tedious, clumsy and unnecessary. But knowing the three\\n    levels of Aaron\\'s ancestry was very important. This pedigree showed that\\n    both Aaron and his younger brother Moses were part of the very foundation\\n    of the nation. While God called Moses and authenticated him with signs,\\n    ancestors that laid the foundation of the Hebrew people added respect and\\n    legitimacy to him as God\\'s chosen leader. This understanding of purpose\\n    explains why Levi\\'s list is so short. Moses omitted all the generations\\n    between Amram and Aaron. The existence of one undeniably abbreviated Hebrew\\n    genealogy in Scripture sets a precedent. If one genealogy was abbreviated,\\n    others could be as well. <strong></strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Implications for Shem\\'s Genealogy </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    While the abbreviation of most Hebrew genealogies would have no significant\\n    effect on the date of the Flood, an abbreviation in Shem\\'s genealogy would.\\n    Then, adding those numbers would give an incorrect date. But Shem\\'s\\n    genealogy contains a feature that makes it different from the Levi-Aaron\\n    list. It not only identifies each father\\'s son but gives the year when that\\n    son was born, saying two years after the Flood a son by the name of\\n    Arpachshad was born to Shem (Genesis 11:10). It continues by saying that\\n    when Arpachshad had lived 35 years, he fathered Shelah (Genesis 11:12).\\n    Scripture states the age of each succeeding father when his heir was born.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    This feature appears to assure that Shem\\'s list is complete-no ifs, ands or\\n    buts. Nevertheless, in view of the fact that most inerrancy scholars are\\n    certain the Ussher date is too late, is there anything in Scripture to\\n    suggest the years of any of the fathers might be interpreted differently?\\n    Does Scripture anywhere provide information or give an example that would\\n    answer this difficulty? In fact it does. The very iron-clad genealogy of\\n    Levi provides a completely satisfactory solution to the Shem issue in the\\n    following way.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    What is overlooked is that the Levi-Aaron list also gives factual details\\n    about the father before the confirmed omission. While some of that\\n    information could be true of Aaron\\'s immediate parents, other factual\\n    details make it impossible for Amram to be the immediate father of Aaron.\\n    If so, to whom does that factual information apply? It must be true of the\\n    unnamed immediate son of Amram and only in a broad sense is it true of any\\n    further omitted generations and of Aaron. The following paragraphs identify\\n    an amazing list of factual details about the generation in question.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The father at issue is the third name in the Levi-Kohath-Amram-Aaron\\n    genealogy, Amram. The following facts are stated in Scripture about him:\\n    first, Amram is the first of four named sons born to Kohath (Exodus 6:18).\\n    Remember, Kohath was alive when Jacob joined Joseph to begin the sojourn in\\n    Egypt. Second, Amram took a wife (Exodus 6:20). Third, her name was\\n    Jochebed (Exodus 6:20, Numbers 26:59). Fourth, she was the daughter of Levi\\n    (Numbers 26:59); fifth, she was the sister of Amram\\'s father (Exodus 6:20)\\n    and, sixth, she was born in Egypt (Numbers 26:59). In other words this\\n    daughter of Levi was not born in Canaan like Levi\\'s three sons-Gershon,\\n    Kohath and Merari (Genesis 46:11). Rather, she was born after the move,\\n    making her younger than her three brothers.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Seventh, since Amram was not listed among those sons of Jacob that moved to\\n    Egypt (Genesis 46:11), he, too, was born after the move, that is, he too\\n    was born in Egypt. If Scripture hadn\\'t included the information about\\n    Jochebed being born in Egypt, it might have left the impression that Amram\\n    married someone old enough to be his mother. Eighth, in addition to Aaron,\\n    Moses was also born to Amram (Exodus 6:20). Ninth, in addition to Aaron and\\n    Moses, Miriam was also born to Amram and Jochebed (Numbers 26:59). Indeed,\\n    depending on what is counted, up to nine specific facts are revealed in\\n    Scripture about the third generation male in the Levi-Aaron list of Exodus\\n    6:18-22 and Numbers 26:58-59.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Because Hebrews commonly named descendants after famous ancestors, some of\\n    these facts could apply to the parents of Aaron. But the fact that both\\n    Amram and Jochebed were born at the beginning of the 430-year sojourn in\\n    Egypt while Aaron was born near the end of that 430-year period separates\\n    the third and fourth names in the Levi list by some 300 years. Three\\n    hundred years makes it impossible for Aaron to be the immediate son of\\n    Amram. Therefore, those nine entirely true factual details about Amram\\n    apply to his unnamed son and only by the Hebrew custom of viewing all\\n    descendants as the son of the father do they apply to Aaron.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Some might suggest that numbers are more factual than other information,\\n    that in the statement \"When Eber had lived 34 years, he fathered Peleg\"\\n    (Genesis 11:16), the number \"34\" is an absolute fact and cannot be viewed\\n    in any other way. We agree. The number \"34\" is an absolute fact. It cannot\\n    be viewed in any other way. It is just like the absolute fact of Jochebed\\n    being born in Egypt. Thus, the entire list of nine facts about Amram cannot\\n    be viewed in any other way. The insight lacking through all church history\\n    was that Scripture used Hebrew family relational terms in both a narrow\\n    sense and a broad sense. The question here is whether Eber fathering Peleg\\n    is used in a narrow sense or broad sense. If the writer used it in the\\n    broad sense, generations are omitted between Eber and Peleg.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The Levi-Aaron list becomes the biblical pattern for understanding details\\n    of a father before a suspected omission. The details apply to the first\\n    unnamed son while the name that appears is used in the broad sense of a son\\n    further down the line. For beyond doubt names are missing between Amram and\\n    Aaron because Aaron came some 300 years after Amram. To remove that\\n    impossible timespan previous generations argued fiercely for a 215-year\\n    sojourn in Egypt. Since some creationists still hold that view, the entire\\n    next chapter explains the impossibility of that position.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    When the biblical pattern is applied to Shem\\'s list, if there are one or\\n    more omissions, the age of the father when his heir was born refers\\n    specifically to the first unnamed generation. But a high degree of\\n    certainty is needed to suspect names are omitted from any list. Shem\\'s list\\n    gives two. First is the impossibly late Flood date it produces apart from\\n    omitted names. But chapter seven gives an overwhelming second reason. While\\n    longevity decreased between two and eight years per generation after the\\n    Flood, the decrease between Eber and Peleg is 225 years or 61% of the\\n    entire decrease from the Flood until human longevity stabilized at 70 years\\n    for a full lifetime. The Eber-Peleg record is another Amram-Aaron case.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Viewing Shem\\'s List as a Chrono-Genealogy </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Those holding that Shem\\'s list is complete add the ages of the fathers when\\n    their sons were fathered and declare that those years make it possible to\\n    determine the date of the Flood. They call that type of genealogy a\\n    chrono-genealogy. They then reason that even if there are omitted<strong><u>names</u></strong> between Eber and\\n    Peleg the<strong><u>number</u></strong> 34 ties Peleg to a <strong><u>chronology</u></strong> and therefore the\\n    total time between\\n    Eber and Peleg cannot exceed 34 years. This argument is also called the\\n    \"bookends\" argument.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Yet, how is a number different from any other category of words that\\n    express an absolutely true detail, such as the detail that Jochebed was the\\n    sister of Amram\\'s father who lived at the beginning of the 430-year sojourn\\n    in Egypt? Clearly there is no difference. Numbers are no different from\\n    other precise words expressing a fact. Words that express true facts are\\n    true whether they are numbers or not. The bookend argument makes a\\n    superficial distinction between numbers and other words and interjects a\\n    false element into the time of the Flood debate.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    While that argument is clever, it is incorrect and must be recognized as an\\n    invention of man to support a particular interpretation of how to treat\\n    those numbers. It is not stated by Scripture and violates how Scripture\\n    itself treats such details in Levi\\'s genealogy. Further it is not verified\\n    by Moses in as much as he did not add up those numbers in Shem\\'s list. Most\\n    important of all this argument could not be why God included those numbers\\n    because they give the wrong answer for the time of the Flood.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Those who hold this view reason: \"Why else would Eber\\'s age be given when\\n    he fathered Peleg other than to tell when the Flood happened?\" In response\\n    Andrew E. Steinmann answered this question (applying it to Genesis 5 as\\n    well as Genesis 11 since the two instances of this format actually provide\\n    a stronger case against viewing them as having a chronological purpose):\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>\\n        This [chrono-genealogical argument] assumes that the information was\\n        included for chronological purposes and then argues that the\\n        genealogies must therefore be useful for chronological calculations. In\\n        fact, the author does not state the reason for including this\\n        information&#8230;. This information could well have illustrated\\n        several points without being intended to be used in chronological\\n        calculations relating to the events of the narrative. For instance, the\\n        information may simply have been intended to demonstrate:\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>4. </strong>\\n    <strong>\\n        The different environmental and societal conditions that prevailed in\\n        that era.

The information would not be superfluous,\\n        but it also would not be useful for the purpose of chronological\\n        calculations.\\n        <a href=\"\" name=\"_ftnref5\" title=\"\">\\n            <sup><strong><sup>[5]</sup></strong></sup>\\n        </a>\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    In fact, the merits of the chrono-genealogical argument are not strong in\\n    the eyes of most Bible scholars. Moses wrote around 1400 BC when the\\n    lifespan of man was 70. Saying that people once lived to the age of 900\\n    would be met with skepticism. Moses knew about the well-known fictitious\\n    stories of exceptionally long lifespans in the past. The Sumerian King List\\n    included one king who was said to have reigned 43,200 years. Moses\\' numbers\\n    had to be separated from such exaggerations. By giving the years before the\\n    birth of the heir, the years after and the total years of each father in\\n    Genesis 5, God through Moses did all He could to assure His readers those\\n    people actually lived that long. Furthermore, those numbers provide the\\n    very patterns that have aided us in building our explanations concerning\\n    man\\'s decreasing longevity which is the key argument for the missing 35-55\\n    generations between Eber and Peleg.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    In the Abstract of Steinmann\\'s 2018 article, he noted a recent spate of\\n    articles arguing that the genealogies of Genesis 5 and 11 were complete,\\n    skipping no generations. In checking his observation this author found that\\n    three of the articles in a single issue of a popular monthly\\n    age-of-the-earth magazine mentioned the too-recent year number. Steinmann\\n    summarized his article as follows:\\n    <a name=\"_Hlk85297349\">\\n        \"\\n        <strong>\\n            The major arguments they use are defective and falsifiable\\n        </strong>\\n        .\"\\n    </a>\\n    <a href=\"\" name=\"_ftnref6\" title=\"\"><sup><sup>[6]</sup></sup></a>\\n    His version is 18 pages. But he only scratches the surface. Somewhere a\\n    book must spell it all out in detail. Hopefully by showing the nature and\\n    function of ancient Hebrew genealogies <em>Hidden Beauty</em> will open\\n    people\\'s eyes to the frequent abbreviating of biblical genealogies.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>The Abbreviation of Shem\\'s Genealogy in Retrospect</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Human longevity declined gradually from the first fathers born after the\\n    Flood until the days of Moses, from average full lifespans of 450 years to\\n    average full lifespans of 70 years. This is an average full lifespan\\n    decline of 380 years. Scripture gives abundant details to track this\\n    decline. Shelah who represents the second generation born after the Flood\\n    (433-year lifespan), lived five fewer years than his father (438-year\\n    lifespan) who was born two years after the Flood. Over the next two\\n    millennia the rate of decline was sometimes faster and sometimes slower but\\n    longevity stopped declining in Moses\\' day when he wrote that a full\\n    lifetime was 70 years. To this day 70 years generally stands as a full\\n    lifespan. But there was one exception during the gradual decline of those\\n    born after the Flood, a sudden one-time drop of 225 years. This one\\n    instance is between Eber and Peleg. Eber lived 464 years while Peleg, the\\n    next named person, lived 239 years, a decline of 225 years or 61%\\n    (225/369=61%) of the total decline of human longevity after the Flood. This\\n    eye-popping decline was either produced by another catastrophe as great as\\n    the Flood or it is another Amram-Aaron case. There is no evidence for such\\n    a catastrophe 100 years after the Flood. Thus, it is another Amram-Aaron\\n    case.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The Amram-Aaron sequence leaves out an estimated 8-12 generations. The\\n    Eber-Peleg sequence leaves out as many as 55 generations. With new\\n    generations starting each 30-34 years when people lived 200-450 years, this\\n    represents up to 1900 more years of human history after the Flood than\\n    previously thought (and pushes the first man back accordingly). Since God\\n    is not more specific, we dare not violate this ambiguity. These few\\n    additional years make no difference at all in the creation-evolution\\n    controversy, but they make a world of difference in honoring Scripture\\n    because they treat both the words and numbers of Scripture as inerrant.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Once we understand what the Bible literally says, we are free to examine\\n    the findings of secular disciplines; for, sooner or later when the secular\\n    world has all the facts, it will confirm God\\'s record. So, have such\\n    findings caught up with the revelation of Scripture? The Flood changed the\\n    face of the earth up to ten miles down so it obliterated the physical\\n    evidence of human existence that would speak to the condensing of the\\n    Genesis 5 list. However, the Genesis 11 list involves the history of man\\n    after the Flood. To some extent evidence for that history still exists and\\n    is constantly being discovered through such disciplines as studies of\\n    Hebrew and related languages, textual studies, archaeology and ancient Near\\n    East history.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Adding the time represented in the missing generations between Eber and\\n    Peleg to the additional 215-years in Egypt provides enough time to\\n    encompass all well-established human history as found in written records\\n    since the Flood. Thus, getting the genealogies of Scripture right provides\\n    harmony between the words and numbers of Scripture and removes a huge\\n    stumbling block between biblical creationists and other Evangelical\\n    scholars. (See chapter seven for a full development of the abbreviation of\\n    Shem\\'s genealogy.)\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The next chapter examines the words of four witnesses to a 430-year sojourn\\n    in Egypt. In Archbishop Ussher\\'s day the text of Exodus 12:40 was\\n    deficient; so, for centuries believers held the 215-year view believing\\n    they were standing on Scripture. Over the next two centuries the text was\\n    clarified. Now eminent Hebrew scholars are unanimous-Moses clearly says the\\n    Egyptian sojourn lasted 430-years. But all along the words of God Himself\\n    to Abraham in Genesis 15:13 pointed to a 430-year sojourn in Egypt and\\n    excluded a 215-year sojourn.\\n</p>\\n<div>\\n    <br clear=\"all\" />\\n    <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\" />\\n    <div id=\"ftn1\">\\n        <p>\\n            <a href=\"\" name=\"_ftn1\" title=\"\">[1]</a>\\n            http://www.bible-researcher.com/chicago1.html\\n        </p>\\n    </div>\\n    <div id=\"ftn2\">\\n        <p>\\n            <a href=\"\" name=\"_ftn2\" title=\"\">[2]</a>\\n            Andrew E.

Clearly,\\n        the Hebrews abbreviated their genealogies. But this could only be true\\n        if Israel sojourned in Egypt 430-years and the traditional view was\\n        215, not 430-years. God, Moses, Stephen and Paul speak to the issue.\\n        Beyond doubt they testify to a 430-Year Egyptian sojourn. Consequently,\\n        this chapter must examine the testimony of these four in considerable\\n        detail because the past confusion is still bothersome. In the process\\n        it will become apparent why the 215-year option was preferred but is\\n        now obviously incorrect.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n        God Himself in Genesis 15 is the first witness. He spoke of 400 years\\n        of affliction but did not name the country where the affliction would\\n        occur. However, He did say Israel would come out of that country in the\\n        4<sup>th</sup> generation. That sounded more like 215-years than 430 to\\n        the traditionalists. The second witness, Moses, wrote about 430-years\\n        but his words could be understood as a total of 430-years between\\n        Canaan and Egypt until a corruption in the text was corrected in modern\\n        times. The third witness, Stephen, quoted God\\'s 400 years so his words\\n        fall in the same camp as God\\'s. The final witness, Paul, quoted Moses\\'\\n        430-years but his words are usually understood to be the total time in\\n        Canaan and Egypt so he was viewed as supporting 215-years.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n        Josephus, the church fathers, Ussher, the Reformers and the King James\\n        translators all held the 215-year view, but looking back, they were the\\n        victims of historical inaccuracies. Many in the inerrancy camp are\\n        still in this fog. The following will give better material for an\\n        informed view.\\n    </p>\\n    <h3>\\n        A. The Witness of God-Genesis 15:12-16\\n    </h3>\\n    <p>\\n        When Abraham was a young man, God was searching for a vessel to greatly\\n        further His work among mankind and begin a line of men who would know\\n        Him. Their descendants would eventually become a nation that declared\\n        His ways and produced both the Bible and the Messiah. The man God\\n        called was Abraham. In the beginning Abraham did not know God. He and\\n        his relatives were idol worshippers. They lived in one of the most\\n        culturally advanced cities on planet earth, but it had forsaken the\\n        knowledge of God.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n        Even yet, God appeared to him and told him to separate from his\\n        remarkable city, his many relatives, even from his father\\'s house and\\n        follow God to an undisclosed location. If he met those four conditions,\\n        God promised that his name would be great, that he would become a great\\n        nation and that in him all the earth would be blessed. Heady stuff!\\n        Eventually Abraham would fully obey so that God could fulfill His\\n        promises.\\n    </p>\\n    <h4>\\n        Need for a Covenant\\n    </h4>\\n    <p>\\n        God cannot lie because His word proceeds from His nature-perfect\\n        righteousness. All His promises to Abraham were real and would happen.\\n        However the road to becoming a great nation would be incredibly\\n        difficult and take many generations. His descendants would eventually\\n        be reduced to slavery in another land. While the promises were certain,\\n        hardships along the way might lead to despair so God reassured Abraham\\n        as well as his son Isaac and his grandson Jacob with visitation after\\n        visitation, repeating and even expanding the promises.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n        The visitation in which God disclosed the frightening news that the\\n        path involved 400 years of affliction stood above all others. In\\n        Genesis 15 God made a blood covenant, swearing by Himself alone that no\\n        matter what, He would unconditionally do what He had promised. In the\\n        vision God was saying, \"May I be like the slain animals of the covenant\\n        if I do not keep my word to you.\" There was nothing Abraham or his\\n        descendants could do to produce the results of the covenant except obey\\n        God. Fulfilling the promises would be the supernatural work of God.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n        This covenant was given about ten years after Abraham followed God to\\n        the Promised Land. Abraham and his descendants needed to have clearly\\n        in their minds that a time of fearful terror lay ahead. This horrible\\n        period would happen in another land. God would be with them and their\\n        oppression would finally end with them suddenly becoming a great and\\n        wealthy nation. As for Abraham, he would die in peace before this\\n        period of servitude began.\\n    </p>\\n    <h4>\\n        Setting for the Covenant-Genesis 15:1-11\\n    </h4>\\n    <p>\\n        Genesis 15 opens with Abraham gripped in fear. The preceding fall he\\n        had rescued Lot from the invasion of four powerful Mesopotamian armies\\n        and slaughtered its soldiers. Now it was the next spring, the time when\\n        armies went on the march. Abraham was scaring himself to death as he\\n        envisioned the certain revenge for which he was no match. In addition\\n        he had turned his back on the spoils of his victory and was being stung\\n        with criticism for such a foolish act. These thoughts left him in deep\\n        distress.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n        Then God\\'s word came to Abraham in a vision, saying \"Fear not, Abram. I\\n        am your shield; your reward shall be very great\" (Genesis 15:1). God\\n        was saying that the mightiest army in the world could not harm him\\n        because the God of creation would be his defense. In addition, God\\n        would give him a far greater reward than the spoils of Sodom he\\n        refused.\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n        Abraham had other troubling thoughts. How could he become a nation when\\n        he didn\\'t even have a son? God replied that he would have a son and his\\n        descendants would be like the stars-more numerous than he could number.\\n        Abraham asked how he could be sure this would happen. God told Abraham\\n        to cut in half a heifer, a goat and a ram and lay the halves on either\\n        side of a path. After foretelling key events of the next 700 years God\\n        alone passed between the bloody pieces of the animals thereby signing\\n        the covenant and making Him alone responsible for its fulfillment.\\n    </p>\\n    <h4>\\n        Terrifying Times Ahead - Genesis 15:12-16\\n    </h4>\\n    <p>\\n        About dusk, in his vision Abraham fell asleep. Then God made him sense\\n        the horrors his descendants would experience during a future time of\\n        servitude. That nightmare is described in Genesis 15:12 while its\\n        meaning is explained in the next four verses. Abraham\\'s offspring would\\n        be aliens in a foreign country. There they would suffer affliction 400\\n        years. But they would not be destroyed. Instead they would return to\\n        this Promised Land in great numbers and with great wealth. They could\\n        not take possession of the land yet because others were still entitled\\n        to it. But the land was Abraham\\'s and his descendants by right of\\n        divine promise. As for Abraham, this dark period would not touch him.\\n        He would die in peace. Is this indeed what these verses are saying or\\n        is the traditional explanation to be preferred?\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n        <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>\\n        <strong>\\n            As the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell on Abram. And behold,\\n            dreadful and great darkness fell upon him. <sup>13</sup>Then the\\n            LORD said to Abram, \"Know for certain that your offspring will be\\n            sojourners in a land that is not theirs and will be servants there,\\n            and they will be afflicted for four hundred years.\" Genesis\\n            15:12-13.\\n        </strong>\\n    </p>\\n    <p>\\n        Grouping these two verses together shows the terrifying sense of danger\\n        that came over Abraham and the divine explanation for it. The\\n        traditional viewpoint generally ignores the dread of verse 12 and\\n        begins with God\\'s words in verse 13. But without acknowledging the\\n        overwhelming darkness, any explanation of verse 13 will overlook its\\n        intent. The table below examines God\\'s explanation for the cause of\\n        Abraham\\'s fear. It contains six elements (left column) together with a\\n        reasonable explanation of each element. Most explanations are obvious\\n        while several may be more interpretative, but all are consistent.

They\\n    feel four generations demand a 215-year Egyptian sojourn, so they have no\\n    other choice than to wrench some of God\\'s clear statements in verse 13 as\\n    well as verses 14 and 15. Besides all this confusion in attempting a\\n    consistent interpretation, various 215-year supporters give interpretations\\n    of verses 13-16 that even disagree with each other. Clearly their\\n    explanation of Genesis 15:12-16 is inconsistent and must be rejected.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    But there is more. God continues&#8230;\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <sup>14</sup>\\n    <strong>\\n        But I will bring judgment on the nation that they serve, and afterward\\n        they shall come out with great possessions. <sup>15</sup>As for you,\\n        you shall go to your fathers in peace; you shall be buried in a good\\n        old age. <sup>16</sup>And they shall come back here in the fourth\\n        generation, for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet complete.\\n        Genesis 15:14-16.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The two assertions of verse fourteen are momentous in their own right. God\\n    would judge the nation that enslaved His people and His people would come\\n    forth from that nation with \"great possessions.\" Over 430-years Jacob\\'s\\n    small band multiplied to a population of several million. Then, when God\\n    ordered the oppressing nation to free His people which it refused to do, He\\n    sent ten devastating plagues of judgment. With that, the oppressors urged\\n    His people to leave before they all perished and sent them away with\\n    valuable gifts. A few days later, the nation had a change of heart and sent\\n    its chariot army to bring the Hebrews back. God thwarted this effort by\\n    destroying their military force in the waters of the Red Sea.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    All this happened in the land of Egypt. Egypt was not promised to the\\n    Hebrews but was the land in which they would become servants, the land\\n    where they would be afflicted four hundred years. Egypt was the nation God\\n    would judge and its wealth would enrich His people.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    God spends all of verse 15 with words of assurance to Abraham-he would not\\n    endure the grueling slavery destined for his descendants. While it might be\\n    possible to argue that verse 13 implies the affliction would touch Abraham\\n    as well, God clearly rules out Abraham\\'s participation in this sojourn of\\n    servitude with these key phrases: \"As for you,\" \"go to your fathers in\\n    peace,\" and \"buried in a good old age.\" In the light of these words, it is\\n    hard to understand how the traditional view can insist that Abraham shared\\n    in the affliction of verse thirteen.\\n</p>\\n<h4>\\n    Three momentous assertions by Jehovah\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>\\n        And they shall come back here in the fourth generation, for the\\n        iniquity of the Amorites is not yet complete. Genesis 15:16.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    1. \"And they shall come back here.\" Hundreds of years of affliction, some\\n    involving grinding slavery would not annihilate Abraham\\'s descendants. They\\n    would be given the Promised Land just as Jehovah had covenanted.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    2. \"In the fourth generation.\" God did not give a vague promise of a return\\n    \"someday.\" This specific time marker would constantly provide hope during\\n    the period of affliction.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    3. \"For the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet complete.\" Amorites\\n    occupied the land God promised Abraham. While God is longsuffering, there\\n    is a point where a people group has advanced so deeply into sin that hardly\\n    anyone in it can get come to know Him. Thus, He must remove that entire\\n    people group. God saw the direction and result of their iniquity. It was\\n    headed towards the place where justice would obligate Him to remove them.\\n    Once their iniquity was complete they surrendered their right to the land\\n    and God was free to give it to others. God would remove the populous\\n    city-state of Sodom just years later for this very reason; there weren\\'t\\n    even ten righteous in it. So verse 16 provided another reason for the\\n    lengthy stay in Egypt and thus the need for patience until the right time\\n    arrived.\\n</p>\\n<h4>\\n    Genesis 15:16-Fourth Generation Promise\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\n    The statements about returning to Canaan and the Amorites\\' iniquity are\\n    clear and understandable but what did God mean by His statement that they\\n    would return in the fourth generation? It means, says the majority view,\\n    the fourth generation of Israelites in Egypt would return to Canaan. They\\n    claim this proves a 215-year Egyptian sojourn and eliminates a 430-year\\n    Egyptian sojourn, since four generations could reach 215-years, but not\\n    430-years. They point to Exodus six which names four generations ending\\n    with Moses and Aaron who participated in the Exodus (passage cited below).\\n    Exodus six records that Levi had a son named Kohath. Kohath had a son named\\n    Amram and Amram had two sons, Moses and Aaron. The four generations were\\n    Levi, Kohath, Amram and Aaron. While this explanation requires strained\\n    explanations for a dozen other details in Genesis 15:12-16 it is the only\\n    way, they say.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    But this idea doesn\\'t work because Aaron had four grown sons at the time of\\n    the Exodus. If Levi-Kohath-Amram-Aaron were the right four generations, God\\n    did not keep His promise. To make matters worse Exodus six also names\\n    Aaron\\'s grandson, Phinehas, who possibly was born in Egypt. Maybe Levi\\'s\\n    line came out in the sixth generation. Others have recognized this problem\\n    and attempted to identify four other generations, but none work. The fact\\n    is, the four generations can\\'t be found if \"fourth generation\" is\\n    interpreted as four consecutive father-son generations. The critical verses\\n    are found in Exodus 6:16, 18, 20, 23 and 25:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <sup>16</sup>\\n    <strong>\\n        These are the names of the sons of <u>Levi</u> according to their\\n        generations: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari, the years of the life of Levi\\n        being 137 years. <sup>18</sup>The sons of <u>Kohath</u>: Amram, Izhar,\\nHebron, and Uzziel, the years of the life of Kohath being 133 years.        <sup>20</sup><u>Amram</u> took as his wife Jockebed his father\\'s\\n        sister, and she bore him <u>Aaron</u> and Moses, the years of the life\\n        of Amram being 137 years. <sup>23</sup>Aaron took as his wife Elisheba,\\nthe daughter of Amminadab and the sister of Nahshon, and she bore him        <u>Nadab, Abihu</u>, <u>Eleazar, and Ithamar</u>. <sup>25</sup>Eleazar,\\n        Aaron\\'s son, took as his wife one of the daughters of Putiel, and she\\n        bore him <u>Phinehas</u>. (Emphasis ours.)\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    \"Coming out in the fourth generation\" also raises the question, \"How many\\n    years elapsed from the start of one generation to the start of the next?\\n    While many years elapsed in the generations of Terah, Abraham, Isaac and\\n    Jacob, beginning with Jacob\\'s sons new generations generally started every\\n    20 to 30 years. At that rate four generations would place the deliverance\\n    in 80 to 120 years (20x4=80; 30x4=120). Such a time frame even falls short\\n    of 215-years in Egypt. Further, God does not say four special generations\\n    but simply four generations. Everyone could count the generations in his\\n    family and expect deliverance when the number reached four.\\n</p>\\n<h4>\\n    \"Generations\" as \"Lifetimes\"\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\n    If a way could be found to harmonize the \"either/or\" verses, it would be a\\n    \"both/and\" victory for inerrancy. All the verses and each statement of each\\n    verse could be embraced without qualification, without diminishing, without\\n    violating inerrancy. We suggest that way is in a full understanding of the\\n    Hebrew concept of genealogies. It is much broader than in other cultures.\\n    Here the generations would be lifetimes-Israel would come out in four\\n    lifetimes, or in the fourth lifetime. Add up four known lifetimes and\\n    before the end of the fourth, Israel would come out of Egypt.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Moses wrote these words. He must have puzzled over what God had told\\n    Abraham 600 years before. He doesn\\'t identify four successive generations\\n    (the 215-year interpretation) but he does provide the numbers to make the\\n    idea of \"lifetimes\" work. He lists 40 men in the genealogies of Exodus six\\n    but amazingly he only records the ages of three: Levi-137 years (6:16);\\n    Kohath-133 years (6:18) and Amram-137 years (6:20). Their ages added\\n    together total 407 years. In the next chapter Moses wrote, \"Now Moses was\\n    eighty years old and Aaron eighty-three years old when they spoke to\\n    Pharaoh\" (Exodus 7:7). Those confrontations produced the Exodus. Adding\\n    those 83 years to the 407 years gives a total of 490 years, which more than\\n    covers a 430-year Egyptian sojourn (137+133+137+83=490). So a perfectly\\n    satisfactory interpretation is that in the total of four lifetimes or in\\n    the fourth lifetime Israel would come out.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    This interpretation allows each of the dozen details in Genesis 15:12-16 to\\n    be taken at face value, in their normal meaning. It completely upholds the\\n    principle of inerrancy. God had promised the affliction would end at a\\n    certain time and that the outcome would be marvelous. Under this\\n    interpretation the end of Israel\\'s servitude in Egypt would come in just\\n    four lifetimes.\\n</p>\\n<h4>\\n    Accepting the Witness of God\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\n    God Himself is the first speaker in Scripture to address the years of\\n    sojourn in Egypt. He said Abraham\\'s descendants would be afflicted in a\\n    land that was not theirs. Nearly all acknowledge this to be referring to\\n    Egypt. He said affliction in that land would continue for 400 years. Since\\n    400 years is clearly more than 215-years, God\\'s statement eliminates the\\n    traditional 215-year view. While the 215-year folks quickly fall back to\\n    Moses statement about Israel\\'s stay in Egypt in Exodus 12:40, we will show\\n    next that Moses statement does not support their view either.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Some see God\\'s 400 year statement and Moses 430-year statement as a\\n    conflict and then imply that it is impossible to know for sure what is\\n    being said. This conflict is resolved once one recalls that Moses was\\n    talking about Israel\\'s total time in Egypt which began with welcome, while\\n    God was speaking about the portion of time in Egypt after the welcome wore\\n    off and was characterized by affliction. The number 400 is also more\\n    general and could suggest that the time of affliction was introduced over a\\n    period of time. God\\'s statement agrees with Moses\\' 430-years statement but\\n    rejects a 215-year Egyptian stay.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    God is not only the first speaker in Scripture to address the issue but He\\n    is speaking specifically about the length of time in Egypt. Further, He is\\n    the most important speaker in all of Scripture. In just five words, the\\n    first five words of Scripture, \"In the beginning God created,\" He settled\\n    the creation/evolution issue. Certainly in five verses He could settle the\\n    215/430-year issue. As we shall soon see, the position of the traditional\\n    view only seems to worsen.\\n</p>\\n<h3>\\n    B. The Witness of Moses-Exodus 12:40-41\\n</h3>\\n<p>\\n    So, how does Moses weigh in on the subject? After all, he was there. Under\\n    the LORD he led Israel out of Egypt. Maybe we have missed something, but\\n    his words seem clear. In Exodus 12:40-41 he states:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <sup>40</sup>\\n    <strong>\\nThe time that the people of Israel lived in Egypt was 430-years.        <sup>41</sup>At the end of 430-years, on that very day, all the hosts\\n        of the LORD went out from the land of Egypt.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The Hebrew text of verse forty was not always clear. In the days of Sir\\n    Isaac Newton, Archbishop James Ussher, and the translation of the King\\n    James Version there were long standing questions about the text. The\\n    Septuagint gave the translation \"lived in Egypt and Canaan.\" Josephus took\\n    that view. As a result the nearly universal view of Christians 400 years\\n    ago was that the 430-year sojourn included both the years in Canaan and in\\n    Egypt. This is where the idea came from that 215 of the 430-year sojourn\\n    were spent in Canaan by Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Newton, Ussher and the\\n    King James translators were all products of their age and expressed the\\n    understanding of their day.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Over the next two centuries textual scholars worked to resolve the\\n    difficulties with the text. By the late 1800\\'s Robert Jamieson of the six\\n    volume Jamieson-Fausset-Brown commentary series could say that hardly any\\n    Hebrew scholar of eminence still accepted the corrupted text that allowed\\n    for understanding that the 430-years spanned the time Abraham and his\\ndescendants lived in the Promised Land and in Egypt.    <a href=\"#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\" title=\"\">[2]</a> Today even those few\\n    eminent Hebraists are history. Only the incorrect translation of 1611 and\\n    its successors remain to uphold the faulty interpretation. Those who still\\n    teach that Israel sojourned in Egypt just 215-years reject hundreds of\\n    years of work to determine the correct text. Today\\'s translations such as\\n    the ESV used in this book (Exodus 12:40 cited above) clearly state that\\n    Israel sojourned in Egypt 430-years.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Many have unwittingly clung to the incorrect view of Newton and Ussher\\'s\\n    day. What are the authorities saying today?

The period of time began when Jacob went\\n        to Egypt at the end of his life. The Bible is also very clear when God\\n        said \"your descendants\" will be strangers for 430 [sic, 400] years. It\\n        is a no brainer to me. Of course I realize that there are all kinds of\\n        higher criticism people who question all of the Bible chronology,\\n        including the timing of the Exodus, but again it seems to me that the\\n        Bible is the final authority and speaks quite clearly on the subject of\\n        timing\\n    </strong>\\n    .<a href=\"#_ftn3\" name=\"_ftnref3\" title=\"\">[3]</a>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Since the subject is Jewish history, it would seem that of all people\\n    living today, Jews would have the most accurate understanding of their\\n    history.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Dr. C.F.

They have no bearing on the Hebrew\\n    text.

The Witness of Stephen-Acts 7\\n</h3>\\n<p>\\n    God\\'s revelation in Genesis 15 was given to Abraham 4000 years ago. Moses\\'\\n    record in Exodus was prepared 3400 years ago. Long after the words of God\\n    and Moses, the New Testament also spoke to the years in Egypt. The church\\'s\\n    first martyr, Stephen, before being stoned, declared:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <sup>6</sup>\\n    <strong>\\n        And God spoke to this effect-that his [Abraham\\'s] offspring would be\\n        sojourners in a land belonging to others, who would enslave them and\\n        afflict them four hundred years. <sup>7</sup>\"But I will judge the\\n        nation that they serve,\" said God, \"and after that they shall come out\\n        and worship me in this place.\" Acts 7:6-7.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Stephen, \"a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit,\" (Acts 6:5) was\\n    citing God\\'s words to Abraham in Genesis 15:13-14. The common elements\\n    agree-the subject is Abraham\\'s descendants who would be living as aliens in\\n    a land God had not promised them; they would be enslaved and this\\n    affliction would last 400 years. Stephen unwittingly disclosed that in 2000\\n    years the belief of Jewry had not changed. After all that time they still\\n    understood God to be saying that the sojourn in Egypt would involve 400\\n    years of affliction.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    We have already seen how the traditional view feels compelled to find other\\n    explanations for God\\'s seemingly clear words to Abraham in Genesis 15. But\\n    reinterpreting Stephen\\'s words to mean something else would be very\\n    difficult. So, what does the traditional view do with Stephen\\'s testimony?\\n    They say Acts 7 is exactly what he said. Then they add that inerrancy only\\n    guarantees what a person says, not the accuracy of what is said. They say\\n    that this man whom Scripture says was full of the Holy Spirit misspoke. He\\n    was under pressure and/or was confused, so his words cannot necessarily be\\n    accepted as factual. On the contrary, Stephen must be added to the\\n    witnesses to a 430-year Egyptian sojourn. Now three consecutive witnesses\\n    in Scripture testify to the larger sojourn number.\\n</p>\\n<h3>\\n    D. The Witness of Paul-Galatians 3:17\\n</h3>\\n<p>\\n    While Stephen is the New Testament witness to the 400-year number God gave\\n    to Abraham, the Apostle Paul is the New Testament witness to the 430-year\\n    number given by Moses:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>\\n        This is what I mean: the law, which came 430-years afterward, does not\\n        annul a covenant previously ratified by God, so as to make the promise\\n        void. Galatians 3:17.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Without question this is the traditional view\\'s favorite verse. \"Here is\\n    absolute proof\" they say, \"that the 430-years began when God first appeared\\n    to Abraham and ended with the Exodus.\" They say God made the promises of\\n    Genesis 12:1-3 to Abraham when he was living in Haran. He immediately\\n    obeyed God\\'s call and moved to Canaan. Then 430-years later the law was\\n    given at the time of the Exodus. Therefore the 430-years began when Abraham\\n    moved to Canaan and ended with the Exodus. The 430-years consisted of the\\n    years of sojourning in Canaan plus those in Egypt. Since Abraham, Isaac and\\n    Jacob sojourned in Canaan 215-years, the remaining 215-years was the time\\n    of sojourning in Egypt.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The traditional view cites Paul\\'s authority. Because he wrote more of the\\n    New Testament than any other writer and his books contain the heart of\\n    Christian doctrine, he outranks all other writers of Scripture. If there is\\n    some confusion between the Old Testament and the Apostle, one must prefer\\n    the Apostle. They suggest that possibly the Old Testament isn\\'t clear, but\\n    the Apostle is perfectly clear and he is the final authority. Thus the\\n    traditional view stands with the Apostle-the entire sojourn in Canaan and\\n    Egypt lasted 430-years, period, end of discussion.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    When this view leads the discussion, it doesn\\'t start with the very words\\n    of the LORD Himself in Genesis 15, but immediately starts with Galatians\\n    3:17 and then reinterprets the words of Stephen, Moses and Jehovah to agree\\n    with Paul. But which is better: to start with the primary sources, Jehovah\\n    and Moses, then work to the secondary sources in the New Testament, or\\n    start with one secondary source, work on the other secondary source and\\n    then rework the primary sources?\\n</p>\\n<h4>\\n    Reconciling Paul with God, Moses and Stephen\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\n    Nevertheless, every knowing Christian takes very seriously what the Apostle\\n    wrote. What, then, are we to do with Paul\\'s words? First we should observe\\n    that the subject of both God and of Moses was the number of years in Egypt;\\n    Stephen and Paul were addressing other subjects. Stephen\\'s point was that\\n    Israel\\'s leaders historically rejected God\\'s messengers. So he specifically\\n    quoted God\\'s words to Abraham as he reminded his hearers that God had\\n    raised up the nation to sovereignly accomplish His will even though His\\n    will was constantly resisted.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Paul, like Stephen, was not discussing how many years Israel sojourned in\\n    Egypt. He was showing that God\\'s grace preceded God\\'s Law. In his argument\\n    He cited a number every Jew would know-the 430-year number. It was repeated\\n    annually in the Passover celebration. Paul\\'s point was that the Law did not\\n    finally make a way for man to have a right relationship with God. God dealt\\n    with the forefathers of Israel in grace from the beginning, long before the\\n    law. That grace is seen in the promises and covenant God gave to Abraham,\\n    Isaac and Jacob. All this promise/covenant development happened 430-years\\n    before God gave Israel the Law.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    If there was no standing before God until the Law, the promises were\\n    meaningless and all the Jewish people who lived before the giving of the\\n    law missed out on a right relationship with God. The 430-year number was a\\n    powerful argument for grace rather than law. Yet the Galatian believers\\n    were being told that they needed to keep the Mosaic Law to enjoy God\\'s\\n    blessings. So, Paul argued that God established promises and a covenant\\n    with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Then 430-years later He gave the Law. In\\n    this way, Paul agrees with God, Moses and Stephen in supporting 430-years\\n    in Egypt.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    It should also be noted that since God\\'s and Moses\\' core subject was the\\n    time in Egypt while Stephen\\'s and Paul\\'s core subjects were other matters,\\n    God and Moses should be preferred over Stephen and Paul. But since\\n    Stephen\\'s words agree with God\\'s words, only Paul can be viewed to be at\\n    odds with the other three. Rather than working on the words of the other\\n    three witnesses, many of which are not subject to another interpretation,\\n    shouldn\\'t the first consideration be, \"Can Paul\\'s rather general words can\\n    be understood in another light?\"\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Proceeding on that basis-one insight would be Paul\\'s reference to covenant.\\n    God did not give Abraham a covenant when He called him. The covenant was\\n    not made until Abraham had been in the land about ten years-shortly before\\n    Abraham took Hagar to give Sarah a child. If Paul were talking about the\\n    time from the Covenant to the Law, he should have said 420 years, not\\n    430-years. On the other hand if the call came to Abraham when he was living\\n    in Ur, not when his father died in Haran, then the time from the call to\\n    the Law would have been greater than 430-years. (The next chapter shows\\n    that the call came in Ur, not Haran.)\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    But Paul is not speaking about Abraham\\'s call. He is speaking about the\\n    promises which foreshadow Jesus Christ and the salvation God would provide\\n    through Him. These promises were amplified over time to Abraham, then to\\n    his son Isaac and finally to his grandson Jacob. They were sworn to by God\\n    Himself in the covenant of Genesis 15.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Joseph invited his father to move to Egypt where there was food because\\n    five years of famine remained. Jacob accepted. He took his household as far\\n    as Beersheba in Southern Israel, but then he hesitated. Previously it had\\n    not been God\\'s will for him, his father or grandfather to leave the\\n    Promised Land. Jacob offered sacrifices. In a vision God gave him assurance\\n    to continue to Egypt.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>\\n    <strong>\\n        So Israel took his journey with all that he had and came to Beersheba,\\n        and offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac. <sup> 2</sup>And\\n        God spoke to Israel in visions of the night and said, \"Jacob, Jacob.\"\\n        And he said, \"Here I am.\" <sup>3</sup>Then he said, \"I am God, the God\\n        of your father. Do not be afraid to go down to Egypt, for there I will\\n        make you into a great nation. <sup>4</sup>I myself will go down with\\n        you to Egypt, and I will also bring you up again, and Joseph\\'s hand\\n        shall close your eyes.\" Genesis 46:1-4.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    In this passage God restates and amplifies the promises for the final time\\n    before the sojourn in Egypt. On this night the promise-making period that\\n    began with God\\'s call to Abraham concluded; the next day Jacob moved his\\n    people to Egypt. So the promises were given, restated and expanded over\\n    more than 215-years. After the promises (this promise-making period) came\\n    the 430-year sojourn in Egypt. Following this came the giving of the Law at\\n    Mount Sinai. Thus sandwiched in between the development of the promises and\\n    the giving of the Law were those 430-years in Egypt. First came years of\\n    making the promises/covenant. Then came the 430-year sojourn in Egypt.\\n    Following that God gave Israel the Law at Mount Sinai. Thus, from the [end\\n    of the] promise and covenant making period to the law was precisely\\n    430-years. Paul was not contradicting the words of Moses but was actually\\n    confirming them. This interpretation fits perfectly with the testimonies of\\n    the other three witnesses.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    So which is better? To make Paul\\'s words of a very general nature to agree\\n    with the specific words of the other three witnesses or to make all the\\n    words of the three witnesses agree with one interpretation of when the\\n    430-years in Paul\\'s statement began? Logically, the first approach seems\\n    preferable. Thus, it is sound hermeneutics to understand that Paul\\'s words\\n    agree with those of God, Moses and Stephen. The New Testament confirms the\\n    words of God in Stephen\\'s message to the leaders of Israel and the words of\\n    Moses in Paul\\'s argument to the Galatians. In contrast to the traditional\\n    215-year view, the Bible gives no less than four passages to emphasize that\\n    it was 430-years that Israel sojourned in Egypt. All the statements and\\n    numbers in these four passages are harmonized without conflict. Inerrancy\\n    is honored.\\n</p>\\n<h4>\\n    Path to Violating Scripture\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\n    In retrospect, where did the practice of preferring numbers to words begin?\\n    As stated in the previous chapter, it all began when people, thinking they\\n    were taking the Bible literally, added the numbers in Levi\\'s line and\\n    realized that Amram could not possibly be the immediate father of Aaron if\\n    Israel were in Egypt 430-years. They eventually concluded the 430-years\\n    referred to the entire time from Abraham\\'s arrival in Canaan until the\\n    Exodus. That left just 215-years in Egypt. It was possible for Amram to be\\n    the immediate father of Aaron if Israel were in Egypt just 215-years. But\\n    unfortunately the obvious meaning of many other words of Scripture would\\n    need to be reinterpreted in difficult and unnatural ways.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Why do all that to Scripture when it is clear that Hebrew genealogies can\\n    be as narrow as Adam begetting Cain or as broad as Jesus being the son of\\n    David? When one recognizes the nature and function of Hebrew genealogies,\\n    the record of Amram begetting Aaron is obviously a skipping of multiple\\n    generations. It is the broad sense of Amram being a forefather of Aaron, of\\n    Aaron coming from the loins of Amram. Once this is understood, the\\n    Scriptures become whole, no contradictions, no errors, no explaining away\\n    clear verses, no ignoring difficult verses.\\n</p>\\n<h4>\\n    Conclusion Number One: Israel Dwelt in Egypt 430-years\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\n    The debate over whether Israel dwelt in Egypt 430 or 215-years is not\\n    between those who accept the Bible and those who question the Bible. Both\\n    sides believe the Bible is inerrant and the final authority. Motive\\n    distinguishes the two positions. 430-years didn\\'t work with an uninformed\\n    view of the genealogies, so long ago the traditional view found a way to\\n    cut the 430-years down to 215. Today, the typical Evangelical Christian has\\n    never heard the 215-year view taught or even talked about. When he reads\\n    about those who reduce the 430-year Egyptian sojourn, he is shocked. He\\n    asks, \"How could anyone who claims to honor Scripture treat it with such\\n    callousness?\"\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    He might even reexamine what Scripture actually says and find that four\\n    authors address the subject. The first author is no less than God Himself\\n    who promised to make Abraham a great nation but warned that the path to\\n    nationhood would involve exploitation and servitude. To give hope God\\n    revealed that difficult time would end in 400 years. Centuries later Moses\\n    wrote a description of the deliverance from Egypt and said that the\\n    deliverance came 430-years to the day after Israel went down to Egypt.\\n    While God\\'s 400 years only spoke about the affliction time in Egypt, he\\n    would realize that Moses\\' 430-years referred to the entire time in Egypt\\n    which included a period at the beginning when Jacob\\'s family was given good\\n    land and was not afflicted. Thus, the two periods, 400 and 430, were\\n    actually the overall period and then a period within the overall period.\\n    They were true periods, each supporting the other. Thus, no less than God\\n    and Moses attested to 430-years in Egypt.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    He comes to the New Testament which states both the 400 year and 430-year\\n    numbers. Stephen rehearsed Israel\\'s history and quoted God\\'s statement\\n    about 400 years of affliction in a land belonging to others while Paul\\n    cited Moses 430-year statement as the time from the making of promises and\\n    covenant to the giving of the Mosaic Law during the first year of\\n    wilderness wandering. Thus he finds that both the Old and New Testaments\\n    attest to 430-years in Egypt. With his study completed, he concludes,\\n    \"Certainly the testimony of these authorities should be adequate. If not,\\n    how can a Christian trust anything Scripture says?\"\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Motivation also tests the two interpretations. True motivation attempts to\\n    determine what the passages in question say. The 430 view is motivated by\\n    this desire while the 215 view is motivated by a desire to reduce the\\n    430-years in some way. If there are compelling reasons to understand a\\n    passage in some other way than its normal meaning, it may be necessary to\\n    explore the subject passages in unconventional ways. But if not, such\\n    tampering must be avoided. The 215-year view has no such compelling reason.\\n    Four hundred thirty years is not harmful to Scripture. Instead, it is\\n    beneficial because it forces the interpreter to take the genealogies as\\n    they were meant to be taken. Finally, while four authors support the\\n    430-year number, nowhere does a single author of Scripture suggest or imply\\n    Israel was in Egypt only 215-years.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    While trying to avoid being dogmatic, we are stating what appears to most\\n    to be obvious. It appears that beyond question Israel\\'s sojourn in Egypt\\n    lasted 430-years. To say otherwise is to teach something the Scripture\\n    simply never says and to deny what the Scripture says multiple times. Two\\n    hundred fifteen and years dishonors Scripture. It is not the way that\\n    inerrancy treats Scripture. Once a person has a clear understanding of the\\n    four witnesses\\' testimonies, a 430-year sojourn in Egypt can no longer be\\n    disputed.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    This 430-year number is like a brick wall. All those who throw themselves\\n    against it only injure themselves while the wall stands. Hopefully they\\n    will give glory to God who has revealed clearly a 430-year sojourn in Egypt\\n    and abandon this longstanding distraction.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    A 430-year Egyptian sojourn would seemingly push Ussher\\'s date for the\\n    Flood back 215-years, from 2348 BC to 2563 BC (in truth it doesn\\'t because\\n    of other errors). This will make the historians and archaeologists a little\\n    happier since they find much human activity during that span. However, if\\n    the people who emphasize numbers over words in Scripture have made other\\n    errors in their calculations, the 2563 BC number will need further\\n    correcting.\\n</p>\\n<h4>\\n    Conclusion Number Two: Genealogies May be Abbreviated\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\n    Chapter one showed that a 430-year sojourn in Egypt would require\\n    understanding that the Levi-Aaron line of Exodus chapter six was\\n    abbreviated. This chapter shows that beyond doubt Israel did sojourn in\\n    Egypt 430-years. These two facts raise two alternatives: either the Bible\\n    is in error at this point or the Levi-Aaron genealogy is abbreviated. The\\n    first alternative is both unacceptable and unnecessary. Therefore, the only\\n    other alternative must be accepted: their genealogy is selective rather\\n    than comprehensive.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Such a conclusion is a stumbling block to some. But it need not be. When\\n    they examine the many ways Scripture uses genealogies, they will realize\\n    that Exodus six acceptably and accurately uses Hebrew genealogies. This\\n    insight will be a momentous advance for those who cherish Scripture as\\n    God-breathed.\\n</p>\\n<h4>\\n    Looking Ahead\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\n    God, Moses, Stephen, Paul-four witnesses. Are four enough? In Deuteronomy\\n    17:6 the very life of a person rested in the hands of just two or three\\n    witnesses. If someone turned to idolatry God said to put them to death on\\n    the evidence of two or three witnesses. This principle regarding the\\n    required number of witnesses to establish a fact carried through to the New\\n    Testament church. Paul said that two or three witnesses were necessary to\\n    establish a charge against an elder (I Timothy 5:19). The testimony of four\\n    witnesses more than meets the biblical requirement for establishing the\\n    truth.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Having established by four witnesses that Israel dwelt in Egypt 430-years\\n    and therefore the Levi-Aaron genealogy of Exodus six is abbreviated, our\\n    initial goal has been reached. While we could end here, some may still\\n    believe Abraham\\'s call came in Haran and therefore three witness for\\n    430-years while one witnesses for 215-years. We will next examine extensive\\n    evidence for that call coming in Ur, not Haran, leaving all four witnesses\\n    solidly in the 430-year Egyptian sojourn camp. Then we will take a careful\\n    look at Jacob\\'s life to correct details which have also been altered to fit\\n    the numbers over words approach. In effect this book provides a fresh look\\n    at some of the key moments in the lives of Abraham and Jacob, a prize for\\n    those wanting to correct mistaken notions regarding aspects of their lives.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Once these interpretations are addressed, we can get to the heart of this\\n    paper, a look at the nature and function of Hebrew genealogies.

For his words to have this meaning, God's call\\n    had to come when Abraham was living in Haran, a position that is fatally\\n    flawed. Such an idea comes both from misinterpreting the Scriptural record\\n    of certain events and oversimplifying how God was preparing Abraham for a\\n    life of faith. Yet the subject is complex and is not settled with a few\\n    simple proof texts.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    This chapter begins by noting the many contributions to Abraham's total\\n    life story in those first 75 years overlooked by Ussher and his followers.\\n    In the process most readers will gain an entirely new appreciation for this\\n    one whom God used to found the Jewish people and birth our Savior. Those\\n    years were not unlike the early years of Moses, Paul, Joseph and David\\n    whose stops and starts laid groundworks for their future ministries.\\n    Understanding these puts flesh on the bones of Abraham's life of growing\\n    faith. Although sinning and doubting along the way, this man who worshipped\\n    idols in Ur with his kindred, (Joshua 24:2) came to build altars to the one\\n    and only true God in Haran so that when he arrived in Canaan his first\\n    response was to build an altar (Genesis 12:7-8). How did that happen?\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    When the call came in Ur, even Abraham's idolatrous father must have been\\n    awed by his son's claims that if he followed the true God's leading, God\\n    would make of him a great nation and in him all the families of the earth\\n    would be blessed (Genesis 12:2-3). Apparently once Terah realized that he\\n    could not talk his son out of this insane plan to walk away from his life\\n    in Ur, he began to wonder if maybe God did appear to him after all. Terah\\n    had taken delight in his son's impressive achievements in Ur and had the\\n    strongest confidence in this only son still in his household. In the end,\\n    with his final years looming, his only option was to accompany his son\\n    although some of this remains a mystery. We can only surmise but history\\n    points to difficult times ahead for Ur. God often uses circumstances in His\\n    leading. Perhaps in this case the winds of war were already in the air.\\n    Whew, away from that!\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Along the journey the family most likely questioned Abraham: what next? God\\n    had said \\\"to go to the land that I will show you\\\" (Genesis 12:1). Hebrews\\n    11:8 concurs:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>\\n        By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to a place that he\\n        was to receive as an inheritance. And he went out, not knowing where he\\n        was going.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    In a way not explained by Scripture God was showing Abraham where to go\\n    just as He had said. At each fork somehow God led him. As they journeyed\\n    from Ur Abraham confidently told his party whether to go left, right or\\n    straight ahead. Because this went on for nearly two months Abraham's party\\n    must have felt better and better about the move with each passing day. Then\\n    suddenly about 700 miles from Ur Abraham didn't know which way to go.\\n    Whatever method God used to lead him stopped, vanished, disappeared into\\n    thin air. So there they waited and waited. Not a sign, not a hint from God.\\n    Finally, after some days, heavy with disappointment, they began to discuss\\n    what went wrong. Abraham knew-while he had separated from his country and\\n    relatives, he had not separated from his father's idolatrous household. Now\\n    what?\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The decision was made to settle in Haran. Scripture doesn't tell how far\\n    Haran was from where the leading stopped but it does report that \\\"when they\\n    came to Haran, they settled there\\\" (Genesis 11:31) even though they\\n    eventually learned that the destination was Canaan. After all this divine\\n    leading and the visitation that triggered it, Abraham would never be the\\n    same. Now he knew there was a great difference between the idolatrous gods\\n    of Ur and the true God who spoke to him in Ur and led him as far as Haran.\\n    He must know this true God. Information was available to those so motivated\\n    and Abraham began to gather that information and seek this God. With the\\n    passing of time he began to worship this true God. He began to build altars\\n    as those before him who worshipped the true God had done.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    For the next 10 or 15 years Abraham got to know the true God better and\\n    better and worshiped at the altar more and more frequently. This in itself\\n    is remarkable but another remarkable thing began to happen. The members of\\n    Terah's household began joining Abraham at the altar. Eventually,\\n    apparently Terah's entire household worshiped at the altar. He was in his\\n    final days and now totally dependent on his son. Very possibly before the\\n    end he also joined with the others at Abraham's altar. Oh, how marvelous\\n    was the grace of God in allowing this family situation to play out in Haran\\n    over those years.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The proof for all this is the large evidence of faith demonstrated by\\n    Abraham's household once they reached Canaan-immediately worshipping at\\n    altars upon arrival, ascribing faith to Lot (II Peter 2:7), choosing for\\n    Hebron and the suicidal mission of rescuing Lot from the invasion of the\\n    Mesopotamian armies.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Abraham's Place in the Birth Order of Terah's Sons</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Piecing together those 75 years before the move to Canaan requires solving\\n    the issue of birth order of Terah's three sons. Stephen said that Abraham\\n    moved to Canaan after Terah died (Acts 7:4). He died at the age of 205\\n    (Genesis 11:32). Since Abraham arrived in Canaan at the age of 75 (Genesis\\n    12:4), he was born when Terah was 130 years old (205-75=130). Because Terah\\n    began fathering his three sons when he was 70, Abraham had a brother who\\n    was 60 years his senior (130-70=60).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    But Abraham is generally considered the oldest son. Twice Scripture names\\n    Terah's three sons and in both cases the order is Abraham, Nahor and Haran\\n    (Genesis 11:26, 27). People assume the sons are named in the order of their\\n    birth. While this is the normal practice of Scripture, sometimes it names\\n    sons in the order of their importance or impact in the plan of God. Such is\\n    the case here. Abraham would touch the entire world. Nahor would supply\\n    wives to Abraham's descendants. Haran died in relative obscurity. As to why\\n    the three brothers were born over a period of 60 years, Terah apparently\\n    had a fertility problem. This explanation seems reasonable because his\\n    daughter Sarah was barren, his granddaughter Rebekah also was barren and\\n    even his great-granddaughter Rachel was barren.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    As to the ages of Abraham's two brothers, Nahor and Haran, Scripture\\n    provides important hints to work with. First, Nahor married Haran's\\n    daughter Milcah. Second, Haran's name suggests Terah enjoyed business\\n    success at the trade route town by that name before moving to Ur. Third,\\n    Haran died before Abraham left Ur. These three details point to Haran being\\n    older than Nahor. When was Nahor born? He had eight sons by Haran's\\n    daughter and was no longer living with his father when God called Abraham.\\n    Further Abraham was attached to Lot, the son of Haran, not his brother\\n    Nahor. These details indicate Nahor would have been 30 or 40 years older\\n    than Abraham. Now a possible picture emerges: Haran was born when Terah was\\n    70. Nahor was born 20-40 years later. Abraham was the youngest brother,\\n    born 60 years after Haran.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    More details emerge. Abraham married his father's daughter by a second\\n    wife. Sarah was ten years younger than Abraham. They were married long\\n    enough in Ur to discover that unlike her sister-in-law, she was barren.\\n    This seems to indicate that Abraham lived many adult years in Ur. The age\\n    for adulthood was 25 at the time. Possibly Abraham married Sarah once she\\n    reached that age. Then, 25-30 years of marriage would be adequate to\\n    realize that Sarah could not have children and would place the call of God\\n    when Abraham was 60 or 65. If so, Haran died by the age of 130 or 135 and\\n    Terah was 190 or 195. Living 35-40 adult years in Ur allowed Abraham to\\n    learn and achieve much and drink deeply from Ur's culture while 10-15 years\\n    of mature adult life in Haran would have been enough time to become wealthy\\n    both materially and spiritually .\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Nephew Older Than Uncle</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    With Lot's father 60 years older than Abraham and Lot's sister marrying\\n    Abraham's other brother, Lot himself must have been some years older than\\n    Abraham. Does this fit the context? Actually, Lot being older than Abraham\\n    makes better sense of what Scripture reveals of their relationship. One\\n    gets the impression that Abraham was more attached to Lot than Lot was to\\n    Abraham which would be expected if Lot were older than Abraham.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Abraham's real older brother, Nahor, was preoccupied with a growing family.\\n    Meanwhile Lot continued to live in the household of his grandfather. So\\n    Lot, not Nahor, became the \\\"big brother\\\" figure in Abraham's life. This\\n    bonding would be a new explanation for why Abraham was so loyal to him and\\n    would also explain why Abraham offered Lot first choice of the land when\\n    they separated (Genesis 13). It would further explain how Lot could go his\\n    separate way and seek out Sodom rather than staying close to Abraham. He\\n    thought for himself. He had his own views. He did what he pleased. In\\n    summary, if Lot were the elder, he would have been something of a big\\n    brother in Abraham's childhood and this early relationship colored\\n    Abraham's relationship with him in adulthood.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    As to Terah, he was becoming infirm and dependent on others. His oldest son\\n    was dead and the other was living on his own. Abraham was the only son left\\n    to care for him when God's call came. As it played out, this youngest son\\n    and his daughter cared for Terah until his death. These also became the\\n    obvious heirs to Terah's household along with Lot who must have received an\\n    inheritance in place of his father who was the oldest son. This would also\\n    explain where Lot got the vast herds that forced him and Abraham to\\n    separate shortly after arriving in Canaan.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Life in Ur</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Of all the cities on the face of the earth in which to live in Abraham's\\n    day, Ur would have won top honors. It was the Paris of its time, even more\\n    advanced than any city in Egypt, leading in wealth, education, security,\\n    comfort and pleasure. Standing at the head of the Persian Gulf, it\\n    controlled the mouth of the Euphrates. Thousands of tablets have been\\n    recovered from the site that reflect this period. Numerous royal graves\\n    were found unrobbed and filled with historical artifacts. The temple\\n    complex housed a school. Sir Leonard Woolley excavated the levels of Ur\\n    from 1922-1934 and learned from student work tablets the extensive\\n    knowledge taught its youth, even high school level math. Consequently, the\\n    free population was both intelligent and well educated. The monarchy and\\n    the worship of the moon god were unifying institutions.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Archaeologists report that most of Ur's population consisted of\\n    servants/slaves. If 90% were not completely free and the country's total\\n    population numbered 250,000, then only 25,000 were actual citizens.\\n    Abraham's kin could have numbered in the hundreds and wielded a significant\\n    influence within the free population. About Abraham's time Ur had a\\n    powerful and successful army. At one point it was the dominant force in\\n    Mesopotamia, establishing hegemony all the way up the Euphrates to the\\n    Mediterranean. Free citizens made up the higher echelons. If Abraham had\\n    followed a military career, he would have studied military science and\\n    worked up to a significant command position. Whether or not the military\\n    was his career, his military savvy shines in the following event.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>The Campaign of Four Mesopotamian Armies</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    In an astonishing military victory Abraham defeated a coalition of four\\n    Mesopotamian armies some nine years after he arrived in Canaan. After\\n    serving the King of Elam 12 years the population center where Lot moved\\n    rebelled. Scripture is clear about the military force that retaliated\\n    (Genesis 14:1-16)-its size, objective and success. The king, Chedorlaomer,\\n    brought his army from an area to the east of Lower Mesopotamia, today's\\n    southwestern Iran. These people were later called Persians. After Abraham\\n    followed God to Haran, Chedorlaomer's country defeated Ur and destroyed the\\n    city. In short order Elam extended its governance all the way to the\\n    Sodom-Gomorrah region. Now its present ruler came with three\\n    allies-Amraphel king of Shinar (Babylon), Arioch king of Ellasar (Larsa,\\n    longtime rival of Ur) and Tidal, king of Nations (apparently from Upper\\n    Mesopotamia).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    These four kings controlled an enormous area, from Upper Mesopotamia to\\n    well beyond Lower Mesopotamia, 500 to 1500 miles distant from Sodom. One\\n    commentator suggested this force could have numbered 100,000 soldiers.\\n    Their columns stretched for miles. As they left the Euphrates and marched\\n    southwest towards Sodom, raiders from the badlands to the east plundered\\n    their columns and supply lines. Distracted from their original mission they\\n    began fighting people group after people group to the east of their route\\n    (Genesis 14:5-6). These actions eventually placed them to the south and\\n    east of their goal.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Turning west they encountered and defeated the desert people that occupied\\n    the lands south of Sodom. Finally they reached their objective, attacking\\n    the Sodomites but in a surprise maneuver only hinted at in Scripture. The\\n    defenders expected the enemy to approach from the south but seem to have\\n    been pinned against the bitumen pits. This would point to an unexplained\\n    backdoor route descending the hills to the west and only lightly guarded by\\n    the defenders. In this battle the consortium utterly crushed the five kings\\n    that governed the heavily populated Sodom-Gomorrah civilization bowl. With\\n    no opposition remaining, the victors began the long march home loaded with\\n    plunder and the population whom they would sell into slavery. Abraham's\\n    \\\"big brother\\\" was headed for a miserable future.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Abraham's Private Army</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    An escapee brought the bad news to Abraham who immediately gathered his\\n    forces to free Lot. The odds at this point appeared to be 100 to 1. This\\n    was certain suicide, unless Abraham was a military genius. Scripture\\n    suggests as much, relating that Abraham \\\"led forth his trained men, born in\\n    his house, 318 of them.\\\" (Genesis 14:14). Abraham had his own private army.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Until now Scripture had said nothing about Abraham training his servants\\n    for combat. From what happens in the battle one must conclude that they had\\n    military skills equal to the invaders who were professional soldiers,\\n    battle hardened after an unexpectedly difficult possibly year-and-a-half\\n    long campaign. With Abraham about 84 years old the youngest of his fighters\\n    would have been born when Abraham was 64 years old or 11 years before he\\n    left Haran for Canaan. The fact that they were born in his house indicates\\n    he began their training at an early age and that this practice had been\\n    going on for many years.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    What did these trained fighters look like? As a general over his army\\n    Abraham trained them to handle lethal weapons and kill. His forces knew how\\n    to work together to overcome far superior forces. They were cunning, strong\\n    and had tremendous endurance. Where could Abraham possibly have gained this\\n    military knowledge? You guessed it-in Ur. During his early years in Ur its\\n    army was having great success. Now he had an army like Ur's in his very own\\n    household. His men could face the best from Mesopotamia. Would it be too\\n    much to say Abraham's 318 were among the best soldiers alive in their day?\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Abraham's Amorite Confederates</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Even more remarkable, Abraham had Amorite confederates who joined this\\n    suicidal venture. Why? They had to have confidence in Abraham's knowledge\\n    of warfare. This explains another mystery. Why would the Amorites share\\n    their land with Abraham in the first place? Shortly after arriving in\\n    Canaan the range land proved insufficient for Abraham's and Lot's cattle so\\n    they separated. Lot set his tent towards Sodom while Abraham moved to\\n    Hebron. What Scripture doesn't explain is that Hebron was the highest\\n    ground in Israel, even higher than Jerusalem which is a half mile above sea\\n    level. It was one of the most out of the way and defensible locations\\n    Abraham could choose. Furthermore, it had limited access. It was at a dead\\n    end. Abraham literally took the high ground. But it was occupied by\\n    Amorites. So while this act displays great military savvy, how would the\\n    Amorites ever be persuaded to share their land with him?\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    First, Abraham proved to be a diplomat and a business man. Somehow he\\n    showed them that his presence would be to their advantage. Second, he must\\n    have shared his military experiences from Ur. The Amorites had never heard\\n    such things. They were impressed. His fighters and the Amorite fighters\\n    would have contests. Abraham's were superior. Abraham began telling them\\n    how he trained his fighters. They formed a mutual defense alliance. Over a\\n    five or six year period the Amorites greatly increased their military\\n    skills and came to have unflagging confidence in Abraham.\\n</p>\\n<p align=\\\"center\\\">\\n    <strong>A Military Victory for the Books</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Now Lot and his family were prisoners. Abraham loved his nephew and saw his\\n    interest in the true God (\\\"righteous Lot\\\" II Peter 2:7). But what chance\\n    did Abraham have against the ocean of invaders? Again, his knowledge of\\n    warfare. He would know that once the invader's campaign was successful, the\\n    kings and most of their soldiers would head for home at top speed. At a\\n    much slower pace a small but adequate force would return with the vast\\n    plunder and the many slaves. Possibly only 5,000 to 10,000 soldiers\\n    remained, but still the odds were five or ten to one.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    But Abraham had one more ace up his sleeve. He knew that discipline would\\n    be almost non-existent now that the army had vanquished all opposition. The\\n    coalition had been fighting for over a year. This was a time to celebrate\\n    and those celebrations typically came in the form of nightly drunken orgies\\n    at the expense of the female prisoners. Apparently even nighttime\\n    reconnaissance patrols were neglected. From his days in Ur Abraham\\n    understood the various plans for night watches, passwords, trumpet signals,\\n    command structure, and camp layout. He also knew the typical contingency\\n    plans for night attacks. In other words, he knew the military science of\\n    Southern Mesopotamia. Further, he and senior members of his household knew\\n    the various languages of Mesopotamia and could use those languages to get\\n    inside the enemy's defenses. Further yet, he had grazed his flocks for\\n    years through the entire area and knew every trail like the back of his\\n    hand. Undoubtedly he sent scouts ahead to gather intelligence. Here in\\n    abbreviated fashion is the scriptural account:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>\\n        And he divided his forces against them by night, he and his servants,\\n        and defeated them and pursued them to Hobah, north of Damascus. Genesis\\n        14:15.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Abraham's plan was to strike in a night attack from multiple directions.\\n    This plan employed a major strategy of military science-surprise. But it\\n    also violated two principles-attacking at night and dividing one's force\\n    against a superior force. It was very, very risky. There would be either\\n    great reward or great loss. Abraham was the overall commander with three\\n    Amorite bands taking orders from him. Possibly his force numbered 600-700.\\n    Abraham and senior officers had to have gone over the plan in great detail.\\n    They caught up with the invaders where the city of Dan would later be\\n    established on the northern boundary of Israel about 110 air miles north of\\n    Hebron. The forced march could hardly have been accomplished in four\\n    exhausting days. Along the way they encountered injured and dead prisoners\\n    and a trail of their discarded possessions. By the time they reached Dan,\\n    though exhausted, they were highly motivated.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Abraham's night attack was a complete success. He could have found wounded\\n    or dead soldiers along the way and taken their uniforms to dress some of\\n    his troops to infiltrate their lines. Perhaps he impersonated a commander\\n    of the invaders and gave guards contradictory orders, using his mastery of\\n    the languages of Lower Mesopotamia and his intimate knowledge of their\\n    military operations. Whatever strategy he used, he utterly surprised and\\n    routed the invaders. He drove the fleeing confederation fifty miles, to a\\n    place called Hobah somewhere north of Damascus. He knew that if the army\\n    regrouped and counterattacked it would all be over for him and his allies.\\n    No enemy soldier could be spared; it was either complete victory or\\n    eventual disaster. Even one escapee could provide the information needed\\n    for a retaliatory strike the next year.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Abraham's Best Defense</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The next spring when armies go to war found Abraham knotted up in fear.\\n    This would be the time when the Mesopotamians would return to wreak\\n    vengeance on him and his neighbors. Where does this idea come from? The\\n    very next chapter records how God appears to him in a vision and said,\\n    \\\"Fear not, Abram. I am your shield; your reward shall be very great.\\\"\\n    (Genesis 15:1). Abraham had dared to strike the flower of Mesopotamia. Now\\n    he feared the worst. But he did not have to fear because the God of\\n    creation would be his shield. Further, apparently he was having second\\n    thoughts about having lifted up his hand \\\"to the LORD God Most High,\\n    Possessor [Creator] of heaven and earth, &#8230;not to take a thread or a\\n    sandal strap or anything that [belonged to Sodom] lest [the king of Sodom]\\n    should say, 'I have made Abram rich'\\\" Genesis 14:22-23. Had that been the\\n    right thing to do? Yes, because for that stand God promised that his reward\\n    would be <strong>very</strong> great.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>75 Years of Preparation in Ur and Haran </strong>\\n    (see also Appendix 3.4)<strong></strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Abraham's military skills point to many adult years in Ur, not the sleepy\\n    village of Urfa 25 miles northwest of Haran while his altars point to years\\n    of growing closer to the LORD in Haran. During the Haran years Terah's\\n    influence waned while Abraham's influence grew. The vast numbers of\\n    Abraham's cattle when he separated from Lot and the 318 shepherd/warriors\\n    born in his house indicate that Abraham did not separate from his father's\\n    household but rather influenced his father's household to worship the God\\n    who led him to Canaan.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Genesis 14 provides a remarkable fit of Scripture and secular history with\\n    regard to Abraham's early years. It records that the Sodom-Gomorrah\\n    confederation had paid tribute to the king of Elam for 12 years. When they\\n    did not pay in the 13<sup>th</sup>, the war machine from Mesopotamia came\\n    to teach them a lesson in the 14<sup>th</sup> year led by Elam. The\\n    campaign lasted two years. Secular history records that Ur reached its\\n    zenith during the 97 golden-year rule of the five kings of the Third\\n    Dynasty. It is an historical fact that its end came suddenly at the hands\\n    of Elam. It broke Ur's control of the lower Euphrates in a military\\n    invasion that overwhelmed the capital itself, burned its palace and\\n    enslaved its population. In a strange and as yet not understood alliance\\n    with other Mesopotamian powers only specifically reported in Scripture to\\n    date, Elam extended its control all the way to Sodom and Gomorrah. Had\\n    Abraham not left Ur in obedience to God, he would have lost his freedom and\\n    wealth if not his life.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The timeline looks like this: Scripture clearly indicates the passing of 14\\n    years, from the first year in which the pentapolis paid tribute to Elam\\nuntil Elam and its allies arrived to punish them for not paying in the 13    <sup>th</sup>. The time needed to forge alliances and establish control\\n    from Ur up the Euphrates and then down the Jordan Valley to the five cities\\n    is unknown. This could have been accomplished in as little as a year or\\n    two. Thus, an estimated minimum of 16 years passed from the fall of Ur to\\n    the punishment dealt the five cities.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Sometime before the fall of Ur, God called Abraham. Upon responding to the\\n    call he lived an unknown number of years in Haran. Then God led him from\\n    Haran to Canaan and when Elam arrived to punish the rebels Abraham had been\\n    in Canaan approximately nine years. This is known because of the next\\n    sequence of events in Abraham's life: God's appearance in a vision and the\\n    blood covenant the next spring, the birth of Ishmael a year later and the\\n    birth of Isaac when Abraham was 100 and Ishmael was 14. Since Abraham was\\n    75 when he arrived in Canaan, he would be 84 when the invaders defeated\\n    Sodom and enslaved Lot.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Secular history gives various ranges of dates for the glorious years of the\\n    Third Dynasty of Ur. The ancient cuneiform documents are consistent in\\n    their records of the names of the five kings of the Third Dynasty, the\\n    number of years each reigned and the major achievements of each. It was the\\n    second of five that actually raised Ur to dominance. However, secular\\n    history has been unable to anchor their 97-year total reign to a fixed\\n    time. Instead it offers various ranges of dates, from early to late, to\\n    moderate, etc. They differ by as much as at total of 155 years. The\\n    earliest range ends at 2150 BC and the latest ends at 1995 BC. Abraham was\\n    75 at 2091 so he fits well into the secular range of dates.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Two entire chapters of the Bible come out of Elam's rise (Genesis 14 and\\n    15). Is that enough to set us thinking that maybe Abraham was an important\\n    figure in Ur? Could it be that at the time of God's call, Abraham was well\\n    into the politics or military of Ur and did not like the way negotiations\\n    were going between his country and Elam? Could it be that due to the\\n    growing problems facing Ur's leaders, he was not so certain about Ur's\\n    future after all? Could it be that when God called, for the first time in\\n    his life he might actually consider leaving Ur? We can only wonder but we\\n    do know that God's timing is perfect.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Here is another thought to chew on: Elam's having conquered the Jordan\\n    Valley just years before Abraham arrived in Canaan would explain why he\\n    could move about so freely. The long established powers of the land had\\n    been shaken to their roots and were busy recovering and rebuilding after\\n    Elam swept through so they paid little attention to this man and his many\\n    flocks and shepherds.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Finally, in an entire different vein, Elam only dominated Southern\\n    Mesopotamia for a short time. Then in some as yet unexplained way the\\n    alliance or one of its members turned on Elam and its power was broken in\\n    that region until the rise of the Persian Empire 1500 years later. A\\n    215-year sojourn in Egypt would place the birth of Abraham long after\\n    Elam's dominance in Mesopotamia and Sodom. If that were the case, Genesis\\n    14 would be fiction. Further, rivals of Ur governed that city-state once\\n    Elam's control had been broken. So whether it was Elam or Ur's rivals, such\\n    a time would not have been conducive to Terah and his relatives thriving in\\n    Ur. If his kinsmen survived at all, it would have been because they fled\\n    the country. If they returned, they would have been involved in picking up\\n    the pieces and living under the control of various other powers and that is\\n    not how secular sources pictures the Ur of Abraham's day.\\n</p>\\n<p align=\\\"center\\\">\\n    <strong>Scriptural Support that Abraham's Call Came in Ur</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    We are convinced that God's call came to Abraham in Ur, not Haran, and that\\n    he spent a number of years in Haran before God led him the rest of the way\\n    to Canaan. But hyper literalists who bend all Scripture to the numbers in\\n    Shem's genealogy reject this position. To support their 215-year Egyptian\\n    sojourn view, they interpret the Apostle Paul's words in Galatians 3 to\\n    mean that God called Abraham in Haran, not Ur and that he immediately\\n    followed God to Canaan. Then 430-years later God gave Israel the Law on\\n    Mount Sinai immediately following the Exodus. They interpret the details of\\n    Abraham's life to fit this view. Book after book repeats this idea. The\\n    Apostle is their only hope even though they misinterpret his argument. When\\n    they deal with the four witnesses of chapter 2, they always start with\\n    Paul.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Nevertheless, what saith the LORD? In the first half of this chapter we\\n    showed that such a view is ruled out by the events in Abraham's life. The\\n    rest of the chapter will look at specific statements of Scripture. The\\n    information will be organized around eight Old Testament passages, one New\\n    Testament passage and an argument from silence. These ten arguments show\\n    beyond question the error of a Haran call and the 215-year sojourn behind\\n    it.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Stephen Says \\\"Ur\\\"</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    In the days following the resurrection of Christ, Stephen was full of grace\\n    and power, doing great wonders and signs among the people. Those who\\ndisputed with him could not withstand the wisdom and the    <strong><u>Spirit</u></strong> with which he spoke so they found people who\\n    falsely charged that Stephen spoke blasphemous words against Moses and God\\n    (Acts 6:8-11). This caused a disturbance that landed Stephen before the\\n    council where additional false charges were made. Stephen defended himself\\n    by reciting major events in the history of Israel, especially showing how\\n    the nation had established a pattern of rejecting God's messengers, last of\\n    all, the Messiah. Speaking by the Holy Spirit, he began with Jewish history\\n    that none could deny:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>\\n    <strong>\\n        Brothers and fathers, hear me. The God of glory appeared to our father\\nAbraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran,        <sup>3</sup>and said to him, \\\"Go out from your land and from your\\n        kindred and go into the land which I will show you.\\\" <sup>4</sup>Then\\n        he went out from the land of the Chaldeans and lived in Haran. And\\n        after his father died, God removed him from there into this land. Acts\\n        7:2-4.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Stephen said exactly what this book maintains are the facts and which those\\n    who add only numbers deny. His words are clear. They can't be interpreted\\n    to mean something else. So, in this case the numerologists don't deny or\\n    put a spin on what he said. Rather they say he made a slip of the tongue;\\n    what he said was erroneous. They say that inerrancy only guarantees that\\n    Stephen said these words, not that he had his facts straight. They say\\n    maybe he was under pressure and was rattled or maybe he was a young\\n    believer and didn't have a good grasp of the Old Testament. Somehow,\\n    Stephen misstated. Their numbers supplant words.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    It is true that inerrancy assures us of what someone said, even when they\\n    speak error. For instance, God had told Adam he would die if he ate fruit\\n    from a certain tree. Then the serpent said to Eve that she would not die if\\n    she ate from that tree (Genesis 3:4). Scripture accurately reported that\\n    the serpent said this even though what he said was untrue.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    This interpretative tool is useful, but used wrongly is dangerous. It can\\n    be used against any of the people in Scripture that said something the\\n    critic disagrees with. There must be strong evidence that the speaker spoke\\n    in error. Where is this evidence? Their only evidence is that it conflicts\\n    with their interpretation of what Paul said in Galatians three. So they say\\n    Paul was right; Stephen was wrong. We suggest both Stephen and Paul were\\n    right. When Paul's words are correctly understood, his words will agree\\n    completely with the words of Stephen. Invoking this extra ordinary use of\\n    the principle of inerrancy is incredulous, strained. After all, Stephen was\\n    full of the Holy Spirit:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>\\n    <strong>\\n        Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit. <sup>8</sup>\\n        Stephen, full of grace and power, was doing great wonders and signs\\n        among the people. <sup>10</sup>They could not withstand the wisdom and\\n        the Spirit with which he was speaking. Acts 6:5, 8, 10.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Recognizing that Stephen did speak accurately, others find a different\\n    interpretation of Acts 7:4 in order to maintain Abraham was the firstborn\\n    of Terah's sons. They observe that three personalities are found in verses\\n    2-4: God, Terah and Abraham. While verse four speaks of \\\"his father,\\\" it\\n    uses the personal pronoun four times. They say \\\"he removed him\\\" refers to\\n    Abraham removing his father Terah, not God removing Abraham. So rather than\\n    God leading Abraham on to Canaan after Terah died, this view says that\\n    sixty years after Abraham arrived in Canaan, his father died. Abraham then\\n    returned to Haran and brought his father's body to Canaan for burial. They\\n    emphasize that this is consistent with the Hebrew mindset of the importance\\n    of where one was buried and are adamant about this interpretation.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Such an explanation is strained and unnecessary. Why would Stephen begin\\n    his address with where Abraham's father was buried rather than that God\\n    Himself led the founder of the Jewish race to Canaan? This bad explanation\\n    demonstrates just how far the numbers over words folks will go to uphold\\n    their chronology from Shem to Abraham. They seem to suffer from\\n    over-literalism. This chapter previously showed another example of\\n    over-literalism. When Scripture says that at the age of 70 Terah fathered\\n    three sons, Abraham, Nahor and Haran, it was not naming his sons in the\\n    order of their birth, nor were they triplets, but they were named in the\\n    order of their importance and that Abraham was the youngest.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Now for the eight Old Testament passages that indicate the call came in Ur.\\n    Many times a single statement in the Bible is used to establish a biblical\\n    truth. Two or three witnesses established a truth in a Jewish court of law.\\n    Including the silence of Scripture we find ten to establish that Ur was the\\n    country God called Abraham to leave.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Eight Old Testament Scriptures Argue for \\\"Ur\\\"</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    1.<strong> Genesis 15:7.</strong> God Himself said He brought Abraham out\\n    from Ur. If the call had come in Haran, God would have said \\\"I am the LORD\\n    who brought you out of Haran.\\\"<strong></strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>\\n        And he said to him, \\\"I am the LORD who brought you out from Ur of the\\n        Chaldeans to give you this land to possess.\\\" Genesis 15:7.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    2. <strong>Genesis 12:1.</strong> In the call God told Abraham to separate\\n    from his father's household. That would make sense if the call came in Ur\\n    because his father had compromised with the idolatry of that city and God\\n    wanted to get Abraham away from his father's influence. But if the call\\n    came in Haran after his father died, there would be no father with his\\n    idolatry to separate from. Death would have done the job. Further, by the\\n    time his father died, his father's household had turned from the idolatry\\n    of Ur and was worshiping at Abraham's altar in Haran. In the end Abraham\\n    and Lot inherited Terah's household.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    3. <strong>Genesis 11:31. </strong>At God's prompting the journey began in\\n    Ur, not Haran.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>\\n        Terah took Abram [Abraham] his son and Lot the son of Haran, his\\n        grandson, and Sarai [Sarah] his daughter-in-law, his son Abram's wife,\\n        and they went forth together from Ur of the Chaldeans to go into the\\n        land of Canaan, but when they came to Haran, they settled there.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    This verse was written in retrospect. It clearly says they departed from\\n    Ur, not Haran, to go to Canaan. While Terah was the patriarch and therefore\\n    nominally in charge, his son Abraham was determined to obey God and go to a\\n    land God would show him, so in effect, Terah was accompanying his son, not\\n    leading his son.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    4. <strong>Genesis 11:28</strong> says that \\\"Haran [Terah's oldest son]\\n    died in the presence of his father Terah in the land of his kindred, in Ur\\n    of the Chaldeans.\\\" Terah's kindred which we would call relatives lived in\\n    Ur, not Haran. Since one of the conditions of God's call to Abraham was to\\n    leave his kindred, the call must have come where Abraham's kindred\\n    lived-Ur.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    5. <strong>Genesis 11:27-25:11.</strong> Argument from the organization of\\n    Genesis. The 215-year view notes that the death of Terah is recorded in\\n    Genesis 11 while the call is recorded in Genesis 12. They conclude that the\\n    call was issued after Terah's death. When they read \\\"Now the LORD said to\\n    Abram&#8230;,\\\" they understand it to be saying, \\\"<strong>Then</strong> the\\n    LORD said to Abram&#8230;\\\" Genesis 12:1. But, are these events sequential?\\n    Does the fact that the record of the call follows the notice of Terah's\\n    death prove God issued the call after Terah's death? Not at all.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Genesis arranges biographical material in logical groupings. First one life\\n    or episode is stated, then another life or episode is presented. Terah's\\n    life is presented in Genesis 11:27-32. Abraham's life follows in Genesis\\n    12-25:11. This is followed by Ishmael's in Genesis 25:12-18, Isaac's in\\n    Genesis 25:19-26:35, Jacob's in 27-35, Esau's in 36, then Joseph's and so\\n    on. What could be more important in the Abraham section than his call?\\n    Thus, the Abraham chapters begin with his call. The fact that Abraham's\\n    call is recorded following the end of the section on Terah says nothing\\n    about when it was issued.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    6. <strong>Nehemiah 9:7-8. </strong>Other Old Testament books refer to\\n    Abraham's country as Ur, not Haran. Abraham was told to leave his country.\\n    Since his country was Ur, the call came when he was living there.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>\\n    <strong>\\n        You are the LORD, the God who chose Abram and brought him out of Ur of\\n        the Chaldeans and gave him the name Abraham. <sup>8</sup>You found his\\n        heart faithful before you and made with him the covenant to give to his\\n        offspring the land of the Canaanite&#8230;.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Nehemiah ranks high among pious Old Testament Jews in prominent places. He\\n    mourned and wept with fasting and prayers for days when he heard that the\\n    walls of Jerusalem had not been repaired. Then when he was performing his\\n    task of setting wine before the emperor of the Persian Empire, Artaxerxes,\\n    the king noticed his sadness. The story came out and Nehemiah was allowed\\n    to go to Jerusalem to rebuild the walls. He organized those who had\\n    returned to Jerusalem and in the face of much opposition, the walls were\\n    rebuilt in just 52 days. Following this was a time of intense spiritual\\n    renewal. He records the Levites praying the words quoted above. They\\n    acknowledged that God had brought Abraham out of Ur of the Chaldeans. For\\n    fifteen hundred years the descendants of Abraham had understood that God\\n    first called Abraham in Ur and later in Canaan made a covenant with him to\\n    give his descendants that land. God's bringing was from Ur, not from Haran.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    7-8. <strong>Joshua 24:2-3. </strong>Two arguments come from these and\\n    other verses:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>\\n    <strong>\\n        Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, \\\"Long ago your fathers lived\\n        beyond the Euphrates, Terah, the father of Abraham and of Nahor, and\\n        they served other gods. <sup>3</sup>Then I took your father Abraham\\n        from beyond the River and led him through all the land of Canaan, and\\n        made his offspring many&#8230;\\\" Joshua 24:2-3.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Joshua specifically states that the fathers of Israel, Terah, Abraham and\\n    Nahor, practiced idolatry (\\\"served other gods\\\") before God took Abraham\\n    from where they lived \\\"beyond the Euphrates\\\" to Canaan. Their idolatry was\\n    real. They did this in Ur. God broke Abraham's idolatrous ways by\\n    separating him from the powerful idolatrous culture of Ur. In Haran Abraham\\n    established the worship of the true God in Terah's household. This worship\\n    continued during the lifetime of Isaac and was the faith Jacob was raised\\n    in. On the other hand Nahor followed Terah and Abraham to the general area\\n    around Haran but kept his idols. His grandson still held to them when Jacob\\n    came to live with him. Abraham's break with idolatry began when he moved\\n    from Ur, not from Haran. Therefore, the call came in Ur, not Haran.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Joshua's use of the phrase \\\"beyond the Euphrates\\\" also points to the call\\n    coming in Ur, not Haran. Altogether this phrase or similar words occur a\\n    dozen times more in Ezra and Nehemiah. The Euphrates is 1000 miles long. It\\n    begins near the mountains of Armenia, flows somewhat west, curves south and\\n    finally heads southeast to empty into the Persian Gulf. Haran is across the\\n    Euphrates River but the expression is mostly used for more than simply\\n    crossing the river. It is like a sweep of the hand to indicate a great\\n    distance. In most of its occurrences this phrase refers to Lower\\n    Mesopotamia. Thus it also confirms that the call came in Ur.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    9. While Scripture specifically says the call came in Ur as seen in the\\n    many references above, nowhere in the Old or New Testaments does it say or\\n    even hint that the call came in Haran. Arguments from silence in themselves\\n    do not establish a truth of Scripture. But when combined with positive\\n    declarative statements, they do add validity to the concept under\\n    consideration.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    In summary, the conditions of Abraham's call, to leave country, kindred,\\n    family and go to a land God would show him could only apply to the time\\n    when Abraham lived in Ur. Why is that so important? Abraham had to replace\\n    the idolatry that gripped Ur with faith in the one true God. Was he ready\\n    for that? He was ready to leave his kindred and Ur, but leaving his\\n    father's household was a road block. Refusing to stay behind they also\\n    would need to leave their idol worship and that was not easily done. So\\n    Haran became an important first step. It cannot be dismissed which the call\\n    coming in Haran does. Hebrews 11 makes it clear that by faith Abraham\\n    obeyed, going out to an unknown destination but ultimately expecting a city\\n    with better foundations, one whose builder and maker is God. Exactly what\\n    he left is very important: the world with all its idols, wealth and glamor.\\n    That was Ur, not Haran.\\n</p>\\n<p align=\\\"center\\\">\\n    <strong>\\n        Brief Chronology of Abraham --- Focusing on Elam's Defeat of Ur\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Overview: Based on 1876 BC arrival in Egypt (Dates BC):\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    2006 - Birth of Jacob\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    2066 - Birth of Isaac\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    2166 - Birth of Abraham\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Firm (f) and estimated (e) dates for events in Abraham's early years:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    2166f - Birth of Abraham in the country of Ur, Mesopotamia\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    2156f - Birth of Sarah\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    2131e - Abraham marries Sarah when she turns 25; he is 35\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    2111e - 2106e - No children after 20-25 years of marriage; Sarah is\\n    obviously barren\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    2111e - 2106e - God calls Abraham to leave his country;\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Abraham accompanied by his father's household follows God's leading\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Abraham and Sarah with their father's household settle in Haran\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong> 2100e - Approximate year that Elam crushes Ur</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    2097e - Elam puts the Jordan Valley pentapolis under tribute\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    2091f - Terah dies; Abraham is 75; God leads him from Haran to Canaan\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    2082e - Mesopotamian armies defeat Jordan Valley pentapolis; Abraham\\n    rescues Lot\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    2081f - God's promises and prophecy to Abraham in Genesis 15\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    2080f - Birth of Ishmael\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    2066f - Birth of Isaac (when Abraham is 100 and Ishmael is 14)\\n</p>\\n\"},x={html:'<h2 class=\"chapter\">\\n    Chapter Four\\n</h2>\\n<h1>\\n    Jacob’s Life Requires a 430-Year Egyptian Sojourn\\n</h1>\\n<p>\\n    The record of Jacob’s life is a moving account of divine intervention and\\n    growing faith.

In order to see that his life does support 430-years, a careful,\\n    in-depth look at the events in his life after the pattern of chapter three\\n    is necessary.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    When Jacob’s father turned 40, Abraham secured a bride for him (Genesis\\n    25:21). After twenty years of barrenness Isaac prayed for her and God\\n    granted his prayer. Miraculously, she became pregnant with twins. As the\\n    babies developed a strange thing began to happen. She sensed a struggling\\n    in her womb. She inquired of the LORD and He said:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Two nations are in your womb, and two peoples from within you shall be\\n    divided; the one shall be stronger than the other, the older shall serve\\n    the younger. Genesis 25:23.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The struggle in Rebekah’s womb foretold the future of the twins and their\\n    descendants. There would be strife, not harmony. There would be two\\n    separate nations pursuing their own interests, not family working toward a\\n    common goal. The older would dominate for a time but eventually the younger\\n    would prevail. Rebekah did not learn this from a soothsayer or even second\\n    hand from a prophet of God. No less than God Himself gave this information\\n    to her directly in answer to her prayer.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    As to their actual births, of Esau Scripture records “The first came out\\n    red, all his body like a hairy cloak.” Of Jacob, Scripture continues,\\n    “afterward his brother came out with his hand holding Esau’s heel” (Genesis\\n    25:26). The midwives must have been dismayed when the second of the twins\\n    immediately followed with his hand holding the heel of the first. Next,\\n    Scripture gives a snapshot of the direction the boys’ lives took:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>\\n        When the boys grew up, Esau was a skillful hunter, a man of the field,\\n        while Jacob was a quiet man, dwelling in tents. Genesis 25:27.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    In the above verse Scripture immediately advances from their birth to the\\n    two as grown men, reporting that the twins grew up to be very different.\\n    Hunting characterized the one, the quiet of home the other. Of Jacob Unger\\n    writes “Jacob preferred the quiet of a home life to the active dangerous\\n    career of a hunter.”<a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\" title=\"\">[1]</a> So\\n    Scripture is extremely brief about their early years. Just the struggling\\n    in the womb, God’s personal explanation and what characterized their adult\\n    years. How different is the story of their father Isaac and all Scripture\\n    told of his conception, birth, youth and adult years before marrying at the\\n    age of 40.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Scripture does not elaborate on what it meant to be a skillful hunter or a\\n    quiet man living in tents. It only hints at these two pursuits by saying\\n    “Isaac loved Esau because he ate of his game, but Rebekah loved Jacob”\\n    (Genesis 25:28). Esau wasn’t just the average hunter; he was “skillful.” He\\n    greatly enhanced the family table with his game. Because of this he was\\n    number one in his father’s books. Rebekah’s greater concern was the\\n    family’s livelihood. Because Jacob focused on learning and operating the\\n    family ranching business, he became number one in her books. While Esau\\n    loved to feel the adrenaline of the hunt, Jacob accepted the discipline of\\n    repetitive daily chores. That daily routine tied him down to a predictable\\n    schedule. These two men couldn’t have been more different.\\n</p>\\n<h3>\\n    Purchasing the Birthright\\n</h3>\\n<p>\\n    After explaining the direction of each twin’s life, Scripture discloses\\n    just one event in their adult lives before Esau married at the age of 40.\\n    One day Esau returned home from the hunt. Apparently he had pressed and\\n    pressed without success to the point of exhaustion. He asked Jacob for a\\n    bowl of his stew. This indicates that the quiet man was there at his\\n    typical station, doing something useful to sustain the family, this time\\n    cooking. Here is what happened:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong><sup>31</sup></strong>\\n    <strong>\\n        Jacob said, “Sell me your birthright now.” <sup>32</sup>Esau said, “I\\n        am about to die; of what use is a birthright to me?” <sup>33</sup>Jacob\\n        said, “Swear to me now.” So he swore to him and sold his birthright to\\n        Jacob. <sup>34b</sup>Thus Esau despised his birthright. Genesis\\n        25:31-33, 34b.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Birthright? Where did this come from? How could Jacob suggest such a thing?\\n    While Scripture gives commentaries on Esau’s action, it does not explore\\n    the background of this event. It assumes the reader would know all that was\\n    involved, that grandfather Abraham died when the twins were 15 years old\\n    and would have told them again and again about God’s appearances to him and\\n    the promises those appearances conveyed. Isaac also had similar personal\\n    experiences with God and had witnessed God’s visitations to his father\\n    Abraham as well. These stories were also told over and over in family\\n    gatherings. While Rebekah may have kept secret God’s words to her before\\n    the birth of the twins, they must have been aware of at least some of the\\n    details of their births and why they were given such unusual names.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Thus, while Scripture does not elaborate, it only seems reasonable that\\n    over the years Jacob and Esau wondered about those stories. Though God’s\\n    visitations to his father and grandfather seemed remote, so beyond anything\\n    actually happening in their lives, if there was something to them, Jacob\\n    wanted to be their recipient. Eventually Jacob came to place a measure of\\n    faith in them and decided to watch for an opportunity to gain the\\n    birthright. Then suddenly the opportunity came. Esau was famished and\\n    wanted something Jacob had. Jacob made the offer and maybe to his amazement\\n    the possessor of the birthright agreed saying “I am about to die; of what\\n    use is a birthright to me?” (Genesis 25:31).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Just what was the birthright at this time? It is worth hearing from a\\n    leading Hebrew commentator:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>\\n        The birthright consisted afterward in a double portion of the father’s\\n        inheritance (Deuteronomy 21:17); but with the Patriarchs it embraced\\n        the chieftainship, rule over the brethren and the entire family\\n        (Genesis 27:29) and the title to the blessing of promise (Genesis 27:4,\\n        27-29), which included the future possession of Canaan and of covenant\\n        fellowship with Jehovah (Genesis 28:4).\\n    </strong>\\n    <a href=\"#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\" title=\"\">[2]</a>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Possessing this birthright conveying all God promised to Abraham and Isaac;\\n    it was the deed to these promises, but it required faith in the true God.\\n    Scripture pronounces harsh judgment on Esau’s act. This passage says he\\n    despised his birthright. Hebrews calls him unholy because of selling his\\n    birthright for a mere meal (Hebrews 12:16). Malachi 1:3 gives an overall\\n    divine assessment: “I have loved Jacob, but Esau, I have hated” (Malachi\\n    1:3). Henry Morris concurs in these assessments:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>\\n        It is remarkable that so many Christians are quick to defend Esau and\\n        rebuke Jacob [trading a meal for the birthright], when God has done\\n        neither. Esau was a profane fornicator, with no redeeming qualities\\n        whatsoever, caring nothing about the spiritual significance and\\n        responsibilities of the patriarchal birthright, until he thought that\\n        its loss might diminish his inherited wealth.\\n    </strong>\\n    <a href=\"#_ftn3\" name=\"_ftnref3\" title=\"\">[3]</a>\\n    <strong> (Our words in brackets.)</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    After the birthright incident nothing more is said of the boys until the\\n    end of the next chapter of Genesis. There Scripture reports Esau got\\n    married. By way of background, when Isaac turned forty, Abraham found him a\\n    bride—Rebekah, a granddaughter of Abraham’s older brother Nahor. Now Esau\\n    was 40, yet his father gave no indication of finding him and Jacob mates.\\n    Possibly Esau became convinced his father would do nothing so according to\\n    the following verse, before the year was out, the man of action, Esau,\\n    married not one but two Canaanite women:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong><sup>34</sup></strong>\\n    <strong>\\n        When Esau was forty years old, he took Judith the daughter of Beeri the\\n        Hittite, and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite, <sup>35</sup>\\n        and they made life bitter for Isaac and Rebekah. Genesis 26:34-35.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    This action brought Canaanite life with all its evil right into Isaac’s\\n    household. The two Canaanite women made life bitter for both Rebekah and\\n    Isaac. Jacob, seeing their distress, decided to wait for the right woman.\\n    That wait lasted forty more years. This second report of Esau’s actions\\n    conclude how Scripture would have us view Esau at this point in his life,\\n    confirming the characterizations of Genesis 25:34, Hebrews 12:16 and\\n    Malachi 1:3.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The next glimpse of the twins is even more distressing and not without\\n    controversy. When Isaac thought he was dying, he determined to pass on the\\n    blessing of the firstborn to Esau, the twin born first. In view of the\\n    words of God to Rebekah and the direction of Esau’s life, Isaac’s plan is\\n    unexplainable. Without question he was badly confused. But we know what\\n    happened. Rebekah learned of the plan. She dressed Jacob to impersonate\\n    Esau and Isaac unintentionally gave the blessing to Jacob.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Esau was angry and let it be known that he would kill his brother once his\\n    father died. At that point he would add murder to his list of evils. Jacob\\n    didn’t doubt his older brother’s word and feared for his life. But sanity\\n    prevailed. Rebekah discussed the situation with Isaac who blessed Jacob and\\n    sent him away to the household of his mother’s father in Haran. He must\\n    take a wife from his mother’s people. He must not marry a Canaanite woman.\\n    Trusting God he departed on the 500-mile journey with only a staff in his\\n    hand. In this way God preserved the Abrahamic line from the abominations of\\n    the Canaanites.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Only a few nights from home 74-year old Jacob had a dream. In it he saw the\\n    angels of God rushing up and down on a grand staircase as they carried out\\n    God’s work on earth. At the top was God Himself. He spoke to Jacob, saying\\n    He was the God of Abraham and Isaac, that He would give this land to Jacob\\n    and his offspring, that his offspring would be like the dust of the earth,\\n    that in Jacob and his offspring all the families of the earth would be\\n    blessed, that He would keep Jacob and return him to this land (Genesis\\n    28:10-15).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Nothing more is said of the journey but no sooner had Jacob reached his\\n    destination than he was taken with Rachel who was “beautiful in form and\\n    appearance” (Genesis 29:17). Rachel was the daughter of his mother’s\\n    brother. Since her older sister, Leah, was becoming something of an old\\n    maid, Rachel might have been considerably older than a teenager. Jacob\\n    offered to serve seven years for her hand in marriage and Laban agreed to\\n    the offer.\\n</p>\\n<h2>\\n    A Closer Look at Jacob\\n</h2>\\n<p>\\n    Jacob has received much criticism for the actions of his youth. But are\\n    they consistent with God’s revelation? What do we learn from Scripture?\\n    First, Jacob’s character. Dr. Morris was distressed to find most\\n    commentators characterized Jacob as a crooked man, a heel grabber. While it\\n    cannot be denied he was shrewd, even crafty, he had fine qualities that\\n    need to be laid beside his stealth. Per chance they mitigate and even cast\\n    a different light on the broad judgment that he was basically dishonest.\\n    After all, Rahab told a direct lie but no commentator casts her in the\\n    light of being a liar. David committed adultery but no commentator\\n    characterizes him as basically immoral. Other qualities far outshine\\n    Rahab’s lie and David’s adultery. As for Jacob, he was professional,\\n    productive, hard-working, likable and God was with him.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Was he basically dishonest? It was his mother who all but ordered him to\\n    impersonate Esau. She had great influence on him. He had even foregone\\n    marriage out of his respect for his parents’ feelings and judgment. His\\n    father was apparently about to disregard God’s will and his mother proposed\\n    a way to avoid that. As to her plan, it certainly was dishonest, but the\\n    tendency toward dishonesty came mostly from her side of the family. Her\\n    brother was as crooked as they come. He changed Jacob’s wages countless\\n    times to steal what rightly belonged to Jacob. He gave Jacob Leah after\\n    Jacob had served him seven years for Rachel. So let’s dispense with\\n    labeling Jacob “dishonest.” Instead see him as Scripture begins to speak\\n    much of him, beginning with his arrival in the region of Haran.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>\\n        Now as soon as Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother’s\\n        brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother’s brother, Jacob came near\\n        and rolled the stone from the well’s mouth and watered the flock of\\n        Laban his mother’s brother. Genesis 29:10.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Notice Jacob’s skill with animals. Although he was a complete stranger to\\n    this flock, Rachel’s sheep immediately sensed they were in good hands,\\n    allowing him to water them. Jacob also understood the sheep business for he\\n    had previously noted to the other shepherds that it was high noon and the\\n    sheep needed to be grazing, not waiting to be watered. Then, without help,\\n    he removed the cover from the well and watered Rachel’s sheep. He was not\\n    bound by incompetent practices which limited the success of shepherding in\\n    that area. This act displayed initiative, independence, strength,\\n    confidence and competence.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    If Jacob acted with professionalism towards this newly encountered flock,\\n    his next action showed a soul filled with deep emotion and expectation. His\\n    skill with the sheep was only exceeded by his way with the shepherdess.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>\\n    <strong>\\n        Then Jacob kissed Rachel and wept aloud. <sup>12</sup>And Jacob told\\n        Rachel that he was her father’s kinsman, and he was Rebekah’s son, and\\n        she ran and told her father. Genesis 29:11-12.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The kiss: Maybe tender and on the cheek, but arising from deep emotion.\\n    This 74-year-old man bawled aloud. Just as Abraham’s servant had found his\\n    mother immediately upon his arrival 94 years before, Jacob no more arrived\\n    than he stumbled on what he must have hoped would be his life’s partner.\\n    Both events happened somewhere near Haran. She was the right fit—his\\n    mother’s niece, his own cousin whom he had never met and probably did not\\n    know existed, beautiful, enterprising, engaging and receiving. What a\\n    reward after forsaking his home of 74 years and making a perilous, lonely,\\n    500-mile journey. The girl’s father invited Jacob to stay with them.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The next verses tell us Jacob was smart and industrious. Rather than\\n    spending all of his time with Rachel, he immediately set out to impress her\\n    father with his work ethic and he succeeded. A month later Laban\\n    uncharacteristically began the following conversation:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>\\n        Because you are my kinsman, should you therefore serve me for nothing?\\n        Tell me, what shall your wages be? Genesis 29:15.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Wages? Here was Jacob’s opportunity. Jacob wanted Rachel. He had no money\\n    for a dowry but he could work. He made an offer of service for this\\n    daughter of Laban. He would serve Laban seven years for Rachel and then she\\n    would be his. Next we read:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>\\n    <strong>\\n        So Jacob served seven years for Rachel, and they seemed to him but a\\n        few days because of the love he had for her. <sup>21</sup>Then Jacob\\n        said to Laban, “Give me my wife that I may go in to her, for my time is\\n        completed.” Genesis 29:20-21.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    What love it had been that seven years would seem like a few days. Then\\n    Jacob went to Laban and asked for Rachel so he could “go in to her.” The\\n    reason he was asking was that he had completed his seven years of service\\n    for her. “Going in to her” is a euphemism for marital intimacy. In effect\\n    Jacob was saying that he had not violated Rachel’s virginity even though he\\n    had been with Laban seven years.\\n</p>\\n<h2>\\n    Jacob Marries the Wrong Woman\\n</h2>\\n<p>\\n    Next Scripture reports on the wedding celebration:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>\\n    <strong>\\n        So Laban gathered together all the people of the place and made a\\n        feast. <sup>23</sup>But in the evening he took his daughter Leah and\\n        brought her to Jacob, and he went in to her. <sup>25</sup>And in the\\n        morning behold, it was Leah! And Jacob said to Laban, What is this you\\n        have done to me? Did I not serve with you for Rachel? Why then have you\\n        deceived me?” <sup>26</sup>Laban said, “It is not so done in our\\n        country, to give the younger before the firstborn.” Genesis 29:22-23,\\n        25-26.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The passage does not say how Laban switched daughters but it clearly states\\n    he successfully did. In the morning Jacob was outraged and accused Laban of\\n    deception. He said, “What is this you have done to me? Did I not serve with\\n    you for Rachel?” Why then have you deceived me? (Genesis 29:25). Clearly\\n    Jacob had fulfilled his end of the bargain. He had served seven years for\\n    Rachel. Laban affirmed it by explaining a previously unmentioned custom,\\n    that the oldest daughter had to be married first.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>\\n        The Traditional Approach: Marriage before the Years of Service\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Astonishingly, the leading advocate of the 215-year approach, Archbishop\\n    James Ussher as well as others to this day say this wedding celebration\\n    took place before Jacob had served any of the 14 years. In complete\\n    disregard to the words of the Bible Ussher offers the following chronology:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>1759 BC – Jacob flees from Esau to Haran</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>1758 BC – Leah bears Reuben</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>1757 BC – Leah bears Simeon</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>1756 BC – Leah bears Levi</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>1755 BC – Leah bears Judah</strong>\\n    <a href=\"#_ftn4\" name=\"_ftnref4\" title=\"\">[4]</a>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Ussher’s chronology above shows Jacob to have fathered his firstborn the\\n    year following his arrival in Haran. Since Leah was the mother, by\\n    implication both daughters became wives of Jacob at the beginning of his\\n    20-year stay with Laban. Ussher’s dates show he believed Leah’s first four\\n    sons were born just one year apart beginning one year after Jacob’s arrival\\n    in Haran. Why would he and those holding the 215-year view to this day\\n    contradict the clear words of Scripture? The following three reasons are\\n    offered; this chapter shows that each was unsound.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    1. Scripture relates a sequence of births one after another, not several at\\n    the same time.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    2. All the children were born by the time Jacob had been with Laban 14\\n    years because of the six year work contract\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    3. The children had to be several years older than they would be if he\\n    worked seven years before receiving his bride(s) because of later events in\\n    the life of Jacob.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Confirming Marriage to Leah; Serving for Rachel</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Back to our story. Laban had a solution:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>\\n    <strong>\\n        [Laban said] “Complete the week of this one [Leah], and we will give\\n        you the other [Rachel] also in return for serving me another seven\\n        years.” <sup>28</sup>Jacob did so, and completed her [Leah’s] week [of\\n        wedding celebration]. Then Laban gave him his daughter Rachel to be his\\n        wife. Genesis 29:27-28. (Our words in brackets.)\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Laban’s solution was that Jacob could have Rachel as well as Leah for seven\\n    more years of service. He only asked that Jacob fulfill the week of wedding\\n    celebration with Leah and then he would give Jacob Rachel as well. The\\n    solution seemed straight forward. Jacob was to complete the very public\\n    marriage celebration to the older sister. There would be no doubt in\\n    anyone’s mind that he was married to her. After the festivities he would be\\n    given the younger sister as well and then serve Laban seven more years for\\n    the second wife.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    This new offer meant Jacob would continue to celebrate his marriage to Leah\\n    for the remaining six days—no public scene denouncing Laban as a deceiver,\\n    no cold shoulder to Leah; rather, pleasant, cheerful, celebrating. Jacob\\n    had not planned to be a bigamist. Both his father and grandfather were\\n    one-woman type of men. For seven years thoughts about Rachel had helped him\\n    through each exhausting day. Her presence lit up his life. He had no\\n    interest in any other woman.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Jacob was over a barrel. He wanted Rachel with all his heart. He would do\\n    almost anything for her. Further he was a decent man and didn’t want to\\n    denounce Leah. Wittingly or not, he had spent the night with her. Who would\\n    want her now? He was undoubtedly angry and probably confused and he didn’t\\n    have the luxury of time to think it over. Scripture records his decision\\n    and Laban’s response: “Jacob did so and completed her week. Then Laban gave\\n    him his daughter Rachel to be his wife” (Genesis 29:28). So Jacob said\\n    “uncle” and soon had twice as many wives as he ever intended. Nine months\\n    later Leah gave Jacob his first son, sealing her status as his wife.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Laban’s plan was a complete success. His older daughter who had attracted\\n    no successful suitor was very publicly wedded to Jacob. Laban’s honor was\\n    intact. He would have no old maid daughter languishing in his house. Most\\n    likely at least his household knew what he had done but woe to the person\\n    who questioned his actions. Thus was the power of the family patriarch in\\n    his day.\\n</p>\\n<h3>\\n    Problem of the Sequence of Children’s Births\\n</h3>\\n<p>\\n    The genealogists say the Scripture tells the sequence of the children’s\\n    births. This sequence requires approximately fourteen years. The only way\\n    to find that much time is for Laban to have given his two daughters to\\n    Jacob at the beginning of Jacob’s 20 year stay. We suggest that on\\n    occasion, Scripture groups similar events and thoughts before going back\\n    over the same time frame to report other events and thoughts. The following\\n    are examples of Scriptural grouping:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Esau’s genealogy is inserted between the death of Isaac and Joseph’s story.\\n    Genesis 35 ends with the death of Isaac. Genesis 36 chronicles 500 years of\\n    Jacob’s twin brother’s line. Genesis 37:1 actually backtracks to events\\n    before Isaac’s death. Thus 500 years of Edomite history are inserted in the\\n    middle of the Jacob/Joseph narrative.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Genesis 2:5 returns to day six of creation week after Genesis 1:1-2:3\\n    reports the full seven days. The sons of Japheth are listed in Genesis\\n    10:2-5, then the descendants of Ham (10:6-20) and finally the descendants\\n    of Shem (10:21-31). No one would dispute that division of history, but\\n    Genesis 10 would be very confusing if it reported each birth as it\\n    happened. Genesis 11:27-32 reports the record of Terah before taking up\\n    God’s dealing with Abraham which reaches back to his call in Ur (Genesis\\n    12-24) 10 or 15 years before. Genesis 35:28-29 reports the death of Isaac\\n    even though it happened 13 (or was it 12 years? I must research.) years\\n    after the selling of Joseph in Genesis 37.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Similarly, we believe that because several mothers were expecting at the\\n    same time and therefore births overlapped, the writer chose to group the\\n    births of Jacob’s children: Leah’s first four, then Bilhah’s two, then\\n    Zilpah’s two, then Leah’s final three and lastly Rachel’s son. Because of\\n    overlapping pregnancies, twelve children were born in just 10 years.\\n</p>\\n<h3>\\n    Twelve Births in Ten Years\\n</h3>\\n<p>\\n    Over the next ten years Jacob fathered eleven sons plus a daughter. But the\\n    other side can only see seven years available for these 12 children if\\n    Jacob served seven years before he received two wives and then six years\\n    for the cattle. Thus they manipulate Scripture to make more time. We will\\n    see that ten years were available and that ten years was sufficient. But\\n    first, we must acknowledge that this was the work of God. The odds of\\n    having eleven sons in a row are enormous. God was behind all this and the\\n    goal was our salvation, Jesus Christ, Jacob’s ultimate seed and the defeat\\n    of Satan. Scripture does not tell us all the details of the scenario God\\n    used. Because some insist it was impossible, we suggest one scenario that\\n    is entirely consistent with Scripture. While the following is speculative,\\n    it honors Scripture.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    When the week of celebrating Jacob’s marriage to Leah was over, Laban\\n    quietly gave Jacob his younger daughter as well. Jacob immediately\\n    transferred to Rachel’s bedroom and spent nearly all of his time there for\\n    the next 13 years. At first possibly this was a family secret but in time\\n    it simply became accepted as the way things were. This transfer of bedrooms\\n    is apparent from the names Leah chose for her six boys and the mandrake\\n    event. She called her firstborn Reuben “Because,” she said, “the LORD has\\n    looked upon my affliction; for now my husband will love me.” (Genesis\\n    29:32). How was she afflicted? How was she unloved? Her husband paid her no\\n    attention. He spent his nights in Rachel’s tent. Score: Leah-1; Rachel-0.\\n    Elapsed time: 9 months since the marriage.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Jacob knew about conception. Animal breeding was his life. To say he was a\\n    successful animal breeder would be an understatement. He became wealthy\\n    through his breeding skills. In the next few years Jacob discovered that\\n    Leah was a virtual baby machine, and sons at that! Leah would deliver a son\\n    and six months later she would conceive again—spacing boys about 15 months\\n    apart. Rachel had not conceived in nine months while Leah conceived that\\n    very first week. So about 6 months after Leah’s first delivery, Jacob began\\n    visiting her bedroom until she became pregnant again. But then he went back\\n    to Rachel. Scripture tells us as much. Leah named her second son Simeon\\n    “Because the LORD has heard that I am hated.” (Genesis 29:33). Hated? Yes.\\n    Her husband spent his nights with Rachel, not with Leah. Score: Leah-2;\\n    Rachel-0. Elapsed time: 24 months since the marriage (9+6+9=24).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    About 6 months after Leah’s second delivery, Jacob returned and soon she\\n    was expecting a third time. A total of 30 months had elapsed (9+6+9+6=30).\\n    This may have been when a new development unfolded. Rachel engaged Jacob in\\n    a heated argument. She demanded he make her pregnant. He said he was not\\n    God. Well, if he couldn’t make her pregnant, he must give her a child by\\n    her handmaid, Bilhah. Jacob must have thought, “Is a third wife the price\\n    of peace?” With that, Bilhah conceived and behold, another boy. This son\\n    was born shortly after Leah’s third. Score: Leah-3; Rachel-1. Elapsed time\\n    since Jacob’s marriage: 42 months (30+9+3=42).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Six months after her third delivery, Leah became pregnant a fourth time.\\n    About three months later, Bilhah became pregnant with her second. So\\n    fifty-four months after her marriage, Leah mothered a fourth son\\n    (9+15+15+15=54) while Bilhah delivered her second son three months later.\\n    For the first time Leah did not complain about her husband’s absence.\\n    Instead she said, “This time I will praise the Lord.” (Genesis 29:35).\\n    Score: Leah-4; Rachel-2; Elapsed time since Jacob’s marriage: 57 months\\n    (54+3=57). Jacob now has six sons in just four and three-quarter years.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    When Leah didn’t get pregnant as she usually did about six months after the\\n    birth of her fourth son, she became uneasy. Maybe Bilhah became pregnant\\n    for a third time which would later prove to be a girl, but Leah would not\\n    know it at the time. Leah must have fretted, “Rachel is catching up! I must\\n    do something. Rachel enlisted her handmaid. I’ll do the same with my\\n    handmaid Zilpah.” As to Laban’s thoughts on the matter, he was already\\n    bragging to his men friends: “You hear? Six grandsons in less than five\\n    years. Isn’t that a record?”\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    At the same time Jacob may have been thinking, “God, you said, ‘Your\\n    offspring shall be like the dust of the earth, and you shall spread abroad\\n    to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south, and in you\\n    and your offspring shall all the families of the earth be blessed.’\\n    (Genesis 28:14). God, I had no idea, but if this is how, so be it.” So when\\n    Leah offered her handmaid, Jacob went for broke. Nine months later Zilpah\\n    delivered a son. Score: Leah-5; Rachel-2 (plus possibly a girl from\\n    Bilhah). Elapsed time: 72 months or six years (57+6+9=72).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Six months after the birth of Zilpah’s first son, Jacob came again and\\n    Zilpah became pregnant with a second son. When she delivered him nine\\n    months later, Leah named him Asher which connotes happiness. This indicates\\n    Leah was not displeased that her husband had fathered two sons through her\\n    handmaid. Score: Leah-6; Rachel-2. Elapsed time: 87 months or 7 years and\\n    three months (72+15=87).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Genesis 30:14 reports that little Reuben came in from the field with\\n    mandrakes (love apples—thought to help in conceiving). Rachel asked Leah\\n    for some. Apparently Jacob had given up on Rachel conceiving even though he\\n    still shared her bed. As for Leah, Jacob hadn’t come to her tent for nearly\\n    a year and a half (the last time was six months after the birth of her\\n    fourth son when she did not conceive). Leah struck the following bargain:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>\\n    <strong>\\n        But she [Leah] said to her, “Is it a small matter that you have taken\\n        away my husband? Would you take away my son’s mandrakes also?” Rachel\\n        said, “Then he may lie with you tonight in exchange for your son’s\\n        mandrakes.” <sup>16</sup>When Jacob came from the field in the evening,\\n        Leah went out to meet him and said, “You must come in to me, for I have\\nhired you with my son’s mandrakes.” So he lay with her that night.        <sup>17</sup>And God listened to Leah, and she conceived and bore Jacob\\n        a fifth son. Genesis 30:15-17.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Here we read that Leah had to hire her husband for a single night some\\n    seven years and four sons after they were married! Clearly, Jacob did not\\n    divide his time between Leah and Rachel. Leah who hoped for the attention\\n    of her husband came to derive happiness from her sons and from the Lord who\\n    answered her prayer for a fifth son. Maybe Jacob was still blind to her\\n    worth, but who cared when the hugs of little boys never ceased, and\\n    grandfather Laban swelled with pride.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Note that Scripture does not indicate that Leah’s fifth pregnancy followed\\n    Zilpah’s second pregnancy. Rather, Scripture groups Zilpah’s two\\n    pregnancies together just as it grouped Bilhah’s two pregnancies together.\\n    We suggest that Leah rested for two years after the birth of Judah and then\\n    became pregnant for the fifth time when Jacob visited her tent for a single\\n    night six and a half years after their marriage. Fifteen months later Jacob\\n    visited again and Leah became pregnant with her sixth son. Fifteen months\\n    later Jacob visited again and Leah became pregnant with her first daughter.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    To summarize, Rachel’s handmaid carried sons during Leah’s 3<sup>rd</sup>\\n    and 4<sup>th</sup> pregnancies while Leah’s handmaid carried pregnancies\\n    towards the end of Leah’s 24 month resting period and again during her\\n    fifth pregnancy. Rachel delivered Joseph shortly before Leah’s first\\n    daughter was born, maybe three months before. By this scenario, the total\\n    time involved from Jacob’s week-long marriage celebration to Leah to the\\nbirth of Dinah was 117 months (9+3*15+24+9+2*15=117)    <a href=\"#_ftn5\" name=\"_ftnref5\" title=\"\">[5]</a>. 117 months is nine years\\n    and nine months. Final score: eight sons and one daughter for Leah’s team;\\n    three sons and an unreported number of daughters for Rachel’s team.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Rachel also learned to look to God rather than Jacob during this time:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>\\n    <strong>\\nThen God remembered Rachel and God listened to her and opened her womb.        <sup>23</sup>She conceived and bore a son and said, “God has taken away\\n        my reproach.” <sup>24</sup>And she called his name Joseph, saying, “May\\n        the LORD add to me another son!” Genesis 30:22-24.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The paragraph before the birth of Joseph concludes with “Afterward she\\n    (Leah) bore a daughter and called her name Dinah.” (Genesis 30:21). The\\n    writer grouped Leah’s last three births together, but indicated that\\n    Joseph’s birth came before Dinah’s birth. In this way all of the children\\n    were born within the birthing years of Leah. This is not the only scenario\\n    that could be devised, but whichever one it was, Scripture says it was\\n    successful. Who is man to change what God said happened?\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The scenario we use places Joseph’s birth at 114 months (9.5 years) after\\n    Jacob received his two wives. When Joseph was born is the key to the age of\\n    Jacob and his children. He was 130 when he appeared before Pharaoh (Genesis\\n    47:9) and Joseph was 39. [Joseph was elevated at the age of 30 (Genesis\\n    41:46) officiated over seven years of plenty and two years of famine when\\n    he stood with his father before pharaoh (30+7+2=39)]. Therefore, Joseph was\\n    born when Jacob was 91 (130-39=91). We suggest that about three and a half\\n    years later Jacob returned to Canaan and was 94.5 years old. Thus he\\n    arrived in Haran at the age of 74 and was married at the age of 81\\n    (74+7=81). Since Scripture doesn’t work with fractions of a year, we need\\n    to work with the whole number of departing Haran at the age of 94.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    In summary, this is our view: Jacob served Laban seven years, then married\\n    Leah and Rachel and fathered twelve children in the next ten years. Sadly,\\n    the numbers-over-words approach is that more years were needed and\\n    concluded Laban gave his two daughters to Jacob shortly after he first\\narrived. Thus by silence in the case of Ussher in    <em>The Annals of the World</em>, and through explaining Scripture away in\\n    the case of his modern counterparts, inerrancy is violated. Where is faith\\n    in all this? Inerrancy requires us to accept what God has clearly said, not\\n    follow our own reasoning. Unfortunately, the inerrancy view continues to be\\n    rejected to this day.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    However, first an observation is in order. Early Bible history emphasizes\\n    sons. The genealogies from Adam to Noah and from Seth to Abraham are\\n    records of sons begetting sons. Some fathers had multiple wives. No lines\\n    are recorded in terms of daughters begetting daughters; wives having\\n    multiple husbands is likewise unrecorded. When Jacob fled Laban, Genesis\\n    31:17 reports, “So Jacob arose and set his sons and his wives on camels.”\\n    Yet when Jacob moved his people to Egypt, Genesis 46:5-7 says, “Then Jacob\\n    set out from Beersheba... and came into Egypt, Jacob and all his offspring\\n    with him, his sons and his sons’ sons, his daughters, and his sons’\\n    daughters….”\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    “Daughters” is plural, yet only Dinah is said to have been born to him in\\n    all his years. Because of the emphasis on “sons,” it is possible that the\\n    handmaids of Leah and Rachel bore unnamed daughters to Jacob either before\\n    or after he left Haran. Since the Scripture is silent about when one or\\n    more other daughters were born to Jacob, we need to be aware that possibly\\n    during the birth of the eleven sons in Haran, one or more other daughters\\n    were also born to him. We make this point because sometimes interpreters\\n    state dogmatically what Scripture does not actually say. In honoring the\\n    principle of inerrancy, we must diligently stand where Scripture stands and\\n    be tentative where Scripture is silent. This principle will become\\n    particularly important as we look at individual genealogies in the next two\\n    chapters.\\n</p>\\n<h3>\\n    Problem of the Timing of Jacob’s Contract\\n</h3>\\n<p>\\n    Secondly, the 215-year people say Jacob’s wages supports their view, with\\n    the following line of thinking. Jacob requested being sent away as soon as\\n    his eleventh son, Joseph, was born. Laban urged Jacob to stay with him and\\n    offered to let him name his wages. Since Jacob later said he served 14\\n    years for Laban’s two daughters and six years for Laban’s flock, the\\n    standard approach jumps to the conclusion that this request and Joseph’s\\n    birth occurred 14 years after Jacob joined Laban and six years before he\\n    departed from Laban. We will show that there were multiple wage contracts\\n    and clearly, this was not the one that began the final six years, thus\\n    invalidating their argument.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The relevant Scripture is found in Genesis 30-31:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>\\n    <strong>\\n        As soon as Rachel had borne Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, “Send me away,\\n        that I may go to my own home and country. <sup>26</sup>Give me my wives\\n        and my children for whom I have served you, that I may go, for you know\\n        the service that I have given you. <sup>27</sup>But Laban said to him,\\n        “[stay with me] …. <sup>28</sup>Name your wages…” Genesis 30:25-28.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>\\n        [Jacob said] “These twenty years I have been in your house. I served\\n        you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your\\n        flock, and you have changed my wages ten times.” Genesis 31:41.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    While their logic seems plausible, nowhere does Scripture say Joseph was\\n    born at the end of the fourteen years. Neither does it say that this labor\\n    contract began the six years for the flock. But it does quote Jacob twice\\n    saying that Laban changed his wages ten times (to his wives in 31:7 and to\\n    Laban in 31:41). Eleven contracts? Once a search is made for evidence of\\n    changed wages and Jacob’s claim is justified, we will realize that Ussher\\n    and followers commit the logical fallacies of jumping to conclusions and\\n    arguing from silence. So, when was the first agreement made? The last? And\\n    what about the one that is recorded?\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    We suggest that various informal arrangements were made and then broken by\\n    Laban before the most important one, the one that is recorded. Some were\\n    made even before the fourteen years were completed. This is suggested by\\n    Jacob’s later angry response to Laban:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong><sup>38</sup></strong>\\n    <strong>\\n        These twenty years I have been with you. Your ewes and your female\\n        goats have not miscarried, and I have not eaten the rams of your\\n        flocks. <sup>39</sup>What was torn by wild beasts I did not bring to\\n        you. I bore the loss of it myself. From my hand you required it,\\n        whether stolen by day or stolen by night. <sup>40</sup>There I was: by\\n        day the heat consumed me, and the cold by night, and my sleep fled from\\n        my eyes. Genesis 31:38-40.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    How could Jacob bear the loss? How could it be required of his hand if he\\n    had no sheep or goats of his own to pay with before those final six years?\\n    Females were kept to multiply the flock while males were eaten, but Jacob,\\n    in spite of having a growing household, ate none of Laban’s goats. Only if\\n    Laban paid Jacob with animals or allowed Jacob to begin building a flock of\\n    his own during those fourteen years could he feed his family and repay\\n    Laban for animals that had been torn or stolen.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    At the fourteen year mile stone a more formal arrangement was made so he\\n    could begin to acquire camels and cows as well as flocks. While Scripture\\n    does not record this agreement, it alludes to such an arrangement with the\\n    words about serving six years for the flocks. But when Laban saw Jacob\\n    truly prospering, he would have repeated his practice of changing Jacob’s\\n    wages time and again.\\n</p>\\n<h3 align=\"left\">\\n    Wage Agreement Reported in Scripture\\n</h3>\\n<p>\\n    Finally when Joseph was born, Jacob became very assertive and said “Send me\\n    away.” This time Laban, fearing he was about to lose Jacob, let Jacob name\\n    his wages and Jacob stayed on. This is the wage arrangement reported in\\n    Genesis 30: 25-28. It happened just after the birth of Joseph. Dinah was\\n    born several months later. If the final six years were a rounded number and\\n    the actual duration were six years and three months, Jacob would have left\\n    Laban three and a half years after Dinah’s birth (according to our proposed\\n    scenario). When Jacob did leave, he left with an enormous number of\\n    healthy, young animals. Jacob’s practices did not produce this bounty. It\\n    came from God who provided both his enormous herds and his sons.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Why was Laban desperate to retain Jacob’s services? He himself said, “The\\n    LORD has blessed me because of you” (30:27). Jacob states this even more\\n    strongly: “For you had little before I came, and it has increased\\n    abundantly, and the LORD has blessed you wherever I turned” (30:30).\\n    Jacob’s service increased Laban’s wealth from “little” to “abundant.”\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    This recorded agreement was to begin by Jacob passing through all Laban’s\\n    flock and removing “every speckled, and spotted sheep and every black lamb,\\n    and the spotted and speckled among the goats” (Genesis 30:32) for himself.\\n    What actually happened? Somehow Laban distracted Jacob or took advantage of\\n    Jacob’s work schedule and while Jacob was busy with other things, Laban\\n    with his sons rushed out and removed all such sheep and goats and sent them\\n    far away with his sons so Jacob would never get any of them back. Laban\\n    violated that contract before the ink was dry.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    On average sheep produce lambs once a year although they can bear in both\\n    the spring and fall. Three years is about the minimum time to replace most\\n    of Laban’s black and white animals with striped and spotted animals by\\n    normal births, but with the hand of God guiding the genetics the process\\n    was miraculously shrunk into the available time.\\n</p>\\n<h3 align=\"left\">\\n    God Overrules Laban’s Wage Changes\\n</h3>\\n<p>\\n    Jacob tells Rachel and Leah about two other changes to his wages after the\\n    agreement recorded in Scripture: “If he (Laban) said, ‘The spotted shall be\\n    your wages,’ then all the flock bore spotted” (31:8). In other words, when\\n    Laban saw that all (or most of) of the kids were striped, mottled or\\n    spotted which he originally said would be Jacob’s wages, he reneged,\\n    limiting Jacob’s wages to just those with spots. Jacob continued: “if he\\n    said, ‘The striped shall be your wages’, then all the flock bore striped.”\\n    In other words, when Laban saw all the kids were spotted, he changed the\\n    wages to those kids with stripes and the next time around, all the kids\\n    were striped. Every time Laban changed Jacob’s wages, the flocks bred in\\n    Jacob’s favor! Jacob realized that God was doing this: “But God did not\\n    permit him to harm me” (31:7). God was overruling Laban’s changes. “Thus”\\n    (Jacob concluded) “God has taken away the livestock of your father and\\n    given them to me.” (31:8-9).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Even more evidence for the wage changing game comes in the form of a dream\\n    God gave Jacob. He told Rachel and Leah, “The angel of God said to me in\\n    the dream, ‘Jacob,’ and I said, ‘Here I am!’ And he said, ‘Lift up your\\n    eyes and see, all the goats that mate with the flock are striped, spotted,\\n    and mottled, for I have seen all that Laban is doing to you’” (31:11-12).\\n    What was God’s point? In the field all mating goats that were not\\n    completely black had been removed and set aside. But in the dream, all the\\n    remaining mating goats, the ones belonging to Laban, were also\\n    multicolored, thus insuring their kids would be multicolored and thus\\n    belong to Jacob. Jacob would understand the same thing to be true of the\\n    flocks of sheep.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Laban should have known that he couldn’t cheat God. God would simply have\\n    all the kids and lambs marked with Laban’s most recent wage change. When\\n    Jacob told Rachel and Leah his dream, they agreed with Jacob that they\\n    should move to Canaan, concluding that their father was cheating them out\\n    of what was rightfully theirs:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>\\n    <strong>\\nIs there any portion or inheritance left to us in our father’s house?        <sup>15</sup>Are we not regarded by him as foreigners? For he has sold\\n        us, and he has indeed devoured our money. <sup>16</sup>All the wealth\\n        that God has taken away from our father belongs to us and to our\\n        children. Genesis 31:14-16.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<h3>\\n    Time for Jacob to Leave\\n</h3>\\n<p>\\n    Sheep were sheared before the hot summer but after spring lambing. It could\\n    be this master contract was negotiated before spring birthing and shearing,\\n    allowing Jacob to accumulate his animals over four birthing seasons, even\\n    though only 3 ½ years passed. Thus when he left, most of his oldest animals\\n    were just over three years old and the youngest had been born within the\\n    previous three months.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Maybe this is why Laban removed the multicolored animals for himself once\\n    he realized that the animals had already mated the previous fall. The\\n    possibility of four birthing seasons would answer any who might maintain\\n    that Laban’s flocks couldn’t be transferred to Jacob in just three birthing\\n    seasons. As previously pointed out, the six years and twenty years are\\n    round numbers. The six years could be 6 ¼ years. The twenty years could be\\n    20 ¼ years. Leah’s daughter could have been born 9 ¾ years after Jacob\\n    received his wives. These number would provide 3 ½ years from this master\\n    contract until Jacob departed. In that case it could have involved four\\n    mating seasons and four birthing seasons.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    As God increased Jacob’s wealth, Jacob heard that the sons of Laban were\\n    saying, “Jacob has taken all that was our father’s” (Genesis 31:1).\\n    Further, Jacob saw “that Laban did not regard him with favor as before”\\n    (Genesis 31:2). An alarming number of Laban’s animals had become Jacob’s.\\n    He was no longer their workhorse, multiplying their wealth. Jacob\\n    attributed the deed to God: “God has taken away the livestock of your\\n    father and given them to me” (Genesis 31:9). But jealousy was replacing\\n    their approval of Jacob. Jealousy can be deadly. Jacob was in danger. At\\n    this point God told Jacob to return to his homeland (Genesis 31:3).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    But how could he leave? For twenty years Jacob had seen Laban’s\\n    highhandedness. He believed Laban would never let him return to Canaan with\\n    his family and wealth. Both he and Laban said as much. Laban later said,\\n    “You have driven away my daughters like captives…” Laban called Jacob’s\\n    children “my sons and my daughters...” (Genesis 31:26, 28). They didn’t\\n    belong to Jacob, they belonged to him and as head of the household, he\\n    intended to keep what was his. Further, he would threaten, “It is in my\\n    power to do you harm” (Genesis 31:29). Jacob would reply, “If the God of my\\n    father, the God of Abraham and the Fear of Isaac, had not been on my side,\\n    surely now you would have sent me away empty-handed” (Genesis 31:42). This\\n    was the power of the patriarch. Laban could allow Jacob to go out with his\\n    family and wealth or let him leave empty-handed. Jacob had no choice but to\\n    flee secretly. Laban pursued and overtook Jacob. God intervened. Jacob was\\n    able to keep his family and newly formed wealth.\\n</p>\\n<h3 align=\"left\">\\n    Counting Jacob’s Wealth\\n</h3>\\n<p>\\n    How much had God given Jacob? How many animals did Jacob have to move?\\n    Genesis 30:43 reports that Jacob “increased greatly and had large flocks,\\n    female servants and male servants, and camels and donkeys.” In Genesis 32:5\\n    he sent the following word to Esau: “I have oxen, donkeys, flocks, male\\n    servants and female servants.” He gave the following present to his brother\\n    Esau:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>\\n    <strong>\\n        two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and\\n        twenty rams, <sup>15</sup>thirty milking camels and their calves, forty\\n        cows and ten bulls, twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys. Genesis\\n        32:14-15.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Jacob’s gift amounted to 550 animals plus calves. At Bethel he promised God\\n    a tenth if God returned him (Genesis 28:22-22). If this was that tenth, he\\n    possessed over 5000 animals—which was nearly half as many animals as Job\\n    had before Satan’s attack—most of Jacob’s acquired in just six years!\\n    Indeed, only God could have provided such increase.\\n</p>\\n<h3>\\n    Jacob’s Escape: How Do the Numbers Work Out?\\n</h3>\\n<p>\\n    Multiplying Jacob’s livestock was one thing. Returning them to the home of\\n    his father was another. How did Jacob do it? Here is a possible scenario:\\n    Jacob’s nursing flocks could cover ten miles at most in a day without\\n    injury. It was about 500 land miles to his father in Hebron and almost 400\\n    miles to the hill country of Gilead where Jacob thought he might be safe.\\n    Yet it was there that Laban and his kinsmen overtook Jacob. How could Jacob\\n    have gotten so far in such a short time? Or did he have more time?\\n    Scripture sometimes summarizes an event that involved much more than is\\n    stated as we shall shortly see.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    But first, Jacob’s escape and Laban’s pursuit:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>\\n    <strong>\\n        So Jacob arose and set his sons and his wives on camels. <sup>18</sup>\\n        He drove away all his livestock, all his property that he had gained,\\n        the livestock in his possession that he had acquired in Paddan-aram, to\\n        go to the land of Canaan to his father Isaac.... <sup>21</sup>He fled\\n        with all that he had and arose and crossed the Euphrates, and set his\\n        face toward the hill country of Gilead. <sup>22</sup>When it was told\\n        Laban on the third day that Jacob had fled, <sup>23</sup>He took his\\n        kinsmen with him and pursued him [Jacob] for seven days and followed\\n        close after him into the hill country of Gilead. Genesis 31:17-18,\\n        21-23.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Three critical details are disclosed in these verses. First, he had camels\\n    for transportation which meant great speed. Second, he had to cross the\\n    Euphrates which was the major barrier between Haran and Hebron. Third, his\\n    goal was to reach the hill country of Gilead.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>The Route to Home</strong>\\n    <strong></strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The standard trade route from Haran to Egypt involved crossing the\\n    Euphrates river at the last down river place it could be forded on foot—the\\n    ancient city of Carchemish, 65 miles due west of Haran. From the story of\\n    Joseph being sold by his brothers, we learn that shepherds took their\\n    flocks many miles to find pasture. Jacob would surely have located his\\n    flocks in the direction of the escape route. From Carchemish the trade\\n    route went southwest for 80 miles to Aleppo and then south another 35 to\\n    Ebla. The trade route continued directly south for another 170 miles to\\n    Damascus. Seventy-five miles beyond Damascus one reached the hill country\\n    of Gilead which was directly east of the Sea of Galilee in the Jordan Rift\\n    Valley.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    However, determining specifics are difficult since at least three unknowns\\n    are involved in Jacob’s return home. First, we only know the general area\\n    of Laban’s ranch—Paddan-aram and Haran. Paddan-aram was a region while\\n    Haran was the major supply center on the trade route. The ranch could have\\n    been 20-30 miles from Haran. Second, we do not know for sure that Jacob\\n    crossed at the common fording of Carchemish. While that was the normal\\n    fording point a millennium later, the river could have changed much between\\n    Jacob’s day and when better records were kept later. Third, we do not know\\n    where along the hills of Gilead Laban finally overtook Jacob. Four hundred\\n    years later that area was given to two and a half of the twelve tribes. At\\n    that time it was generally to the east of the Sea of Galilee. But it is\\n    possible that in Jacob’s day the area nominally extended north for a\\n    distance. Thus our best effort is an estimated 400 miles from Laban’s ranch\\n    to the point where he overtook Jacob.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    When God told Jacob to return home He added, “I will be with you” (Genesis\\n    31:3). Jacob would have divine protection. Nevertheless, Jacob had to plan\\n    his escape carefully. He waited until Laban would be shearing his sheep\\n    several days journey away from the ranch. He sent for his wives (possibly\\n    as Laban was setting out) to join him for a secret meeting in the fields.\\n    Laban’s household must not know. Jacob made his case for fleeing. Once his\\n    wives consented each began the extensive preparations for the journey\\n    (keeping their secret from Laban’s people).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Moving Sheep and Goats</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Jacob’s first concern would be to get the sheep and goats moving because\\n    with nursing young they could hardly do ten miles a day. Cattle are good\\n    for twice that while camels can be used for rapid travel. Since Scripture\\n    states that Laban overtook Jacob in the hills of Gilead after a seven day\\n    pursuit and this appears to have been nearly 400 miles, the flocks must\\n    have been on the road at least 40 days. So how does this work?\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Once Jacob secured his wives agreement to leave Laban, he would have worked\\n    at getting the flocks across the Euphrates. This means he would have\\n    accompanied the shepherds for this most difficult task. If his flocks were\\n    already grazing a three days’ journey west of Laban’s ranch, he would have\\n    spent most of a week getting them to and safely across the Euphrates. He\\n    would not be missed at the ranch as he was often in the fields with the\\n    flocks for periods of time.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Today, for several miles near Carchemish the Euphrates divides into two\\n    channels with an island between the channels. Possibly at one place one\\n    could wade across the first channel, then find a shallow part of the second\\n    channel somewhere else to wade across. We don’t know. Only the Scripture\\n    makes a point of saying that Jacob got all he had across the Euphrates.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Then he would cover the distance back to the ranch in two days to get his\\n    herds on the trail. This may have taken another week. By then the sheep and\\n    goats, divided into many flocks, would be 160 miles from the ranch (7 + 2 +\\n    7 = 16 days). Then Jacob would continue his plans to flee with his\\n    remaining household—wives, children, kindred and servants—closing out their\\n    lives in Haran and preparing for the long, perilous journey ahead. Possibly\\n    a trusted servant had been moving back and forth between the flocks, herds\\n    and ranch (on camel back) while Jacob’s household prepared. By one excuse\\n    or another to Laban’s people he may have been able to send off donkey\\n    trains of possessions during that week. When they were ready, possibly a\\n    week or so after the cattle left, Jacob’s wives must have said their\\n    goodbyes. With that Jacob put his family on camels and his household moved\\n    out. Laban’s people sent a runner to tell Laban. By this time the sheep\\n    would be 230 miles away (16 + 7 = 23 days).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Camels were the finest all around transportation in this part of the\\n    ancient world. In a caravan with heavy loads they typically covered 25\\n    miles a day or three miles an hour. They actually could walk all day at\\n    four miles an hour, but to conserve their energy, the drivers walked rather\\n    than rode. This slowed the caravan down to the pace and endurance of the\\n    drivers. Camels had been known to travel a hundred miles a day when\\n    employed for military purposes.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Laban’s Pursuit</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    On the third day Laban received word that Jacob had fled. Laban was\\n    shearing sheep. For Laban to take action, he first arranged care for the\\n    sheep being sheared, then made the three day journey back to the ranch and\\n    then organized an armed pursuit party on camels. Jacob would have about a\\n    ten day head start but that would not alarm Laban since the sheep with\\n    recently born lambs could only travel ten miles a day at most. What Laban\\n    had not counted on was that Jacob had sent the sheep ahead before returning\\n    to the ranch. By the time Laban was ready to pursue, the sheep were on the\\n    trail the equivalent of 33 days, 330 miles from Haran (23 + 3 +2 +3 + 2 =\\n    33 days). Meanwhile the herds had been on the trail 17 days so they would\\n    soon catch up with the flocks. Jacob and family had been on the trail ten\\n    days and were a good 250-300 miles from Haran. With camels they would soon\\n    catch up with the flocks, herds and donkey trains.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Scripture says it took Laban seven days to overtake Jacob. Just days\\n    before, Jacob’s cattle, donkeys and camels had all caught up with his\\n    flocks and they were now in the hill country of Gilead, 400 miles from\\n    Haran. Just as Jacob thought he was safe, Laban and his band appeared.\\n    While Laban had expected to find them just 170 miles from his ranch, it\\n    probably did not take him long to learn they were a great distance ahead of\\n    him so he would have gone into a forced day and night march. Even so for\\n    Laban to cover 400 miles in seven days, his camel army would have had to\\n    cover a punishing 55 miles a day. What an amazing flight on Jacob’s part.\\n    What an amazing pursuit on Laban’s part.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Nevertheless it was not that Jacob had reached familiar ground that\\n    protected him but none other than God Himself who appeared to Laban in a\\n    dream and warned him not to harm Jacob. In the end Laban and Jacob\\n    covenanted not to cross into each other’s lands for harm. Laban kissed his\\n    grandchildren and daughters and returned home. Again the angels of God\\n    appeared to Jacob. (Genesis 32:1). God was doing as He had originally\\n    promised at Bethel.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Esau Advances with 400 Men</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Then Jacob learned that his twin brother Esau was coming with a small army.\\n    He sent everyone ahead and was left alone. Yet he was not alone. He\\n    wrestled all night. The struggle was both spiritual and physical.\\n    “Wrestling” suggests a night of fervent prayer. Yet he sustained a lifetime\\n    physical injury. In the end his opponent said “Your name shall no longer be\\n    called Jacob, but Israel, for you have striven with God and with men, and\\n    have prevailed.” (Genesis 32:28). The new name has the connotation of power\\n    with God. Following this Jacob said, “I have seen God face to face and yet\\n    my life has been delivered” (Genesis 32:30). Jacob had encountered the\\n    preincarnate Christ.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Esau and his 400 men arrived. It looked like the end. Instead, “Esau ran to\\n    meet him and embraced him and fell on his neck, and kissed him, and they\\n    wept” (Genesis 33:4). Of this Jacob said: “I have seen your face, which is\\n    like seeing the face of God, and you have accepted me” (Genesis 33:10).\\n    Each visitation from God strengthened Jacob’s faith.\\n</p>\\n<h4>\\n    Dinah’s Humiliation\\n</h4>\\n<h4>\\n    Instead of returning to his father in Hebron for some unexplained reason\\n    Jacob bought land and settled in Shechem for the next 12 years. Then his\\n    daughter Dinah “went out to see the women of the land” (Genesis 34:1).\\n    Dinah was now old enough to socialize with the village women. The text does\\n    not mention an escort. Genesis 34:2 continues: “When Shechem the son of\\n    Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the land, saw her, he seized her and lay\\n    with her and humiliated her.” Having eleven older brothers she was used to\\n    receiving a lot of attention from boys and undoubtedly knew how to give and\\n    take a lot of innocent playfulness. Whatever he saw attracted him like a\\n    fly to flypaper. Then he lost control.\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\n    At the least we can observe that Dinah acted indiscreetly. “Going out to\\n    see the women” suggests inexperience, an enlarging of her world. In all\\n    this visiting she must have met Shechem. She was poised, self-confident, a\\n    talker and playful. Maybe Shechem misinterpreted her innocent fun for\\n    something more. We have suggested she was fifteen years old. If she were\\n    older, she would know more about men outside of her family and be more\\n    careful. If she were much younger, she would be less desired as his wife.\\n    At fifteen she was a grown woman capable of marriage and suitable as a mate\\n    for the young prince. Fifteen fits the Scriptural chronology.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Dinah had six natural older brothers while Jacob’s other five sons were her\\n    step-brothers. Her oldest natural brother and Jacob’s first was Reuben. He\\n    was nine years older than her. Her brothers were beyond indignant. Shechem\\n    loved Dinah and asked his father to get her for his wife. When Shechem’s\\n    father asked Jacob to let his daughter marry his son, he said the two\\n    peoples could become one. Jacob’s sons said the Hivites would have to be\\n    circumcised first. So, all the men of the village were circumcised. Then\\n    two of Dinah’s natural brothers came and murdered all the men when they\\n    were in the most pain. These brothers, Simeon and Levi, were 23 and 22,\\n    eight and seven years older than Dinah.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Thinking the sons had to be older people ask, “How could two young men kill\\n    all the men in an entire village?” First, they came on the third day when\\n    the men were sore. Intense pain can incapacitate. The village men had no\\n    strength to fight back. Second, this question reinforces an earlier\\n    suggestion in this paper, that Abraham had gained military training in Ur.\\n    When he left Ur, he trained every able bodied male in his household in the\\n    art of defense. When the Jordan Valley was invaded and Lot was taken\\n    prisoner, Abraham “led forth his trained men, born in his house, 318 of\\n    them…” and with allies, completely vanquished an experienced, professional\\n    army (Genesis 14:14). That a 23 and 22 year old could put an entire village\\n    to the sword suggests Jacob also trained his sons in the use of the sword.\\n    Today 23 and 22 year old college football players display the kind of\\n    strength and determination that Jacob’s sons displayed. The other side sees\\n    the need for the sons to be seven years older, but they didn’t need to be\\n    30 and 29 to wreak this havoc on the village.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    While the slaughter at Shechem possibly doubled Jacob’s wealth, his focus\\n    was on his and his family’s survival. He was angry and terrified expecting\\n    revenge from the Shechemites’ fellow Canaanites. Little did he know that\\n    God would command Israel to destroy the Canaanite population five hundred\\n    years later. Could it be that the act of Simeon and Levi was divine\\n    judgment to break the hold of paganism on its surviving residents (over\\n    half of its population) and give them the opportunity to meet the true God\\n    and receive eternal life?\\n</p>\\n<h4>\\n    Returning to Bethel, the “House of God”\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\n    Jacob was appalled at his sons’ action. After slaughtering the adult males\\n    of an entire village, all of his sons plundered what was left and took the\\n    wives and children. He said to Simeon and Levi, “You have brought trouble\\n    on me by making me stink to the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites and\\n    the Perizzites. My numbers are few, and if they gather themselves against\\n    me and attack me, I shall be destroyed, both I and my household” (Genesis\\n    34:30). Jacob must have cried out to God because we next read “God said to\\n    Jacob, ‘Arise, go up to Bethel [Hebrew: beth-house; el-God; thus “house of\\n    God”] and dwell there. Make an altar there to the God who appeared to you\\n    when you fled from your brother Esau’” (Genesis 35:1).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Bethel would allow a time of renewal and mark another step of faith. Jacob\\n    told his household and all who were with him, “Put away the foreign gods\\n    that are among you and purify yourselves and change your garments. Then let\\n    us arise and go up to Bethel, so that I may make there an altar to the God\\n    who answers me in the day of my distress and has been with me wherever I\\n    have gone” (Genesis 35:2-3). With him were his household plus many new\\n    faces--all those in the plunder of Shechem for Scripture previously\\n    reported: “They (Jacob’s sons) took their flocks and their herds, their\\n    donkeys, and whatever was in the city and in the field. All their wealth,\\n    all their little ones and their wives, all that was in the houses, they\\n    captured and plundered” (34:28-29).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Everyone with him was to put away the false gods, follow rites of cleansing\\n    and change their clothes in preparation for meeting the LORD. Jacob buried\\n    these instruments of idolatry and left for Bethel (Genesis 35:4). Along the\\n    way the Canaanites did not attack them. Instead “a terror from God fell\\n    upon the cities that were around them, so that they did not pursue the sons\\n    of Jacob” (Genesis 35:6). At Bethel he built an altar. God confirmed the\\n    Abrahamic Covenant to him (Genesis 35:11-12). The newcomers learned that\\n    God must be approached through the blood of a sacrifice as man had done\\n    since the time of Abel. With the death of Jesus the Christ, man learned\\n    that Old Testament sacrifices offered in faith were pictures of that one\\n    vicarious sacrifice for all time. When Jacob left home bound for his\\n    mother’s people, God appeared in a dream to Jacob, repeated the promises of\\n    land and population made to Abraham and the certainty that Jacob would\\n    return to this very place. Now, 32 years later God repeated those promises:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>\\n    <strong>\\n        I am God Almighty [El Shaddai]: be fruitful and multiply. A nation and\\n        a company of nations shall come from you, and kings shall come from\\n        your own body. <sup>12</sup>The land that I gave to Abraham and Isaac,\\n        I will give to you, and I will give the land to your offspring after\\n        you. Genesis 35:11-12.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    God identified Himself as “El Shaddai,” the all-powerful God. No less than\\n    the One who created all things in six days stood behind these promises to\\n    Abraham, Isaac and now Jacob. The women and children of Shechem had been\\n    the pitiful victims of idolatry. Here they learned about the true God.\\n    Certainly many of them believed in Him and entered His Kingdom that day.\\n</p>\\n<h4>\\n    Why All the Haggling Over the Events After Jacob Left Home?\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\n    The Ussher crowd feel compelled to change the story to fit the numbers. We\\n    agree that the birth of 12 children might be viewed as consecutive and thus\\n    produce the idea of marrying Leah and Rachel at the beginning of the\\n    fourteen years. We agree that placing the reported work contract at the\\n    beginning of the final six years might be understood from Scripture. We\\n    agree that later events require the children to be as old as possible when\\n    Jacob left Haran. But we have shown those devices are ruled out by\\n    Scripture. Our scheme suggests all twelve children were born in the ten\\n    years following Jacob’s first seven years of labor, leaving three plus\\n    years for God to work the miracle of the flocks’ markings (7+10+3=20). This\\n    would mean Joseph and Dinah were a little over three years old when the\\n    family left Haran and Zebulun was only 15 months older.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    This view of their ages seems to be confirmed when Esau came to meet Jacob.\\n    Esau suggested they go the rest of the way together. Jacob replied, “The\\n    children are frail and the nursing flocks and herds are a care to me”\\n    (Genesis 33:13). “Frail” is probably an exaggeration but it suggests the\\n    youngest were still little ones, not much further along in development than\\n    the recently born sheep and goats. “Children” suggests that more than one\\n    child fit into this category. Viewing both Joseph and Dinah to be about\\n    three years old fits this statement nicely and makes her about fifteen when\\n    she was violated. She can’t have been much older when she was humbled\\n    because about two years later Joseph was sold into slavery at the age of\\n    seventeen (Genesis 37:2).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Is all this bickering necessary—when Jacob got his wives, whether the\\n    children were born one after another or some at the same time, Dinah’s age\\n    when she was raped, etc.? After all, what’s a few years? First, trifling\\n    with Scripture is no small matter. Second, determining when Joseph was born\\n    provides great insight into the chronology of Jacob’s life. Their view\\n    makes the first four boys seven years older than the view that follows\\n    Scripture. This changing of Scripture ultimately supports their view of how\\n    to take Hebrew genealogies and the idea that Scripture reveals the age of\\n    the earth within a few years. Changing the record is a critical issue.\\n</p>\\n<h3>\\n    Final Years of Jacob\\n</h3>\\n<p>\\n    Tears also were shed at Bethel. There Deborah, Rebekah’s nurse died and was\\n    buried under an oak. The place was named “Allon-bacuth” (oak of weeping;\\n    Genesis 35:8). Possibly this woman had cared for Jacob in his infancy and\\n    his mother as she aged. She was a pleasant reminder of his parent’s home\\n    before he fled from Esau 32 years before. During this long absence Rebekah\\n    died and her nurse came to help with all the children born to Jacob. Now\\n    just weeks before they arrived back at Hebron and rejoined his aged father,\\n    more tears.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    More tears a short distance further. Jacob’s beloved Rachel went into labor\\n    near Bethlehem which was called Ephrath in those days. Rachel had prayed\\n    for another son (Genesis 30:24) and now God answered. The child Benjamin\\n    lived, but his mother died in childbirth. This was Jacob’s twelfth and last\\n    son. Over a thousand years later Micah would prophecy that the most\\n    significant son in all human history would be born there. The second person\\n    of the godhead, God the Son, would become clothed with humanity in that\\n    very place.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    But you, O Bethlehem Ephrathah, who are too little to be among the clans of\\n    Judah, from you shall come forth for me one who is to be ruler in Israel,\\n    whose coming forth is from of old, from ancient days. Micah 5:2.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    In a single verse (Genesis 35:22) Scripture reports another heartbreak\\n    Jacob suffered. His oldest son committed fornication with his beloved\\n    wife’s handmaid, Bilhah. It was like violating the memory of Rachel.\\n    Scripture calls her “his father’s concubine.” Most likely, Bilhah bore some\\n    of Jacob’s daughters. We don’t hear any more of this until Jacob blesses\\n    his sons on his death bed. There he says,\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <sup>3</sup>\\n    Reuben, you are my firstborn, my might and the firstfruits of my strength,\\n    preeminent in dignity and preeminent in power. <sup>4</sup>Unstable as\\n    water, you shall not have preeminence, because you went up to your father’s\\n    bed; then you defiled it—he went up to my couch! Genesis 49:2-3.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Finally, Jacob arrived “at Mamre, or Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron), where\\n    Abraham and Isaac had sojourned. Now the days of Isaac were 180 years. And\\n    Isaac breathed his last, and he died and was gathered to his people, old\\n    and full of days. And his sons Esau and Jacob buried him” (Genesis\\n    35:27-29). Jacob had spent 20 years with Laban and another 12 in Canaan. He\\n    was 106 and his father was 166. Fourteen years later his father died and\\n    the twins buried him.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Genesis 35, what an eventful chapter—Jacob returning to Bethel, God Himself\\n    bearing the name El Shaddai restating the promises, the birth of Benjamin\\n    and those final years with his father Isaac. But they were also painful\\n    times in his life: the death of his mother’s nurse who related to Jacob\\n    memories of those years of his mother’s life he would otherwise never know\\n    since he never saw her after he fled 32 years before. It tells of the death\\n    of the joy of his life, Rachel. It tells of Reuben’s moral failure. He was\\n    the one who should have led the nation that God would make Abraham into.\\n    Reuben lost the family priesthood to Levi, the double portion to Joseph and\\n    the right to rule the nation to Judah.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    During Jacob’s 32 year absence Esau lived for a time with his parents,\\n    Isaac and Rebekah, who must have harbored a deep, quiet grief for Jacob.\\n    Esau no longer had to compete with Jacob who seemed unmatchable. As he\\n    became the sole heir of all his father had, he mellowed. Apparently, he\\n    eventually showed interest in the stories of God’s appearances to his\\n    grandfather and father and finally believed. After 20 years of absence, he\\n    welcomed Jacob home with tears, forgiving his brother who had purchased his\\n    birthright and stolen his father’s blessing. God honored Esau with an\\n    entire chapter of the Bible, a long one at that, devoted to a 500-year\\n    record of his descendants (Genesis 36).\\n</p>\\n<h4 align=\"center\">\\n    Joseph: Favorite, Slave, Ruler\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\n    Everyone knows how Joseph told his dreams to his family—in his dreams they\\n    actually bowed down to him! Many commentators have pointed out this would\\n    not be well received. But what may be missed in the picture is that Jacob\\n    was no longer spry. He had become increasingly dependent on others. He no\\n    longer spent his time in the fields. As he watched his sons, he saw their\\n    various abilities—strength, energy, devotion, intelligence and even their\\n    management weaknesses. Of them all, Joseph had the sharpest eyes and the\\n    best ideas. Joseph saw poor shepherding practices and reported them to\\n    Jacob. Undoubtedly when Jacob tried to correct them, the brothers came to\\n    realize that Joseph was telling on them.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Jacob no longer had his precious Rachel, but he had her son who reminded\\n    him of the qualities he saw in her. He couldn’t hide it. Joseph was his\\n    favorite, brilliant like his father, in a class all of his own. Someone had\\n    to be Jacob’s go between; keep tabs on what his sons were doing. Without\\n    supervision the flocks would remain mediocre or even decrease. So Jacob\\n    dressed Joseph in that distinctive robe of many colors indicating some kind\\n    of position or authority. Lacking the humility that accompanies\\n    righteousness his brothers hated him.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Most people who are familiar with the Bible know what happened next. His\\n    father sent him to check on his brothers. Joseph was 17. His father would\\n    not see him again for another 22 years. Joseph found his brothers way up in\\n    Dothan, an area even north of Shechem. Possibly the summer was unusually\\n    dry so they had moved the flocks 60 miles north of Hebron to find suitable\\n    pasture for their sheep. The brothers saw Jacob coming, put him in a well\\n    and when Midianite traders came along sold him into slavery. They took his\\n    colored coat, dipped it in blood and showed Jacob. Jacob was convinced\\n    Joseph had been eaten by a wild animal. Scripture describes how the loss\\n    affected him:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <sup>34</sup>\\n    Then Jacob tore his garments and put sackcloth on his loins and mourned for\\n    his son many days. <sup>35</sup>All his sons and all his daughters rose up\\n    to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted and said, “No, I shall go\\n    down to Sheol to my son, mourning.” Thus his father wept for him. Genesis\\n    37:34-35.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The writer of sacred writ turns aside for a moment from Joseph to devote an\\n    entire chapter to another unfolding event “at that time” (Genesis 38:1).\\n    Sometime around when Joseph was sold into slavery at the age of 17, Judah,\\n    Jacob’s fourth oldest son, at about the age of 23 married a Canaanite woman\\n    with whom he fathered three sons—Er, Onan and Shelah. When the oldest\\n    arrived at a marriageable age, Judah arranged for him to marry Tamar, a\\n    Canaanite woman. In time the son acted wickedly and God slew him. Tamar was\\n    given to the second and over time he did the same. Judah told Tamar to\\n    remain a widow until his youngest son was of age. Then Judah’s wife died.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Grieving Judah went with his Adullamite friend Hirah to shear his sheep.\\n    Tamar heard of his plans. Realizing that the third son was not being given\\n    to her, she dressed as a prostitute and stationed herself where he would\\n    pass. Grieving Judah in a moment of weakness seized this easy opportunity\\n    and went in to her, not realizing this was his daughter-in-law. Later he\\n    learned she was pregnant and ordered her execution. Then he learned who the\\n    father was and declared she was more righteous than he. He never touched\\n    her again but she delivered twins and the line of Christ passed through\\n    one. The story had to be told or there would forever be a question about\\n    how the line of Christ could pass through Judah and his daughter-in-law.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    A byproduct of this event is insight into Hebrew genealogies. Here are the\\n    biblical numbers: Jacob spent 20 years with uncle Laban. Twelve years later\\n    Dinah was raped and the Shechemites were slaughtered. We estimate that both\\n    she and Joseph were about fifteen at the time. Joseph was sold into slavery\\n    two years later. Just 22 years after that when Judah was 45 Jacob moved his\\n    household to Egypt. Since Genesis 38 begins “At that time” and follows\\n    Genesis 37 which tells the story of selling Joseph into slavery, we cannot\\n    give the exact year but it had to be close to when Joseph was betrayed at\\n    the age of 17 and Judah was about 23. Just 22 years later Jacob would move\\n    his brood to Egypt.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Here is the interesting thing: in approximately 22 years Judah fathered\\n    three sons. In the next 20 years each in his turn grew to adulthood and two\\n    married. Tamar was married to the first, then the second. Then Judah\\n    unintentionally fathered twins by her as he was beguiled by her prostitute\\n    outfit and hurting from the loss of his wife. The list of those\\n    accompanying Jacob to Egypt (Genesis 46:8-27) includes, of course, Judah.\\n    He would have been about 45. It also lists his three sons but notes that\\n    two died in the land of Canaan. Since the first two reached adulthood, were\\n    married one after the other to the Canaanite woman Tamar, Judah would have\\n    been between the ages of 23 and 25 when they were born. Then he impregnated\\n    Tamar and a second set of sons was born to him, the twins Perez and Zerah.\\n    The list even includes two sons of Perez, Hezron and Hamul.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Our first lesson is that at least some of Jacob’s sons/grandsons were\\n    marrying early, very early, like at the age of 17 or 18 whereas those first\\n    seven named generations born after the Flood all started families between\\n    the ages of 29 and 34. We only mention this now. It will all be developed\\n    fully in later chapters. Our second lesson is that the twins were either\\n    infants or still in Tamar’s womb when Jacob moved his family to Egypt. This\\n    point should make us cautious about how to take the list of those Jacob\\n    took to Egypt.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Our third lesson is that two sons of Perez are also found in the list\\n    (Genesis 46:12). Clearly, they were unborn at the time of the move. Yet\\n    Scripture says “All the persons belonging to Jacob who came into Egypt, who\\n    were his own descendants…were 66 persons in all” (Genesis 46:26). How could\\n    they possibly go down to Egypt when they were not even alive?\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Obviously Hebrew genealogies have a different purpose than those of most\\n    peoples. Judah, his son Perez, and grandson, Hezron, established the line\\n    of Christ in Israel. Recording them overrode the obvious fact that at least\\n    Hezron was not even conceived at the time of the move. Perez would not\\n    marry for another 15 or 20 years at the soonest to father his sons\\n    mentioned among the 66 who went with Jacob to Egypt. Obviously genealogies\\n    could include sons still in the loins of their father. This is not\\n    surprising when one considers that the primary purpose of Hebrew\\n    genealogies was identity not succession. In this case the Holy Spirit was\\n    establishing the clans of Jacob at the earliest possible opportunity. What\\n    better place to begin than when Jacob moved to Egypt?\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    One other note: Benjamin was born after the slaughter of the Shechemites,\\n    about 24 years before the move to Egypt. Ten sons are credited to him yet\\n    he is just 24 years old. Some must have been grandsons and thus still in\\n    the womb at the time of the move. It is also possible that a scribal error\\n    copied several sons that a later list ascribes to one of his brothers. We\\n    will look at this also.\\n</p>\\n<h3 align=\"left\">\\n    The Rise of Joseph\\n</h3>\\n<p>\\n    Now to gather lessons from Joseph. The Midianites sold him to the captain\\n    of pharaoh’s palace guard. We suggest that in no time the Midianites\\n    discovered this kid was pure gold. Not too many years later Potiphar\\n    discovered the same thing, entrusting his entire household to Joseph’s\\n    care. We all remember how Mrs. Potiphar thought he was a catch. For her\\n    indiscretion Joseph landed in the royal prison under Potiphar’s care. Maybe\\n    Potiphar put in some good words to the warden. Joseph came to be in charge\\n    of the crown’s personal prisoners.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Jacob had seen in Joseph a genius unlike any of his other sons. It is\\n    understandable that this aging man wanted his vast estate in the best\\n    possible hands. Too bad Joseph’s brothers lacked the necessary humility to\\n    allow this to happen. Fast forward thirteen years to the dream that drove\\n    Pharaoh crazy. Joseph not only interpreted the dream, but had an immediate\\n    plan of action for the coming famine. Pharaoh should find a wise man to\\n    collect the surplus grain during the good years. In that moment Pharaoh saw\\n    in Joseph someone who could do the job and promoted this prisoner on the\\n    spot to number two in the great empire of Egypt. Joseph was just 30 years\\n    old and nine years later would rescue his family from starvation. Jacob was\\n    right. Joseph had talent.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Like all aging fathers, Jacob became increasingly dependent on his\\n    household as the end drew near. When they moved to Egypt Jacob was 130\\n    years old. Genesis 46:5 reports “The sons of Israel carried Jacob their\\n    father, their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons that Pharaoh had\\n    sent to carry him.” He would die 17 years later.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Those who prefer numbers to words have reworked the scriptural account of\\n    Jacob to no avail. In this chapter we have upheld the following details in\\n    Jacob’s life\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    1. He served Laban seven years before he was given his wives, Leah and\\n    Rachel. Over the next approximately ten years he fathered twelve children\\n    by four women.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    2. Jacob states Laban changed his wages ten times. Five work contracts are\\n    stated or hinted at. After working fourteen years for his two wives, he\\n    served Laban six years for his flocks which he parleyed into herds, camels\\n    and donkeys as well. That work contract is not stated but is marked by the\\n    beginning of a six year period in which his pay would be in terms of\\n    livestock. About three years later Joseph was born and Laban offered the\\n    dream contract, one Jacob couldn’t refuse. This is the one recorded in\\n    detail (Genesis 30:25-34). About 3-3 ½ years later Jacob returned to\\n    Canaan.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    3. Unlike his brothers, Joseph was an administrative genius. When his aged\\n    father could no longer give personal supervision, he informally designated\\n    the second youngest brother as a sort of supervisor over his ten older\\n    brothers. Their reaction was predictable. They hated him. Maybe it somewhat\\n    had to do with a seething sense of injustice in the family, the way Jacob\\n    had treated their mother Leah in the early years versus the way he treated\\n    Joseph’s mother during that period. They sold Joseph into slavery. Just\\n    thirteen years later Joseph became the governor of Egypt under Pharaoh.\\n    Nine years after that when Joseph is 39, the family was reunited in Egypt.\\n    Jacob was 130. This means Jacob was 91 when Joseph was born and allows the\\n    fixing of times and ages—Jacob was 74 when he moved to Haran, 81 when he\\n    got his wives, 94 when he returned to Canaan. Joseph and Dinah were then\\n    possibly just over three years old.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    4. Scripture specifically says Joseph was 17 when his brothers betrayed\\n    him. This happened shortly after Dinah was raped in Shechem, certainly no\\n    more than two years after, making her about 15 when she was humbled. Also,\\n    about the time Joseph was enslaved the sordid tale of Judah began to unfold\\n    (Genesis 38). By the time he was 45, when they moved to Egypt, his three\\n    sons had been born, and the oldest two, Er and Onan were dead. Judah had\\n    impregnated Tamar, the former wife of Onan, and she had given birth to\\n    Perez and Zerah.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    5. Conclusion: Without forcing it, the biblical timeline works. No need to\\n    rewrite the words of Scripture to harmonize with its numbers. These events\\n    give us further insights into the character of Hebrew genealogies which\\n    come in the next chapters.\\n</p>\\n<h3>\\n    Early Biblical Chronology\\n</h3>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Chronology of Jacob’s Family</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Now we can calculate the critical mile markers in Jacob’s life within a\\n    year or so. Jacob was 130 when he was presented to Pharaoh (Genesis 47:9).\\n    Joseph was promoted by Pharaoh when he was 30 (Genesis 41:46). Seven years\\n    of plenty and two years of famine had passed before his family moved to\\n    Egypt (Genesis 45:6). This makes Joseph 39 when they arrived (30+7+2=39)\\n    and Jacob 91 when Joseph was born (130-39=91). Joseph was three years old\\n    when his family left Haran, so Jacob left Laban when he was 94 years old\\n    (91+3=94). Jacob served Laban 20 years so he left home at the age of 74\\n    (94-20=74). After serving Laban seven years he married Leah and Rachel at\\n    the age of 81 (74+7=81). Reuben was born when Jacob was 82 years old and\\n    thus Reuben was 48 years old when the family moved to Egypt (130-82=48).\\n    All these numbers are rounded and could be slightly off, but certainly not\\n    more than six to twelve months altogether. These critical events with their\\n    dates are grouped next: <strong></strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong> <u>Jacob’s Age</u> <u>Event or Period in Jacob’s Life</u></strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    0-74 Jacob, younger twin of Isaac and Rebekah, lives with parents\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    40 Jacob’s brother marries two Canaanite women who upset parents\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    40-74 Jacob sees their grief; chooses not to marry a Canaanite woman\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    74 Jacob leaves home (returns to Canaan 20 years later)\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    74-88 Jacob serves fourteen years for Laban’s two daughters\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    81 Marries Leah and Rachel after serving seven of the fourteen years\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    82 Fathers Reuben, his firstborn, by Leah\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    88-94 Jacob serves Laban six additional years for his flocks (contract not\\n    recorded)\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    91 Joseph and Dinah are born during this six year period\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    91 Dream work contract recorded in Genesis 30:25-43\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    94 Returns to Canaan after 20 years in Haran\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    94-130 Jacob lives in Canaan thirty-six years before moving to Egypt\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    94-106 Twelve years in Succoth and Shechem\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    106 Dinah raped at the age of 15.

That basic\\n    chronology is found in Appendix Table B.1 which begins with the commonly\\n    accepted date for the start of Solomon’s temple, 966 BC, adds the 480 years\\n    of I Kings 6:1 for the period of the Judges, adds the 430-year sojourn in\\n    Egypt, the 215-year sojourn in Canaan and the 75 years before Abraham\\n    reached Canaan. This basic chronology then becomes the foundation to a\\n    complete biblical chronology going back to Adam. But since that one must\\n    allow for the estimated missing names in Shem’s and Adam’s lists, it will\\n    not be fully explained until chapter 7. Nevertheless it stands as Appendix\\n    Tables B.2 and B.3 for those who want to peak ahead. Those numbers are\\n    placed in an easy to find location following the 20 arguments for\\n    abbreviated genealogies at the beginning of the Appendix.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    What an effort—nearly 40 pages to scrutinize details in the lives of\\n    Abraham and Jacob in order to overturn numerous faulty interpretations\\n    adopted to support 215-years in Egypt. With these errant interpretations\\n    corrected, we can now come to the heart of this book—the nature and\\n    function of Hebrew genealogies (chapter 5), over a dozen abbreviated\\n    genealogies (chapter 6) and the granddaddy of all abbreviated genealogies,\\n    that of Shem (chapter 7).\\n</p>\\n<br clear=\"all\"/>\\n<p>\\n    <strong> </strong>\\n</p>\\n<div>\\n    <br clear=\"all\"/>\\n    <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"/>\\n    <div id=\"ftn1\">\\n        <p>\\n            <a href=\"#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\" title=\"\">\\n                <sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup>\\n            </a>\\n            Merrill F.

Most importantly, God himself established\\n    them. In elegance they can be a long list of immediate father-son\\n    relationships or as brief as “Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of\\n    Abraham” (Matthew 1:1). Profound—they identify the fathers of post-Flood\\n    people groups that repopulated the world. Mysterious—they speak of ten sons\\n    accompanying 24-year old Benjamin to Egypt (a 24-year old with ten sons?).\\n    They also include the two unborn sons of baby Perez among the 66\\n    descendants of Jacob who went down to Egypt.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Flexible—they are not always a record of immediate father-son\\n    relationships; rather, they are elastic enough to include future\\n    descendants under the concept that all future generations are in the loins\\n    of their forefathers. In this way the record could be particularly tailored\\n    to meet the author’s purpose with remarkable efficiency.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    In purpose and function they provide identity and explanation—who am I?\\n    Where do I belong? How did it happen? With brevity they record: 1) the\\n    spread of man after the Flood; 2) Abraham’s ancestors; 3) Israel’s\\n    organization.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    A three-tier division of Jacob’s descendants (tribe/clan/household) insured\\n    brilliant organization and maximum security in the wilderness and fair\\n    division of the land in Canaan. In effect, the genealogies told each family\\n    where to pitch its tent in a camp of 2.5 million and where to settle down\\n    in the spacious Promised Land. They especially confirm that Jesus was truly\\n    human. While biblical genealogies have similarities to the genealogies of\\n    monarchial societies through the ages, they also have significant\\n    differences and must be explained in a way consistent with biblical use.\\n</p>\\n<h4>\\n    Genealogies Organized Israel\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\n    Free at last; no longer slaves under the yoke of Egypt. But what would keep\\n    these former slaves from exploiting each other as they had been exploited?\\n    In a word, genealogies. The ex-slaves had to think and act like free people\\n    and stand together as a nation. To keep them from destroying each other\\n    before they learned those new ways, genealogies helped organize them so\\n    they would live together in a civilized way.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    When God delivered Israel from Egypt, He gave Moses an amazingly simple yet\\n    efficient way to organize the people. He grouped them by tribe, clan, and\\n    households that contained even smaller divisions. At the center of the camp\\n    in the wilderness was the Tabernacle surrounded by an open area large\\n    enough to assemble the nation. Beyond that the three clans of Levi camped\\n    on three sides of the Tabernacle while the families of Moses and Aaron\\n    camped beyond the assembly area in front. Beyond the Levites was an\\n    assembly area for common activities. Beyond this, possibly a mile from the\\n    Tabernacle, began the camps of the people. Three tribes camped side by side\\n    on each of the four sides, radiating out like wedges. Each tribe was\\n    divided into three to six clans, approximately 50-60 clans in all. Clans\\n    ranged from 10,000 to 50,000 members. Divisions further extended to\\n    thousands, hundreds and tens. Adult males provided the basis for population\\n    counts.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Each person living in his own unit restrained theft and promoted acceptable\\n    behavior. Everyone knew the people around them. Their neighbors were their\\n    relatives. Each witnessed the other’s actions. Due to distances, people in\\n    one tribe had little association with people in another tribe. The life of\\n    each person centered around where his genealogy put him. Those Levites over\\n    the age of 50 were spared transporting the Tabernacle and became the guards\\n    at the heart of the nation. If an unauthorized person entered that inner\\n    circle, he was to be executed—except on those occasions where individuals\\n    or the entire nation were summoned to join Moses at the Tabernacle which\\n    was also called “The Tent of Meeting.” One didn’t just wander anywhere\\n    through the camp. People were born, married and died in their own\\n    organizational unit.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    So, a person’s genealogy told him who he was, where he belonged, where he\\n    placed his tent and who his neighbors would be. Slaves could be ornery,\\n    stubborn. Sometimes it took a whip to keep them in line. Now the whip was\\n    gone. Genealogies were doing what the whip had done. Yes, the people were\\n    free from servitude in Egypt, but their freedom had limits. They didn’t\\n    have to work for others twelve hours a day and they didn’t have to spend\\n    their days confined to the work area of a slave gang, but God put an\\n    impressive amount of structure in their lives. Can we picture it?\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    When this sea of people arrived at a new location, they set up their unit\\n    in relation to the whole. Tribal and clan leaders designated areas for\\n    tents, established corridors, marked and cleared open spaces for manna,\\n    designated the special places outside the camp and set up necessary\\n    services for the function of each unit. With practice they became\\n    efficient. The Tabernacle, first assembly space, Levite tent area and\\n    second open area must have stretched a mile in every direction from the\\n    center, the Tabernacle. Then came the tribes divided into clans and clans\\n    divided into households radiating out for another three miles or so.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    To be sure, there was more desirable real estate. The tribal and clan heads\\n    pitched their tents nearest the Tabernacle. Those of lesser position tented\\n    further out in their clan’s living space. If the farthest tents were four\\n    miles from the Tabernacle, all people could collect at the Tabernacle and\\n    return to their tents the same day. This walk probably motivated families\\n    to earn the right to camp closer to the front of their tribe’s wedge. This\\n    densely packed part of the camp would cover an area of over 50 square miles\\n    (eight miles across or 4<sup>2</sup>*3.14).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Joshua 7:24 says Achan had “oxen, donkeys and sheep.” If these animals were\\n    kept in the camp their manure would foul the manna and the camp would be\\n    hopelessly spread out. More likely the herds and flocks were kept in\\n    specially designated areas outside the camp proper. Other specially\\n    designated areas would have been used for temporarily unclean individuals,\\n    for lepers, for burying the dead or disposing of waste, among others. These\\n    specially designated areas could have occupied a band three miles across\\n    outside the living area. A camp 14 miles in diameter would have an area of\\n    150 square miles, the inner 50 for living and the outer 100 for specially\\n    designated functions. This vast distance was good reason that people mostly\\n    lived and mixed within their designated areas—tribes, clans, households,\\n    etc.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>Daily Life in the Wilderness</strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Picture the people rising early to gather their daily portion of manna.\\n    Their desire for manna that was still fresh before the heat of the day\\n    spoiled it would have been adequate motivation to brave the nippy early\\n    morning desert cold. Perhaps each person spent the first hour or more of\\n    daylight to gather one day’s worth. In this way God saw to it that each\\n    individual exercised daily. If one area was gathered clean, people would\\n    have to search for areas that still had a supply. Manna was a perfect food\\n    but most likely the effort required to gather it limited over eating and\\n    thus becoming overweight.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Then people would relax while they enjoyed the first meal of the day and\\n    chatted about the daily tasks needing attention. Women, of course, would be\\n    caring for young children. Waste had to be carried to designated areas and\\n    buried. Just carrying water might occupy hours of a teenaged sibling. The\\n    people gathered wood, bartered and traded services and cooked meals while\\n    the 600,000 men of the camp conducted their morning military drills. Many\\n    serviced their herds and flocks while others developed professions and\\n    specialties. Maybe all this was done before the sun was high in the sky and\\n    it was time for a long afternoon nap. There were many special days, days\\n    for instruction, days for their religious life and plenty of time to get\\n    into trouble for those so inclined. So went life for that vast multitude,\\n    thankfully protected by cloud from the burning daytime sun and by the\\n    pillar of fire during the cold desert night.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Moses had an army to train and command. Like all generals he needed to know\\n    how many troops were available for the day. Most likely it was a day for\\n    training, but it might be a day for action. He must have taken a “morning\\n    report” as military commanders generally do. How would it work? Possibly at\\n    a certain time the horns were blown at headquarters for the morning report.\\n    The horns at each tribe a mile from the Tent of Meeting would repeat the\\n    call. Those in charge of ten had already made the rounds to determine the\\n    able bodied. When the horns sounded, each sprinted off to his captain of\\n    100 with his report.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The captain of 100 made a quick tabulation and hurried to the next level,\\n    the captain of a thousand. Those reports went to the clan leaders who most\\n    likely were near the tents of the tribal leaders. The tribal leaders made\\n    their tallies and sent them with runners to the Tent of Meeting. Possibly\\n    this was all accomplished in just half an hour. The officials at the Tent\\n    of Meeting tabulated the twelve tribal reports. Moses and his staff\\n    determined the training activities for the day. The trumpets sounded a\\n    second time and the available men, usually over 600,000, did as the trumpet\\n    calls directed. Most likely, they assembled in front of their tribe, in the\\n    space between the Levites and the general body of people. There they\\n    carried out the orders of the day.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    God began this consciousness of being a nation with His original call to\\n    Abraham when He told him he would become a nation. God repeated this idea\\n    to Isaac and again to Jacob: “Do not be afraid to go down to Egypt, for\\n    there I will make you into a great nation” (Genesis 46:3). Genesis 46:8\\n    says “Now these are the names of the descendants of Israel, who came into\\n    Egypt…” and then names those descendants. Jacob’s sons became the tribes of\\n    Israel. The clans and households of Israel arose from their descendants.\\n</p>\\n<h4>\\n    Difficulties in Following Genealogical Lists\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\n    Untangling Hebrew genealogies is challenging. The challenge begins with the\\n    person’s name. Generally, just one name is given for a particular Hebrew in\\n    any given passage. Imagine how difficult it would be to keep people\\n    straight if everyone was “David” or “Mary” or “Bill” in today’s society.\\n    One helpful device was naming certain people along with their father’s name\\n    (“Joshua the son of Nun;” “Caleb the son of Jephthunnah”). Some names were\\n    quite popular even then so various people answered to the same name. In\\n    fact, more than one person answered to many of the names found in the Old\\n    Testament and in one case twenty-three people found in Scripture bore the\\n    same name. Families gave their sons the name of a beloved grandfather or\\n    famous person. Abraham’s grandfather and brother both bear the name\\n    “Nahor.” Sometimes people were named after places special to families.\\n    Terah named Abraham’s oldest brother, Haran, after the city by that name.\\n    To further complicate matters, some Hebrews were known by several names, so\\n    various authors used different names for the same person. Relational words\\n    such as “son” could refer to an immediate descendant or a more distant one.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Perhaps writing material was scarce or expensive, so Hebrew authors\\n    practiced brevity and efficiency in listing descendants. Because relational\\n    words (father, son, daughter, brother, sister) could be used narrowly or\\n    broadly, when we read “son of,” for instance, it is often impossible to\\n    know if a particular list is condensed or complete. Thus, one cannot assume\\n    that the same name in two different places is the same individual or that a\\n    list of names is always inclusive. This is the most difficult challenge in\\n    sorting out Hebrew genealogies and the one that has led to the most\\n    distorted notions that claim to be based on the Word of God. This book\\n    would not be written if well-meaning, inerrancy-believing rank-and-file\\n    Christians had discerned that Hebrew genealogies were more often\\n    abbreviated than not.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Having seen how, on the one hand, genealogies provided identification, but\\n    on the other hand are difficult to sort out, we will now turn to their use.\\n    First, we will look at the use of basic relational terms—father, son, etc.\\n    Immediately we are in for a shock until we learn to think the way Hebrews\\n    used those words. In a moment, you will read that there was no word for\\n    “grandson” so the single word “son” covered all possibilities. Since our\\n    first reaction will be skepticism, we must offer numerous examples. Then we\\n    will proceed to more difficult (and more unbelievable) ways Hebrews\\n    rendered lists of their descendants. For instance, the total number of\\n    those going down to Egypt with Jacob includes unborn sons on the one hand\\n    and omits most of the daughters on the other hand, even though we read,\\n    “All the persons belonging to Jacob who came into Egypt, who were his own\\n    descendants, not including Jacob’s sons’ wives were sixty-six persons in\\n    all” (Genesis 46:26).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Building on this foundation, we take up case after case of abbreviated\\n    genealogies in chapter six. Won’t two or three examples do? Few are\\n    iron-clad. While this author has rendered his best judgment, some examples\\n    may be legitimately questioned. But with a preponderance of examples, the\\n    case becomes overwhelming.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The light is coming. We have been encouraged by recently printed statements\\n    in standard young earth creation periodicals like “OK, maybe Israel was in\\n    Egypt 430-years, not 215,” and “yes, perhaps, on occasion, Hebrew\\n    genealogies are abbreviated, but the Genesis 11 genealogy is\\n    comprehensive.” The thinking of young earth creationists is going in the\\n    right direction. But we believe ample evidence exists that Genesis 11,\\n    along with many other Hebrew genealogies, is condensed. Finally, with great\\n    reverence, we must realize that our Savior’s genealogy is a Hebrew\\n    genealogy and it, too, is a matter of identity, not completeness.\\n</p>\\n<h4>\\n    Simple Hebrew Vocabulary\\n</h4>\\n<p>\\n    Biblical Hebrew had no words for relationships like grandfather, grandson,\\n    uncle, cousin, etc. The standard relationship words were words like father,\\n    mother, son, daughter, brother and sister. So, when the word father was\\n    used, it might mean immediate father, but it also might mean grandfather or\\n    more distant ancestor. In the same way when the word son was used, it might\\n    mean immediate son, grandson or more remote descendant. The women said,\\n    “Naomi has a son,” when in fact Ruth’s baby was Naomi’s grandson (Ruth\\n    4:17). The first verse of the New Testament says “Jesus, son of David, son\\n    of Abraham,” when later verses show that Jesus lived many generations after\\n    David and David lived many generations after Abraham.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The verb “to bear/to beget” (Hebrew-YLD) was used in the same general way.\\n    The one born might be the immediate offspring or a more distant offspring\\n    or all descendants of an individual (sons of Israel). In response to our\\n    email question, “I can only find four Old Testament examples of YLD [“to\\n    beget/to bear”] referring to offspring more distant than son or daughter.\\n    How can I be sure?” Arie Uittenbogaard of Abarim Publications replied,\\n    “Common knowledge. In Hebrew father- and motherhood extend beyond the\\nprimary biological generation.”    <a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\" title=\"\">[1]</a>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    In effect this man was saying that examples are unnecessary. Among users of\\n    Hebrew, it is common knowledge that the verb “to bear/to beget” can be used\\n    for both immediate and later generations. As previously stated, the Hebrew\\n    concept is that all future generations are in the loins of the present\\n    generation and therefore the present generation produces all future\\n    generations. Thus, the Hebrews used these basic relational terms in both\\n    narrow and broad senses while more specific relationship terms are used\\n    most other languages.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Flexible/elastic. A Hebrew genealogy could (and often did) contain both\\n    immediate descendants and more distant descendants without any indication\\n    that some intermediate generations were omitted. We can conclude this\\n    because of what we have already seen as well as what we are about to see\\n    again and again. Our original example was that of Kohath-Amram-Aaron which\\n    reads like they were immediate father-son relationships. While Amram was\\n    the immediate son of Kohath, a number of unnamed sons stood between Amram\\n    and Aaron.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Moses wrote his older brother’s genealogy in Exodus six. He knew who their\\n    parents were and most likely every forefather back to Levi. But he did not\\n    name them all. There was no need. An abbreviated list adequately showed\\n    Aaron’s roots and thus where he belonged in the organization of Israel. So,\\n    Moses named their forefather who was a grandson of Levi and their\\n    foremother who was a daughter of Levi. Amram and Jochebed were highly\\n    visible ancestors among Jacob’s descendants. That connection made Moses and\\n    Aaron legitimate descendants of noted stock in Israel. Their lineage was\\n    beyond any challenge.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    No one disputes that relational words are used in the Bible in a general\\n    sense such as “the sons of Israel” where all the descendants of Jacob are\\n    called “sons.” But it is less well known that they are also used widely in\\n    a broad sense when individuals are spoken of. Such misunderstanding leads\\n    to grave misinterpretations of Scripture. Thus, there is a great need to\\n    see numerous examples of this use of relational words.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The following section provides such examples. While those familiar with the\\n    Bible will immediately understand many of the examples, explanation is\\n    given so that all may understand. First a simple example is given of each\\n    relational category used in a broad sense; then more complex examples are\\n    provided. Further insights will be developed as examples are explored.\\n</p>\\n<h3>\\n    Example of Each Kinship Term Used in a Broad Sense\\n</h3>\\n<p>\\n    <strong><u>To Beget/To Bear</u></strong>\\n    <strong>.</strong>\\nUse of the Hebrew verb <em>beget/bear</em> (YLD) in a broad sense:    <strong></strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <sup>58</sup>\\n    Kohath was the father of Amram. <sup>59</sup>Jochebed <u>bore</u> to Amram\\n    Aaron and Moses and Miriam. Numbers 26:58-59. (Underlining identifies the\\n    Hebrew verb YLD.)\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Kohath was the immediate father of Amram. But the three children Jochebed\\n    bore to Amram were actually their descendants about eight to twelve\\n    generations later. The Hebrew concept was that all descendants were in the\\n    loins of their forefathers. Statements of specific acts such as “to\\n    begat/to bear” were used accurately and literally to describe such distant\\n    relationships.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong><u>Father</u></strong>\\n    used for both a father and grandfather in the same verse:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    And David said to him, “Do not fear, for I will show you [Mephibosheth]\\n    kindness for the sake of your father Jonathan, and I will restore to you\\n    all the land of Saul your father, and you shall eat at my table always.” II\\n    Samuel 9:7.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Mephibosheth was the son of David’s dear friend Jonathan and the grandson\\n    of Saul, the first king of Israel. Yet David calls both men Mephibosheth’s\\n    father, showing how Hebrews easily used the term “father” for immediate and\\n    more distant direct ancestors.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong><u>Mother.</u></strong>\\n    Use of the concept of <em>mother</em> in a broad sense:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>\\n        He [Asa] also removed Maacah his mother from being queen mother…. I\\n        Kings 15:13.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Maacah was the mother of King Asa’s father and the grandmother of King Asa.\\n    However, of all the filial terms, this term is seldom used broadly.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong><u>Son</u></strong>\\n    . Use of the noun <em>son</em> in a broad sense:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    [Jacob asked,] “Do you know Laban, son of Nahor?” Genesis 29:5.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Jacob speaks of Laban as the son of Nahor. Actually, Laban was the son of\\n    Bethuel but grandson of Nahor. Most likely Jacob mentioned Nahor rather\\n    than Bethuel because Nahor was the forefather of many people in the area\\n    and would be well known. In case the shepherds did not know Laban, they\\n    could at least point Jacob in the right direction to where Nahor’s people\\n    lived.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong><u>Daughter</u></strong>\\n    <strong>.</strong>\\n    Use of the noun <em>daughter</em> in a broad sense:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    But Naomi said, “Turn back my daughters, why will you go with me?” Ruth\\n    1:11.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Naomi was speaking to her two daughters-in-law. They were not her children.\\n    This is the use of daughter in a wider sense than being the mother of these\\n    two women.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong><u>Brother/Sister</u></strong>\\n    . Use of the nouns <em>brother</em> and <em>sister</em> in a broad sense:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Say to your brothers, ‘You are my people,’ and to your sisters, ‘You have\\n    received mercy.’” Hosea 2:1.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    In the anticipation of fulfilled prophecy, Hosea foresaw that the people\\n    would call the men of the nation <em>brothers</em> and the women of the\\nnation <em>sisters</em>. This is the same type of broad sense of    <em>sister</em> as is found in Sons of Israel using <em>son</em> in a broad\\n    sense.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The above verses illustrate seven relational concepts used in a broad sense\\nin biblical Hebrew—<em>to beget/to bear, father, mother, son, daughter, brother</em> and    <em>sister</em>. Next we will examine more complex examples of the broad\\n    use of these relational words.\\n</p>\\n<h3>\\n    Examples with More Complexity\\n</h3>\\n<p>\\n    <strong><u>To Beget/To Bear</u></strong>\\n    used for child and multiple grandchildren together with a single use of the\\n    Hebrew verb <em>to beget/to bear</em> (YLD).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <sup>17</sup>\\nThe sons of Asher: Imnah, Ishvah, Ishvi, Beriah, with Serah their sister.    <sup>18</sup>These are the sons of Zilpah, …and these she bore to Jacob.\\n    Genesis 46:17-18.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The list of Jacob’s family going down to Egypt is arranged according to his\\n    four wives. Asher was a son of Jacob sired through Zilpah, Leah’s handmaid.\\n    The list names four sons and a daughter for Asher but then summarizes by\\n    saying Zilpah bore these children to Jacob when actually the only child\\n    born by Zilpah in this list was Asher. The passage also calls all five\\n    grandchildren sons when one was a granddaughter. While most languages would\\n    require such wording as “These are grandsons, granddaughter and son of\\n    Zilpah,” Hebrew is more flexible.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The idea of bearing a child who is actually a grandchild or more distant\\n    descendant is foreign to western thinking and therefore shocking to modern\\n    readers. Our first such example was that of Amram and Jochebed begetting\\n    Miriam, Aaron and Moses. Here is a second instance of bearing referring to\\n    someone other than an immediate offspring.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    While this broad use of the concept of “to bear, to beget” is unfamiliar to\\n    most, Hebrew language scholars such as noted scholar and commentator C.F.\\n    Keil acknowledged it many years ago. He wrote of the high priestly line of\\n    Aaron, “[YLD, the Hebrew word for “beget/bear] in the genealogical lists\\n    may express mediate procreation, and the grandson may be introduced as\\nbegotten by the grandfather.”    <a href=\"#_ftn2\" name=\"_ftnref2\" title=\"\">[2]</a> Keil is using the word\\n    “mediate” in contrast to “immediate” such as “the immediate offspring of.”\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong><u>To Beget/To Bear</u></strong>\\n    -other examples: Deuteronomy 4:25 and Isaiah 39:7 quoted in II Kings 20:18\\n    (speaks of sons born to Hezekiah but these sons were born generations\\n    later, not the immediate sons born to him or even his grandsons or great\\n    grandsons).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong><u>Father.</u></strong>\\n    Use of the noun <em>father</em> in a broad sense:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    You shall…[say], “A wandering Aramean was my father. And he went down into\\n    Egypt and sojourned there, few in number, and there he became a nation,\\n    great, mighty, and populous.” Deuteronomy 26:5.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Moses was speaking of Jacob when he told the 2.5 million people who lived\\n    half a millennium after Jacob to say “A wandering Aramean was my father.”\\n    He was teaching the Israelites to be humble about their roots, that it was\\n    God and not their forefather who was the source of all their blessings,\\n    making them a nation and giving them the Promised Land. In the broad sense\\n    of the word “father,” every descendant of Jacob could call him “father.”\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    How did this happen? At the age of 74 Jacob left his home in Canaan with\\n    just a staff and journeyed some 500 miles north to live with his uncle\\n    Laban in the land of Aram. Twenty years later he made his way back to\\n    Canaan with four wives and twelve named children. He lived in various\\n    places until finally at the age of 130 he moved down to Egypt just 70 in\\n    number. Yet his descendants left Egypt over four centuries later as a great\\n    nation.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong><u>Father</u></strong>\\n    used for the ancestor of various later descendants:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong><sup>3</sup></strong>\\n    <strong>\\n        The LORD was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the earlier ways of\\n        his <u>father</u> David; <sup>2</sup>[Hezekiah] did what was right in\\n        the eyes of the LORD, according to all that David his <u>father</u> had\\n        done; <sup>7</sup>Do not be like your <u>fathers</u>…. <sup>8</sup>Do\\n        not now be stiff-necked as your <u>fathers</u> were…. II Chron. 17:3;\\n        29:2; 30:7-8. (Underlining ours.)\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    David was the forefather of kings Jehoshaphat and Hezekiah who lived many\\n    generations later. Nevertheless, David is called their father. King\\n    Hezekiah urged his subjects to turn from the wicked deeds of their fathers\\n    which included generations of departure from the feasts prescribed in the\\n    Law of Moses. Four times the term “father” refers either in part or\\n    entirely to those who were separated by at least one generation from their\\n    immediate father.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong><u>Father</u></strong>\\n    referring to the original patriarchs of the Jewish people:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    See, I have set the land before you. Go in and take possession of the land\\n    that the LORD swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to\\n    give to them and to their offspring after them. Deuteronomy 1:8.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Be strong and courageous, for you shall cause this people to inherit the\\n    land that I swore to their fathers to give them. Joshua 1:6.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <sup>2</sup>\\n    Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, “Long ago, your fathers lived beyond\\n    the Euphrates, Terah, the father of Abraham and of Nahor, and they served\\n    other gods. <sup>3</sup>Then I took your father Abraham from beyond the\\n    River….” <sup>14</sup>Put away the gods your fathers served…, <sup>15</sup>\\n    Choose this day whom you will serve, whether the gods your fathers served\\n    in the region beyond the River…. Joshua 24:2-3, 14-15.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    In each of these three examples the people being spoken to are the\\n    generation that occupied the Promised Land. They are reminded that God had\\n    promised the land to the Patriarchs of Israel—Abraham, Isaac and Jacob who\\n    lived 500-600 years before—and their descendants. These Patriarchs are\\n    called the peoples’ fathers. In the strict sense, a person can have only\\n    one father. Yet here even Abraham’s idolatrous father Terah is called their\\n    father. Clearly “father” is used in the broad sense here. As in the case of\\n    “son” referring to the entire nation, no one questions this use of “father”\\n    as it occurs so frequently. Why then should it be surprising that “father”\\n    when applied to a single “son” could also be used in a broad sense?\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong><u>Father</u></strong>\\n    used in a broad sense even for non-Jewish peoples:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>\\n    <strong>\\n        King Belshazzar…. <sup>2</sup>Nebuchadnezzar his father…. Daniel 5:1-2.\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Belshazzar was actually the son or son-in-law of Nabonidus who was the son\\n    of Nebuchadnezzar. Critics have used this verse to claim the Bible is in\\n    error. But obviously Daniel was using “father” in the typical Hebrew broad\\n    sense. Inerrancy-minded Christians are not the only ones who have not\\n    understood the Hebrew practice of using filial terms in a broad sense.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong><u>Father</u></strong>\\n    -further examples of the broad use: Genesis 31:3; Deuteronomy 1:8; II Kings\\n    18:3; 22:4; I Chronicles 24:19; II Chronicles 28:27, 29:2, 34:3; Nehemiah\\n    2:8.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong><u>Son</u></strong>\\n    used for both an immediate son and a distant male descendant:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    And Shebuel the son of Gershom, son of Moses, was chief officer in charge\\n    of the treasuries. I Chronicles 26:24.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    While Gershom truly was the son of Moses, born about 1450 BC, Shebuel,\\n    treasury official of David, was born over 400 years later yet is said to be\\n    the son of Gershom.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong><u>Son</u></strong>\\n    used for various generations after the father without distinction:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The sons of Judah: Perez, Hezron, Carmi, Hur and Shobal. I Chron. 4:1.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <a name=\"__DdeLink__6405_1562312202\"></a>\\n    In this verse all five individuals are said to be sons of Judah, yet only\\n    one, Perez, was the immediate offspring of Judah. Hezron was a son of Perez\\n    and therefore a grandson of Judah. Perez’s twin brother, Zerah, had a\\n    distant descendant name Carmi, the father of Achan who troubled Israel in\\n    the time of Joshua. Hur and Shobal were sons of Hezron and thus great\\n    grandsons of Judah. Yet all are listed as sons of Judah. Clearly, the term\\n    “son” was very flexible in Hebrew genealogies.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong><u>Son</u></strong>\\n    used for a specific distant descendant:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    And the priest, the son of Aaron, shall be with the Levites when the\\n    Levites receive the tithes. Nehemiah 10:38.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The priesthood in Israel came from just one of the many families of the\\n    tribe of Levi, the family of Aaron. Aaron, the founder of this family,\\n    lived around 1500 BC. This example comes from the time of Nehemiah, about\\n    500 BC where the priest is called “the son of Aaron.” Obviously, the priest\\n    was a distant descendant of Aaron. The term “son” does not convey an\\n    immediate father-son relationship in Nehemiah 10:38.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong><u>Son</u></strong>\\n    used in the broad sense of a distant descendant of a clan leader:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    And Joshua and all Israel with him took <u>Achan the son of Zerah</u>, and\\n    the silver and the cloak and the bar of gold…. Joshua 7:24. (Underlining\\n    ours.)\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    When Israel defeated Jericho, a soldier named Achan from the tribe of Judah\\n    took booty God marked for destruction. In judgment Israel lost its next\\n    battle. “Joshua tore his clothes and fell to the earth on his face before\\n    the ark of the LORD until the evening, he and the elders of Israel” (Joshua\\n    7:6). God said Israel had sinned; they had transgressed His covenant. The\\n    guilty party was to be found and executed. God gave three levels of search:\\n    tribe, clan and household. In the morning each tribe was to be presented.\\n    The tribe that was taken would come by clan. The clan that was taken would\\n    come by household. The household that was taken would come by individual\\n    soldier (Joshua 7:14-ESV).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Joshua did as God commanded. When the tribes passed, Judah was taken. When\\n    the four clans of Judah passed, the clan of Zerah was taken. When the\\n    households of that clan passed, the household of Zabdi was taken.\\n    Eventually the soldier named Achan was taken. He confessed and was\\n    executed. Altogether the clans of Judah numbered 76,500 soldiers according\\n    to Numbers 26:22. Yet the passage calls Achan the son of Zerah even though\\n    he was just one of thousands of soldiers in that clan. The writer knew\\n    this. He did not make a mistake. He clearly gave the basic descent of\\n    Achan, beginning with his tribe, clan, and household as was the custom\\n    before skipping down to his father and him saying, “Achan, the son of\\n    Carmi, the son of Zabdi, son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken”\\n    (Joshua 7:18).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong><u>Son</u></strong>\\n    -other examples of the broad use: Exodus 12:35, 37 (“son” translated\\n    “people”); Numbers 26:5-40, 32:40, 41; Joshua 5:3, 17:6; II Samuel 9:9-10\\n    (twice); I Chronicles 6:44, 50; II Chronicles 29:12-14, 29:21, 31:19,\\n    35:14-15-3x; Ezra 2:1-14, 3:10; Nehemiah 10:39; 11:4-9, 22-24; 12:23, 47.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong><u>Daughter</u></strong>\\n    <strong>.</strong>\\n    Use of the noun <em>daughter</em> in a broad sense:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    None of the daughters of Israel shall be a cult prostitute.

Moses\\n    inquired of the LORD and was told to establish a law to the effect that if\\n    a family only had daughters, for the sake of the man’s name, his\\n    inheritance would go his daughters.

All his offspring he brought with him into Egypt.    <sup> 8</sup>Now these are the names of the descendants of Israel, who came\\n    into Egypt…. <sup>12</sup>The sons of Judah: Er, Onan, Shelah, Perez, and\\n    Zerah (but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan); and the sons of Perez\\n    were Hezron and Hamul. <sup>21</sup>And the sons of Benjamin: Bela, Becher,\\n    Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppin, Huppin, and Ard. <sup>26</sup>All\\n    the persons belonging to Jacob who came into Egypt, who were his own\\n    descendants, not including Jacob’s sons’ wives, were sixty-six persons in\\n    all. Genesis 46:5-8, 12, 21, 26.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Genesis 46:7 states that Jacob “brought all his offspring with him into\\n    Egypt.” Each offspring is named and counted. Yet some were not yet born.\\n    These unborn offspring could have been born up to 40 years after the move.\\n    They were grandsons and possibly even great grandsons. The list includes\\n    not only Perez but his two sons—Hezron and Hamul (Genesis 46:20). Since\\n    Perez himself was just born or maybe not yet quite born when they moved,\\n    his two sons would not be born until Jacob’s family had been living in\\n    Egypt 20-30 years. We might think the writer was deceptive to include\\n    unborn children in the list, but that is because we are judging by the way\\n    we look at genealogies. What was important to God was to establish the\\n    forefathers of the sons of Israel in the minds of the Jewish people.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Benjamin was born after Simeon and Levi massacred the men of Shechem. God\\n    told Jacob to move his family to Bethel. From there they moved to Isaac at\\n    Mamre (Hebron) and along the way, near Bethlehem, Rachel died giving birth\\n    to Benjamin. Twenty-four years later Jacob moved his family to Egypt, and\\n    in the Genesis 46:21 list of those who moved to Egypt are ten sons for\\n    Benjamin. While some may have been a scribal error, the rest most likely\\n    were still in the loins of their father. We must conclude that some were\\n    Benjamin’s grandsons, even though they are found in that list of Jacob’s\\n    offspring that he took to Egypt.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Naming and counting unborn children seems strange to us until we realize\\n    that the primary purpose of the genealogies was to bind a nation together\\n    by blood. Genealogies identified the members of the nation and gave them a\\n    powerful glue that is the marvel of the world to this day. No other nation\\n    ceased to exist for two millennia and then came back to life as Israel did\\n    in 1948. Naming both born and unborn descendants provided a registry from\\n    which the clans of Israel developed. Apparently, it was important to have a\\n    foundation of names in the registry from the beginning of the sojourn in\\n    Egypt. Only God could devise a system that would last nearly four\\n    millennia.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong><u>Undercounting of daughters</u></strong>\\n    :\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The passage says Jacob took “his daughters” to Egypt. Yet only one\\n    immediate daughter, Dinah, is listed and counted in the offspring total of\\n    66. On the other hand, neither Jacob’s four wives nor any of his sons’\\n    wives and only one granddaughter are counted in the family total of 70 that\\n    ended up in Egypt. Stephen has been faulted for saying that “Joseph sent\\n    and summoned Jacob his father and all his kindred, seventy-five persons in\\n    all” (Acts 7:14). Since the party included his four wives, his unnamed\\n    daughters and his sons’ unnamed daughters, who is to condemn some Rabbi\\n    whose Bible study Stephen attended who counted Jacob’s party using\\n    different criteria and found the total to be 75, not the 66 number of\\n    Genesis 46:26?\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>\\n        <u>Ancestors participating in the actions of descendants:</u>\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>\\n    <strong>\\n        So the field of Ephron in Machpelah, which was to the east of Mamre,\\n        the field with the cave…was made over <sup>18</sup>to Abraham as a\\n        possession in the presence of the Hittites...

Stephen’s words in Acts 7:16 appears to be\\n    a direct contradiction of these facts except for the Hebrew practice of\\n    associating ancestors with the actions of their descendants. In effect,\\nthrough Jacob Abraham purchased the Shechem property.    <a href=\"#_ftn3\" name=\"_ftnref3\" title=\"\">[3]</a>\\n</p>\\n<h3>\\n    Complete Genealogies\\n</h3>\\n<p>\\n    Before examining many abbreviated or condensed genealogies, let’s examine\\n    two apparently complete genealogies. From the tribe of Judah is Jerahmeel’s\\n    list of twenty-three generations beginning with Perez and ending sometime\\n    in the Period of the Judges. Judah raised two successive families. The\\n    second was by his Canaanite daughter-in-law Tamar who bore him the twins,\\n    Zerah and Perez. The only noted descendant of Zerah was Achan, the trouble\\n    maker of Israel. But many famous descendants came from the other twin,\\n    Perez, including King David, Caleb the believing spy, Bezelel who was the\\n    chief artisan on the Tabernacle and the Lord Jesus Christ. Perez also had\\n    two sons, Hezron and Hamul. The famous people mentioned above all came\\n    through Hezron who fathered three sons: Jerahmeel, Ram and Chelubai\\n    (Caleb). Jerahmeel’s list records 23 consecutive generations extending from\\n    the beginning of the Egyptian sojourn until about 200 years before David.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong><u>Complete genealogy of Jerahmeel</u></strong>\\n    <strong> </strong>\\n    (23 consecutive generations-numbering in brackets):\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <sup>25</sup>\\n[Perez-1; Hezron-2] The sons of Jerahmeel [3], the firstborn of Hezron….    <sup>26</sup>Jerameel also had another wife, whose name was Atarah; she was\\n    the mother of Onam [4]. <sup>28</sup>The sons of Onam: Shammai [5] and\\n    Jada. The sons of Shammai: Nadab [6] and Abishur. <sup>30</sup>The sons of\\n    Nadab: Seled and Appaim [7]. <sup>31</sup>The son of Appaim: Ishi [8]. The\\n    son of Ishi: Sheshan [9]. The son of Sheshan: Ahlai [10-actually Ahlai is\\n    Sheshan’s daughter]. <sup>34</sup>Now Sheshan had no sons, only daughters,\\n    but Sheshan had an Egyptian slave whose name was Jarha. <sup>35</sup>So\\n    Sheshan gave his daughter in marriage to Jarha his slave, and she bore him\\n    Attai [11]. <sup>36</sup>Attai fathered Nathan [12], and Nathan fathered\\n    Zabad [13]. <sup>37</sup>Zabad fathered Ephlal [14], and Ephlal fathered\\n    Obed [15]. <sup>38</sup>Obed fathered Jehu [16], and Jehu fathered Azariah\\n    [17]. <sup>39</sup>Azariah fathered Helez [18], and Helez fathered Eleasah\\n    [19]. <sup>40</sup>Eleasah fathered Sismai [20], and Sismai fathered\\n    Shallum [21]. <sup>41</sup>Shallum fathered Jekamiah [22], and Jekamiah\\n    fathered Elishama [23]. I Chron. 2:25-26, 31, 34-37, 39-41.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Although Jerahmeel had no significant descendants, no less than seventeen\\n    verses of Scripture are devoted to them. Why? He was Hezron’s firstborn.\\n    Time and again the firstborn is featured in the Old Testament merely\\n    because he was the firstborn. Apparently be cause so many famous people\\n    came from Hezron, the historian felt obligated to give all the information\\n    he had on Hezron’s firstborn even though he had no famous descendants.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Jerahmeel’s longest string has 23 descendants, finally concluding well into\\n    the period of the Judges. By comparison, the line of Ram, Hezron’s second\\n    eldest, reaches all the way from Perez to King David with just ten names.\\n    Because Jerahmeel’s line ends somewhere in the middle of the Judges, about\\n    eight more names would need to be added to reach to David’s birth. Clearly,\\n    many individuals are left out in the Perez-Ram-David line which will be\\n    examined in the next chapter.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    About 40 names are found in Jerahmeel’s listing (I Chronicles 2:25-41).\\n    Because it takes some doing to separate out the 23 generations that appear\\n    to be continuous, the following commentary is provided. Jacob fathered\\n    Judah, his fourth son, who fathered Perez. Judah was about 45 years old\\n    when his father moved the family to Egypt (1876 BC). Perez could not have\\n    been born much before the time of this move (if he were even born before\\n    this move) since he and his twin brother Zerah were born after Judah had\\n    grown from birth in Haran to adulthood in Shechem, had fathered three sons\\n    who also grew to adulthood and two had died by the judgment of God, all in\\n    those 45 years. Thus, the birth of Tamar’s twins, Zerah and Perez, had to\\n    have occurred very close to that move to Egypt in 1876 BC and thus is a\\n    convenient way to count generations, not only the 23 of Jerahmeel’s line,\\n    but those leading to Caleb, David, Bezelel and Christ as well, all starting\\n    at 1876 BC. For convenience the 23 generations are listed below without\\n    verse notations:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    1-Perez; 2-Hezron; 3-Jerahmeel; 4-Onam; 5-Shammai; 6-Nadab; 7-Appaim;\\n    8-Ishi; 9-Sheshan who had no sons, only daughters, one of whom he gave to\\n    his Egyptian slave Jarha; 10-Ahlai, daughter of Sheshan first called his\\n    son then explained that she was really his daughter but that he had no\\n    sons; 11-Attai; 12-Nathan; 13-Zabad; 14-Ephlal; 15-Obed; 16-Jehu (whom we\\n    suggest was in the Exodus generation); 17-Azariah; 18-Helez; 19-Eleasah;\\n    20-Sismai; 21-Shallum; 22-Jekamiah; 23-Elishama. I Chronicles 2:25-41.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Most lists have difficulties and Jerahmeel’s is no exception. The greatest\\n    difficulty here is determining when it ends historically. Scripturally, the\\n    list ends with “and Jekamiah fathered Elishama” (I Chronicles 2:41) before\\n    moving on to “The sons of Caleb the younger brother of Jerahmeel…” in the\\n    next verse. Does this list extend through the Judges or even through the\\n    kings to the Captivity? The text doesn’t say.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    One observation is that the genealogies coming at the beginning of\\n    Chronicles seem to focus on Israel’s earlier history. The one strong clue\\n    is that the ninth name, Sheshan, had an Egyptian slave whom he gave to his\\n    daughter to carry on his name since he had no sons. When during the\\n    430-year Egyptian sojourn might the Israelites have been so prosperous and\\n    free as to own slaves who were Egyptian in nationality before the Hebrews\\n    themselves were reduced to slavery? It needed to be before they became so\\n    numerous as to be a threat to Egypt.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    During the years of famine Joseph managed the transfer of the land to\\n    Pharaoh, thereby greatly strengthening Pharaoh’s office. Pharaoh showed his\\n    gratitude by favoring Joseph and his family with some of Egypt’s best\\n    grazing land in the northeast of the Nile delta. Gradually Egypt declined\\n    and eventually the northern portion was overrun by the famous Hyksos\\n    people. They, like the Hebrews, were of Semitic stock. The Hyksos needed\\n    allies among the defeated Egyptians, so Israel most likely enjoyed a\\n    measure of freedom under them. Most likely it was during that period that\\n    Sheshan gave his daughter Ahlai, who is called “his son” in verse 31, to\\n    his Egyptian slave Jarha. This marriage occurs in the tenth generation of\\n    Perez through Jerahmeel. At this point in history we estimate that new\\n    generations were beginning about every 25 years so the daughter Ahlai would\\n    have been born about 250 years into the Egyptian sojourn or 180 years\\n    before the Exodus.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Sometime later stronger Pharaohs of the eighteenth dynasty arose who drove\\n    out the Hyksos. At that point the Hebrews would have been deemed a threat\\n    so they were put to servitude. Shortly thereafter Princess Hatshepsut,\\n    daughter of Thutmose I, found and adopted Moses. Hatshepsut went on to\\n    control or rule Egypt for nearly a quarter of a century, first on behalf of\\n    her sickly husband, Thutmose II, and then on behalf of his infant son,\\n    Thutmose III, by a court woman. Thutmose III is said to have been about\\n    twenty-two years old when he finally wrestled the throne from his\\n    step-mother. He proved to be a powerful Pharaoh who extended the rule of\\n    Egypt all the way to the Euphrates.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    At the age of 40 Moses had to flee when he killed the Egyptian because\\n    Thutmose III would use this crime as a way of removing his rival Moses. Dr.\\n    Merrill points out that this Pharaoh is the only one to rule Egypt for\\n    forty years until Ramses II who ruled 200 years later and therefore the\\n    only Pharaoh to fit the timeline of Moses during a considerable stretch of\\n    Egyptian history.<a href=\"#_ftn4\" name=\"_ftnref4\" title=\"\">[4]</a> God kept\\n    Moses in the wilderness forty years until the next pharaoh, Amenhotep II,\\n    succeeded Thutmose III.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Returning to our timeline, if Sheshan’s slave is correctly dated, the 15th\\n    or 16<sup>th</sup> generations of Jerahmeel would be the generation that\\n    left Egypt in the Exodus. That leaves the final seven or eight generations\\n    for the first half of the 480 period from the Exodus until Solomon’s\\n    Temple. Thus, Jarehmeel’s line falls about eight generations short of\\n    Solomon’s reign or seven of David’s. Dr. Keil generally supports this view,\\n    being of the opinion that Jerahmeel’s line ended somewhere near the end of\\n    the period of the Judges.<a href=\"#_ftn5\" name=\"_ftnref5\" title=\"\">[5]</a>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    In conclusion the line of Jerahmeel seems to indicate that about 30\\n    generations are involved in the time from the beginning of the Egyptian\\n    sojourn and the birth of Perez until the beginning of Solomon’s reign.\\n    These 30 generations cover a period of some 906 years (1876-970=906).\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong><u>Complete genealogy of Heman</u></strong>\\n    <strong> </strong>\\n    (19 consecutive generations-numbering in brackets):\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <sup>31</sup>\\n    These are the men whom David put in charge of the service of song in the\\n    house of the LORD after the ark rested there. <sup>33</sup>Of the sons of\\n    the Kohathites: Heman [1] the singer the son of Joel [2], son of Samuel\\n    [3], <sup>34</sup>son of Elkanah [4], son of Jeroham [5], son of Eliel [6],\\n    son of Toah [7], <sup>35</sup>son of Zuph [8], son of Elkanah [9], son of\\n    Mahath [10], son of Amasai [11], <sup>36</sup>son of Elkanah [12], son of\\n    Joel [13], son of Azariah [14], son of Zephaniah [15], <sup>37</sup>son of\\nTahath [16], son of Assir [17], son of Ebiasaph [18], son of Korah [19],    <sup>38</sup>son of Izhar, son of Kohath, son of Levi, son of Israel. I\\n    Chron. 6:31, 33-38.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Our second example of a complete genealogy provides what the first did\\n    not—a precise ending point as well as a precise starting point. When Jacob\\n    took his family to Egypt, his third son Levi came with his three sons\\n    Gershon, Kohath and Merari. Eventually they multiplied into a large tribe.\\n    Each of the sons formed a clan. God gave the clans of Levi to assist Aaron\\n    for the ministry of the Tabernacle. Seven hundred years later Samuel and\\n    even later David organized the Levites for ministry. After bringing the Ark\\n    to Jerusalem David appointed one person from each clan to be a worship\\n    leader at the Tabernacle. In the center Heman was to lead the Kohathite\\n    singers. On his right Asaph would lead the Gershonite singers. On his left\\n    hand Ethan was to direct the Merari singers.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    To have had this heavy responsibility Heman needed to be a mature man at\\n    the time of his appointment. In fact, his own family all but filled the\\n    choir loft. I Chronicles 25:5 reports that God gave Heman fourteen sons and\\n    three daughters who were all under the direction of their father’s musical\\n    work in the house of the LORD. Yet he not only served in David’s day but\\n    lived to serve in Solomon’s day as well. David brought the Ark to Jerusalem\\n    after his first seven years of rule in Hebron which began about 1010 BC. So\\n    Heman was maybe slightly older than David; 1000 BC is certainly a ballpark\\n    ending point for Heman’s genealogy. But where did it begin? Actually it\\n    began with Jacob but what grabs our attention is the name Korah. Korah was\\n    the leader of the rebellion against the leadership of Moses and Aaron and\\n    becomes the reason the story of Heman is so touching.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The story begins shortly after that first year of law-giving in the\\n    wilderness so it could be dated to about 1444 BC. God strongly guarded both\\n    the spiritual things of Israel under Aaron and the civil authority under\\n    Moses. The severity of punishment for violating those institutions is well\\n    known. A well-meaning man steadied the Ark during transport and God struck\\n    him dead. Anyone without authorization within the tabernacle grounds was to\\n    be put to death. Levites of the clan of Kohath and sons of Reuben found 250\\n    princes of Israel to join them to challenge the authority of Moses and\\n    Aaron and God struck them all dead (Numbers 16). The camp took the side of\\n    those slain so God sent a plague that consumed thousands. Only the\\n    intercession of Moses and Aaron stopped the plague. Eighteen generations\\n    later a descendant of this wicked man Korah became worship leader of the\\n    entire nation. What a story of mercy and grace.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The dates are known: the rebellion of Korah about 1444 BC and the Ark\\n    carried to Jerusalem about 1000 BC, a time span of nearly 450 years. The\\n    number of generations identified in the Heman list for this period is 19.\\n    But Aaron and Korah were in their 80’s while David and Heman were in their\\n    40’s, so one generation must be subtracted from Heman’s list. That leaves\\n    18 names. In counting the time from one generation to the next, begin\\n    counting with the second person. That leaves 17 names or 26.5 years per\\n    generation which is well in the ballpark for generations.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Now we must return to David’s list which will be discussed in chapter\\n    seven. It is found four times in the Bible, beginning with Ruth 4:18-22.\\n    That list gives ten names starting with the move to Egypt in 1876 BC. The\\n    first three names are those who lived at the beginning of the 430-years in\\n    Egypt-Perez, Hezron and Ram. Then it skips down 300 years to the time of\\n    the Exodus with three more names: Amminadab, Nahshon and Salmon. Amminadab\\n    was the elderly patriarch of Judah. His son, Nahshon was the Prince of\\n    Judah whom Moses asked to conduct the second census for Judah. Salmon\\n    married Rahab after the fall of Jericho. From that point to David is 400\\n    years yet only four names remain in David’s genealogy—Boaz, Obed, Jesse and\\n    David. If there were no omitted generations, that list would represent 100\\n    years per generation. The Heman list not only shows us what a complete\\n    genealogy would look like from the Exodus to the time of worship in\\n    Jerusalem but it also shows that the David list is abbreviated.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Finally, the Heman list omits 8-12 generations during the Egyptian sojourn\\n    just like the Aaron list did. It begins with Jacob, then Levi, then Kohath,\\n    then Izhar, then Korah. Aaron’s list follows the same pattern:\\n    Jacob-Levi-Kohath-Amram-Aaron. The first three names in each list is the\\n    same. The difference comes with Kohath’s sons. Aaron descended from Amram,\\n    the first of Kohath’s sons while Korah descended from Izhar, the second of\\n    Kohath’s four sons. Kohath and his sons Amram and Izhar lived at the\\n    beginning of the sojourn in Egypt. Aaron and Korah were born 300 years\\n    later near the end of the Egyptian sojourn. The Heman list follows the\\n    pattern of and therefore confirms Aaron’s list by skipping 8-12 generations\\n    between Izhar and Korah just like the Aaron list skipped 8-12 generations\\n    between Amram and Aaron.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Heman’s list is ascending, moving back through time from son to father. We\\n    will reverse it to view it the usual way (descending from father to son).\\n    We have removed Heman’s three forefathers (Levi-Kohath-Izhar) which we\\n    spoke of above:\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    1-Korah; 2-Ebiasaph; 3-Assir; 4-Tahath; 5-Zephaniah; 6-Azariah; 7-Joel;\\n    8-Elkanah; 9-Amasai; 10-Mahath; 11-Elkanah; 12-Zuph; 13-Toah; 14-Eliel;\\n    15-Jeroham; 16-Elkanah; 17-Samuel; 18-Joel; 19-Heman.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Defenders of the 215-year view see such numbers and are forced to devise a\\n    scheme that harmonizes the numbers, oblivious to the nature and purpose of\\n    Hebrew genealogies. For example, one book says that Judah’s first two sons\\n    had children when they were 14 or 15 years old and Judah’s twins, Zerah and\\n    Perez, likewise had sons when they were still teenagers. Then to bridge the\\n    huge time span from that son to Bezalel, it suggests that each of the next\\n    fathers, Hezron, Caleb and Hur had their firstborns when they were in their\\n    sixties. Then to bridge the next brief time span, with a straight face this\\n    interpreter says the next generations had their sons when they were 20\\n    years old. The Korah-Heman list assures us that the Hebrew generations\\n    during those centuries were within the range of reason, in this case\\n    averaging 26 years per generation.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Along the line of developing a story to fit misinterpreted numbers, another\\n    writer explained how four generations produced the six hundred thousand men\\n    found in the first census after the Exodus. The writer said it was simple.\\n    Each father had many sons, an average of like six sons per father per\\n    generation. In contrast with this speculation the record tells a different\\n    story. For every male that had six or more sons there was one that died\\n    early or didn’t even marry or didn’t have children or had just one or two\\n    sons.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    The other two lines of temple musicians are listed in I Chronicles 6 as\\n    well. However, they do not provide the same measure of certainty as the\\n    line of Heman. His line parallels Aaron’s line for both his and Aaron’s\\n    line give the first three generations living in Egypt, then skip down to\\n    the individual in their line who was an older adult at the time of the\\n    Exodus—Aaron and Korah. But in the case of Asaph and Ethan, we cannot\\n    identify the individual in their line who was contemporary with Aaron and\\n    Korah and thus their lines have no clear starting point. Both Ethan’s and\\n    Asaph’s lines become suspect to abbreviation.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    <strong>\\n        <u>\\n            In summary this chapter uncovered the following characteristics of\\n            Hebrew lines:\\n        </u>\\n    </strong>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    1. The biblical genealogies are elegant, profound, mysterious, practical,\\n    personal and flexible in nature.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    2. Genealogies told the Hebrew who he was and where he belonged. They were\\n    a major element in organizing Israel both in the wilderness camp and in\\n    settling Canaan.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    3. The simplicity of Hebrew names requires great care in tracing lists. For\\n    the most part only a single name is given for an individual though several\\n    different names might be used for the same individual in different places.\\n    Some names were very popular so many people were known by the same name.\\n    People were given the names of famous ancestors. (In the English it is\\n    sometimes even hard to tell if a name is male or female.)\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    4. Biblical Hebrew contains only basic relational terms such as father,\\n    son, daughter, brother and beget. The same word could be used for immediate\\n    connections such as a father and his immediate son or more distant\\n    connections from ancestor to descendant or from descendant to ancestor.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    5. When the biblical text is read these elements appear in all their\\n    complexity. The company of people who moved to Egypt included the names of\\n    unborn sons. A daughter is even called a son. In the same verse a man is\\n    called the son of both his father and grandfather. I Chronicles 4:1 speaks\\n    of the sons of Judah then gives five names—one was a son, one was a\\n    grandson, two were great grandsons and one was a descendant who lived 400\\n    years later.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    6. Scripture provides two apparently complete and lengthy lists—those of\\n    Jerahmeel and Heman. When David’s list is compared with those lists, it is\\n    found to be greatly abbreviated. For instance, during the same time frame\\n    that Jerahmeel’s list contains twenty-three names and Heman’s list contains\\n    19 names, David’s list contains six names. These comparisons help us to see\\n    that David’s genealogy is greatly condensed. Our next chapter will present\\n    14 examples of abbreviated genealogies including several already\\n    introduced. The chapter after that will address the most contentious of all\\n    genealogies, that of Shem.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    7. All these examples were correct uses of the Hebrew in the day they were\\n    recorded. They all reflect the inerrancy and infallibility of Scripture.\\n    However, they require that the student of Scripture be sensitive to the\\n    language in which they were written and understand these lists in terms of\\n    the language of that day, not the language of our day.\\n    <br clear=\"all\"/>\\n</p>\\n<div>\\n    <br clear=\"all\"/>\\n    <hr align=\"left\" size=\"1\" width=\"33%\"/>\\n    <div id=\"ftn1\">\\n        <p>\\n            <a href=\"#_ftnref1\" name=\"_ftn1\" title=\"\">[1]</a>\\n            Abarim Publications online Biblical Hebrew Dictionary.
