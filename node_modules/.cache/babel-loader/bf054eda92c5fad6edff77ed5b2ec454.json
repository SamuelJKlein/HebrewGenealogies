Three</h2>\n\n<h1 >\n    Abraham's Witness to a 430-Year Egyptian Sojourn\n</h1>\n<p>\n    The previous chapter observed that of the four witnesses only the words of\n    the Apostle Paul in Galatians 3:17 can reasonably be made to support a\n    215-year Egyptian sojourn. For his words to have this meaning, God's call\n    had to come when Abraham was living in Haran, a position that is fatally\n    flawed. Such an idea comes both from misinterpreting the Scriptural record\n    of certain events and oversimplifying how God was preparing Abraham for a\n    life of faith. Yet the subject is complex and is not settled with a few\n    simple proof texts.\n</p>\n<p>\n    This chapter begins by noting the many contributions to Abraham's total\n    life story in those first 75 years overlooked by Ussher and his followers.\n    In the process most readers will gain an entirely new appreciation for this\n    one whom God used to found the Jewish people and birth our Savior. Those\n    years were not unlike the early years of Moses, Paul, Joseph and David\n    whose stops and starts laid groundworks for their future ministries.\n    Understanding these puts flesh on the bones of Abraham's life of growing\n    faith. Although sinning and doubting along the way, this man who worshipped\n    idols in Ur with his kindred, (Joshua 24:2) came to build altars to the one\n    and only true God in Haran so that when he arrived in Canaan his first\n    response was to build an altar (Genesis 12:7-8). How did that happen?\n</p>\n<p>\n    When the call came in Ur, even Abraham's idolatrous father must have been\n    awed by his son's claims that if he followed the true God's leading, God\n    would make of him a great nation and in him all the families of the earth\n    would be blessed (Genesis 12:2-3). Apparently once Terah realized that he\n    could not talk his son out of this insane plan to walk away from his life\n    in Ur, he began to wonder if maybe God did appear to him after all. Terah\n    had taken delight in his son's impressive achievements in Ur and had the\n    strongest confidence in this only son still in his household. In the end,\n    with his final years looming, his only option was to accompany his son\n    although some of this remains a mystery. We can only surmise but history\n    points to difficult times ahead for Ur. God often uses circumstances in His\n    leading. Perhaps in this case the winds of war were already in the air.\n    Whew, away from that!\n</p>\n<p>\n    Along the journey the family most likely questioned Abraham: what next? God\n    had said \"to go to the land that I will show you\" (Genesis 12:1). Hebrews\n    11:8 concurs:\n</p>\n<p>\n    <strong>\n        By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to a place that he\n        was to receive as an inheritance. And he went out, not knowing where he\n        was going.\n    </strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n    In a way not explained by Scripture God was showing Abraham where to go\n    just as He had said. At each fork somehow God led him. As they journeyed\n    from Ur Abraham confidently told his party whether to go left, right or\n    straight ahead. Because this went on for nearly two months Abraham's party\n    must have felt better and better about the move with each passing day. Then\n    suddenly about 700 miles from Ur Abraham didn't know which way to go.\n    Whatever method God used to lead him stopped, vanished, disappeared into\n    thin air. So there they waited and waited. Not a sign, not a hint from God.\n    Finally, after some days, heavy with disappointment, they began to discuss\n    what went wrong. Abraham knew-while he had separated from his country and\n    relatives, he had not separated from his father's idolatrous household. Now\n    what?\n</p>\n<p>\n    The decision was made to settle in Haran. Scripture doesn't tell how far\n    Haran was from where the leading stopped but it does report that \"when they\n    came to Haran, they settled there\" (Genesis 11:31) even though they\n    eventually learned that the destination was Canaan. After all this divine\n    leading and the visitation that triggered it, Abraham would never be the\n    same. Now he knew there was a great difference between the idolatrous gods\n    of Ur and the true God who spoke to him in Ur and led him as far as Haran.\n    He must know this true God. Information was available to those so motivated\n    and Abraham began to gather that information and seek this God. With the\n    passing of time he began to worship this true God. He began to build altars\n    as those before him who worshipped the true God had done.\n</p>\n<p>\n    For the next 10 or 15 years Abraham got to know the true God better and\n    better and worshiped at the altar more and more frequently. This in itself\n    is remarkable but another remarkable thing began to happen. The members of\n    Terah's household began joining Abraham at the altar. Eventually,\n    apparently Terah's entire household worshiped at the altar. He was in his\n    final days and now totally dependent on his son. Very possibly before the\n    end he also joined with the others at Abraham's altar. Oh, how marvelous\n    was the grace of God in allowing this family situation to play out in Haran\n    over those years.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The proof for all this is the large evidence of faith demonstrated by\n    Abraham's household once they reached Canaan-immediately worshipping at\n    altars upon arrival, ascribing faith to Lot (II Peter 2:7), choosing for\n    Hebron and the suicidal mission of rescuing Lot from the invasion of the\n    Mesopotamian armies.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <strong>Abraham's Place in the Birth Order of Terah's Sons</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n    Piecing together those 75 years before the move to Canaan requires solving\n    the issue of birth order of Terah's three sons. Stephen said that Abraham\n    moved to Canaan after Terah died (Acts 7:4). He died at the age of 205\n    (Genesis 11:32). Since Abraham arrived in Canaan at the age of 75 (Genesis\n    12:4), he was born when Terah was 130 years old (205-75=130). Because Terah\n    began fathering his three sons when he was 70, Abraham had a brother who\n    was 60 years his senior (130-70=60).\n</p>\n<p>\n    But Abraham is generally considered the oldest son. Twice Scripture names\n    Terah's three sons and in both cases the order is Abraham, Nahor and Haran\n    (Genesis 11:26, 27). People assume the sons are named in the order of their\n    birth. While this is the normal practice of Scripture, sometimes it names\n    sons in the order of their importance or impact in the plan of God. Such is\n    the case here. Abraham would touch the entire world. Nahor would supply\n    wives to Abraham's descendants. Haran died in relative obscurity. As to why\n    the three brothers were born over a period of 60 years, Terah apparently\n    had a fertility problem. This explanation seems reasonable because his\n    daughter Sarah was barren, his granddaughter Rebekah also was barren and\n    even his great-granddaughter Rachel was barren.\n</p>\n<p>\n    As to the ages of Abraham's two brothers, Nahor and Haran, Scripture\n    provides important hints to work with. First, Nahor married Haran's\n    daughter Milcah. Second, Haran's name suggests Terah enjoyed business\n    success at the trade route town by that name before moving to Ur. Third,\n    Haran died before Abraham left Ur. These three details point to Haran being\n    older than Nahor. When was Nahor born? He had eight sons by Haran's\n    daughter and was no longer living with his father when God called Abraham.\n    Further Abraham was attached to Lot, the son of Haran, not his brother\n    Nahor. These details indicate Nahor would have been 30 or 40 years older\n    than Abraham. Now a possible picture emerges: Haran was born when Terah was\n    70. Nahor was born 20-40 years later. Abraham was the youngest brother,\n    born 60 years after Haran.\n</p>\n<p>\n    More details emerge. Abraham married his father's daughter by a second\n    wife. Sarah was ten years younger than Abraham. They were married long\n    enough in Ur to discover that unlike her sister-in-law, she was barren.\n    This seems to indicate that Abraham lived many adult years in Ur. The age\n    for adulthood was 25 at the time. Possibly Abraham married Sarah once she\n    reached that age. Then, 25-30 years of marriage would be adequate to\n    realize that Sarah could not have children and would place the call of God\n    when Abraham was 60 or 65. If so, Haran died by the age of 130 or 135 and\n    Terah was 190 or 195. Living 35-40 adult years in Ur allowed Abraham to\n    learn and achieve much and drink deeply from Ur's culture while 10-15 years\n    of mature adult life in Haran would have been enough time to become wealthy\n    both materially and spiritually .\n</p>\n<p>\n    <strong>Nephew Older Than Uncle</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n    With Lot's father 60 years older than Abraham and Lot's sister marrying\n    Abraham's other brother, Lot himself must have been some years older than\n    Abraham. Does this fit the context? Actually, Lot being older than Abraham\n    makes better sense of what Scripture reveals of their relationship. One\n    gets the impression that Abraham was more attached to Lot than Lot was to\n    Abraham which would be expected if Lot were older than Abraham.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Abraham's real older brother, Nahor, was preoccupied with a growing family.\n    Meanwhile Lot continued to live in the household of his grandfather. So\n    Lot, not Nahor, became the \"big brother\" figure in Abraham's life. This\n    bonding would be a new explanation for why Abraham was so loyal to him and\n    would also explain why Abraham offered Lot first choice of the land when\n    they separated (Genesis 13). It would further explain how Lot could go his\n    separate way and seek out Sodom rather than staying close to Abraham. He\n    thought for himself. He had his own views. He did what he pleased. In\n    summary, if Lot were the elder, he would have been something of a big\n    brother in Abraham's childhood and this early relationship colored\n    Abraham's relationship with him in adulthood.\n</p>\n<p>\n    As to Terah, he was becoming infirm and dependent on others. His oldest son\n    was dead and the other was living on his own. Abraham was the only son left\n    to care for him when God's call came. As it played out, this youngest son\n    and his daughter cared for Terah until his death. These also became the\n    obvious heirs to Terah's household along with Lot who must have received an\n    inheritance in place of his father who was the oldest son. This would also\n    explain where Lot got the vast herds that forced him and Abraham to\n    separate shortly after arriving in Canaan.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <strong>Life in Ur</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n    Of all the cities on the face of the earth in which to live in Abraham's\n    day, Ur would have won top honors. It was the Paris of its time, even more\n    advanced than any city in Egypt, leading in wealth, education, security,\n    comfort and pleasure. Standing at the head of the Persian Gulf, it\n    controlled the mouth of the Euphrates. Thousands of tablets have been\n    recovered from the site that reflect this period. Numerous royal graves\n    were found unrobbed and filled with historical artifacts. The temple\n    complex housed a school. Sir Leonard Woolley excavated the levels of Ur\n    from 1922-1934 and learned from student work tablets the extensive\n    knowledge taught its youth, even high school level math. Consequently, the\n    free population was both intelligent and well educated. The monarchy and\n    the worship of the moon god were unifying institutions.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Archaeologists report that most of Ur's population consisted of\n    servants/slaves. If 90% were not completely free and the country's total\n    population numbered 250,000, then only 25,000 were actual citizens.\n    Abraham's kin could have numbered in the hundreds and wielded a significant\n    influence within the free population. About Abraham's time Ur had a\n    powerful and successful army. At one point it was the dominant force in\n    Mesopotamia, establishing hegemony all the way up the Euphrates to the\n    Mediterranean. Free citizens made up the higher echelons. If Abraham had\n    followed a military career, he would have studied military science and\n    worked up to a significant command position. Whether or not the military\n    was his career, his military savvy shines in the following event.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <strong>The Campaign of Four Mesopotamian Armies</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n    In an astonishing military victory Abraham defeated a coalition of four\n    Mesopotamian armies some nine years after he arrived in Canaan. After\n    serving the King of Elam 12 years the population center where Lot moved\n    rebelled. Scripture is clear about the military force that retaliated\n    (Genesis 14:1-16)-its size, objective and success. The king, Chedorlaomer,\n    brought his army from an area to the east of Lower Mesopotamia, today's\n    southwestern Iran. These people were later called Persians. After Abraham\n    followed God to Haran, Chedorlaomer's country defeated Ur and destroyed the\n    city. In short order Elam extended its governance all the way to the\n    Sodom-Gomorrah region. Now its present ruler came with three\n    allies-Amraphel king of Shinar (Babylon), Arioch king of Ellasar (Larsa,\n    longtime rival of Ur) and Tidal, king of Nations (apparently from Upper\n    Mesopotamia).\n</p>\n<p>\n    These four kings controlled an enormous area, from Upper Mesopotamia to\n    well beyond Lower Mesopotamia, 500 to 1500 miles distant from Sodom. One\n    commentator suggested this force could have numbered 100,000 soldiers.\n    Their columns stretched for miles. As they left the Euphrates and marched\n    southwest towards Sodom, raiders from the badlands to the east plundered\n    their columns and supply lines. Distracted from their original mission they\n    began fighting people group after people group to the east of their route\n    (Genesis 14:5-6). These actions eventually placed them to the south and\n    east of their goal.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Turning west they encountered and defeated the desert people that occupied\n    the lands south of Sodom. Finally they reached their objective, attacking\n    the Sodomites but in a surprise maneuver only hinted at in Scripture. The\n    defenders expected the enemy to approach from the south but seem to have\n    been pinned against the bitumen pits. This would point to an unexplained\n    backdoor route descending the hills to the west and only lightly guarded by\n    the defenders. In this battle the consortium utterly crushed the five kings\n    that governed the heavily populated Sodom-Gomorrah civilization bowl. With\n    no opposition remaining, the victors began the long march home loaded with\n    plunder and the population whom they would sell into slavery. Abraham's\n    \"big brother\" was headed for a miserable future.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <strong>Abraham's Private Army</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n    An escapee brought the bad news to Abraham who immediately gathered his\n    forces to free Lot. The odds at this point appeared to be 100 to 1. This\n    was certain suicide, unless Abraham was a military genius. Scripture\n    suggests as much, relating that Abraham \"led forth his trained men, born in\n    his house, 318 of them.\" (Genesis 14:14). Abraham had his own private army.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Until now Scripture had said nothing about Abraham training his servants\n    for combat. From what happens in the battle one must conclude that they had\n    military skills equal to the invaders who were professional soldiers,\n    battle hardened after an unexpectedly difficult possibly year-and-a-half\n    long campaign. With Abraham about 84 years old the youngest of his fighters\n    would have been born when Abraham was 64 years old or 11 years before he\n    left Haran for Canaan. The fact that they were born in his house indicates\n    he began their training at an early age and that this practice had been\n    going on for many years.\n</p>\n<p>\n    What did these trained fighters look like? As a general over his army\n    Abraham trained them to handle lethal weapons and kill. His forces knew how\n    to work together to overcome far superior forces. They were cunning, strong\n    and had tremendous endurance. Where could Abraham possibly have gained this\n    military knowledge? You guessed it-in Ur. During his early years in Ur its\n    army was having great success. Now he had an army like Ur's in his very own\n    household. His men could face the best from Mesopotamia. Would it be too\n    much to say Abraham's 318 were among the best soldiers alive in their day?\n</p>\n<p>\n    <strong>Abraham's Amorite Confederates</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n    Even more remarkable, Abraham had Amorite confederates who joined this\n    suicidal venture. Why? They had to have confidence in Abraham's knowledge\n    of warfare. This explains another mystery. Why would the Amorites share\n    their land with Abraham in the first place? Shortly after arriving in\n    Canaan the range land proved insufficient for Abraham's and Lot's cattle so\n    they separated. Lot set his tent towards Sodom while Abraham moved to\n    Hebron. What Scripture doesn't explain is that Hebron was the highest\n    ground in Israel, even higher than Jerusalem which is a half mile above sea\n    level. It was one of the most out of the way and defensible locations\n    Abraham could choose. Furthermore, it had limited access. It was at a dead\n    end. Abraham literally took the high ground. But it was occupied by\n    Amorites. So while this act displays great military savvy, how would the\n    Amorites ever be persuaded to share their land with him?\n</p>\n<p>\n    First, Abraham proved to be a diplomat and a business man. Somehow he\n    showed them that his presence would be to their advantage. Second, he must\n    have shared his military experiences from Ur. The Amorites had never heard\n    such things. They were impressed. His fighters and the Amorite fighters\n    would have contests. Abraham's were superior. Abraham began telling them\n    how he trained his fighters. They formed a mutual defense alliance. Over a\n    five or six year period the Amorites greatly increased their military\n    skills and came to have unflagging confidence in Abraham.\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n    <strong>A Military Victory for the Books</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n    Now Lot and his family were prisoners. Abraham loved his nephew and saw his\n    interest in the true God (\"righteous Lot\" II Peter 2:7). But what chance\n    did Abraham have against the ocean of invaders? Again, his knowledge of\n    warfare. He would know that once the invader's campaign was successful, the\n    kings and most of their soldiers would head for home at top speed. At a\n    much slower pace a small but adequate force would return with the vast\n    plunder and the many slaves. Possibly only 5,000 to 10,000 soldiers\n    remained, but still the odds were five or ten to one.\n</p>\n<p>\n    But Abraham had one more ace up his sleeve. He knew that discipline would\n    be almost non-existent now that the army had vanquished all opposition. The\n    coalition had been fighting for over a year. This was a time to celebrate\n    and those celebrations typically came in the form of nightly drunken orgies\n    at the expense of the female prisoners. Apparently even nighttime\n    reconnaissance patrols were neglected. From his days in Ur Abraham\n    understood the various plans for night watches, passwords, trumpet signals,\n    command structure, and camp layout. He also knew the typical contingency\n    plans for night attacks. In other words, he knew the military science of\n    Southern Mesopotamia. Further, he and senior members of his household knew\n    the various languages of Mesopotamia and could use those languages to get\n    inside the enemy's defenses. Further yet, he had grazed his flocks for\n    years through the entire area and knew every trail like the back of his\n    hand. Undoubtedly he sent scouts ahead to gather intelligence. Here in\n    abbreviated fashion is the scriptural account:\n</p>\n<p>\n    <strong>\n        And he divided his forces against them by night, he and his servants,\n        and defeated them and pursued them to Hobah, north of Damascus. Genesis\n        14:15.\n    </strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n    Abraham's plan was to strike in a night attack from multiple directions.\n    This plan employed a major strategy of military science-surprise. But it\n    also violated two principles-attacking at night and dividing one's force\n    against a superior force. It was very, very risky. There would be either\n    great reward or great loss. Abraham was the overall commander with three\n    Amorite bands taking orders from him. Possibly his force numbered 600-700.\n    Abraham and senior officers had to have gone over the plan in great detail.\n    They caught up with the invaders where the city of Dan would later be\n    established on the northern boundary of Israel about 110 air miles north of\n    Hebron. The forced march could hardly have been accomplished in four\n    exhausting days. Along the way they encountered injured and dead prisoners\n    and a trail of their discarded possessions. By the time they reached Dan,\n    though exhausted, they were highly motivated.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Abraham's night attack was a complete success. He could have found wounded\n    or dead soldiers along the way and taken their uniforms to dress some of\n    his troops to infiltrate their lines. Perhaps he impersonated a commander\n    of the invaders and gave guards contradictory orders, using his mastery of\n    the languages of Lower Mesopotamia and his intimate knowledge of their\n    military operations. Whatever strategy he used, he utterly surprised and\n    routed the invaders. He drove the fleeing confederation fifty miles, to a\n    place called Hobah somewhere north of Damascus. He knew that if the army\n    regrouped and counterattacked it would all be over for him and his allies.\n    No enemy soldier could be spared; it was either complete victory or\n    eventual disaster. Even one escapee could provide the information needed\n    for a retaliatory strike the next year.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <strong>Abraham's Best Defense</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n    The next spring when armies go to war found Abraham knotted up in fear.\n    This would be the time when the Mesopotamians would return to wreak\n    vengeance on him and his neighbors. Where does this idea come from? The\n    very next chapter records how God appears to him in a vision and said,\n    \"Fear not, Abram. I am your shield; your reward shall be very great.\"\n    (Genesis 15:1). Abraham had dared to strike the flower of Mesopotamia. Now\n    he feared the worst. But he did not have to fear because the God of\n    creation would be his shield. Further, apparently he was having second\n    thoughts about having lifted up his hand \"to the LORD God Most High,\n    Possessor [Creator] of heaven and earth, &#8230;not to take a thread or a\n    sandal strap or anything that [belonged to Sodom] lest [the king of Sodom]\n    should say, 'I have made Abram rich'\" Genesis 14:22-23. Had that been the\n    right thing to do? Yes, because for that stand God promised that his reward\n    would be <strong>very</strong> great.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <strong>75 Years of Preparation in Ur and Haran </strong>\n    (see also Appendix 3.4)<strong></strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n    Abraham's military skills point to many adult years in Ur, not the sleepy\n    village of Urfa 25 miles northwest of Haran while his altars point to years\n    of growing closer to the LORD in Haran. During the Haran years Terah's\n    influence waned while Abraham's influence grew. The vast numbers of\n    Abraham's cattle when he separated from Lot and the 318 shepherd/warriors\n    born in his house indicate that Abraham did not separate from his father's\n    household but rather influenced his father's household to worship the God\n    who led him to Canaan.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Genesis 14 provides a remarkable fit of Scripture and secular history with\n    regard to Abraham's early years. It records that the Sodom-Gomorrah\n    confederation had paid tribute to the king of Elam for 12 years. When they\n    did not pay in the 13<sup>th</sup>, the war machine from Mesopotamia came\n    to teach them a lesson in the 14<sup>th</sup> year led by Elam. The\n    campaign lasted two years. Secular history records that Ur reached its\n    zenith during the 97 golden-year rule of the five kings of the Third\n    Dynasty. It is an historical fact that its end came suddenly at the hands\n    of Elam. It broke Ur's control of the lower Euphrates in a military\n    invasion that overwhelmed the capital itself, burned its palace and\n    enslaved its population. In a strange and as yet not understood alliance\n    with other Mesopotamian powers only specifically reported in Scripture to\n    date, Elam extended its control all the way to Sodom and Gomorrah. Had\n    Abraham not left Ur in obedience to God, he would have lost his freedom and\n    wealth if not his life.\n</p>\n<p>\n    The timeline looks like this: Scripture clearly indicates the passing of 14\n    years, from the first year in which the pentapolis paid tribute to Elam\nuntil Elam and its allies arrived to punish them for not paying in the 13    <sup>th</sup>. The time needed to forge alliances and establish control\n    from Ur up the Euphrates and then down the Jordan Valley to the five cities\n    is unknown. This could have been accomplished in as little as a year or\n    two. Thus, an estimated minimum of 16 years passed from the fall of Ur to\n    the punishment dealt the five cities.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Sometime before the fall of Ur, God called Abraham. Upon responding to the\n    call he lived an unknown number of years in Haran. Then God led him from\n    Haran to Canaan and when Elam arrived to punish the rebels Abraham had been\n    in Canaan approximately nine years. This is known because of the next\n    sequence of events in Abraham's life: God's appearance in a vision and the\n    blood covenant the next spring, the birth of Ishmael a year later and the\n    birth of Isaac when Abraham was 100 and Ishmael was 14. Since Abraham was\n    75 when he arrived in Canaan, he would be 84 when the invaders defeated\n    Sodom and enslaved Lot.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Secular history gives various ranges of dates for the glorious years of the\n    Third Dynasty of Ur. The ancient cuneiform documents are consistent in\n    their records of the names of the five kings of the Third Dynasty, the\n    number of years each reigned and the major achievements of each. It was the\n    second of five that actually raised Ur to dominance. However, secular\n    history has been unable to anchor their 97-year total reign to a fixed\n    time. Instead it offers various ranges of dates, from early to late, to\n    moderate, etc. They differ by as much as at total of 155 years. The\n    earliest range ends at 2150 BC and the latest ends at 1995 BC. Abraham was\n    75 at 2091 so he fits well into the secular range of dates.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Two entire chapters of the Bible come out of Elam's rise (Genesis 14 and\n    15). Is that enough to set us thinking that maybe Abraham was an important\n    figure in Ur? Could it be that at the time of God's call, Abraham was well\n    into the politics or military of Ur and did not like the way negotiations\n    were going between his country and Elam? Could it be that due to the\n    growing problems facing Ur's leaders, he was not so certain about Ur's\n    future after all? Could it be that when God called, for the first time in\n    his life he might actually consider leaving Ur? We can only wonder but we\n    do know that God's timing is perfect.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Here is another thought to chew on: Elam's having conquered the Jordan\n    Valley just years before Abraham arrived in Canaan would explain why he\n    could move about so freely. The long established powers of the land had\n    been shaken to their roots and were busy recovering and rebuilding after\n    Elam swept through so they paid little attention to this man and his many\n    flocks and shepherds.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Finally, in an entire different vein, Elam only dominated Southern\n    Mesopotamia for a short time. Then in some as yet unexplained way the\n    alliance or one of its members turned on Elam and its power was broken in\n    that region until the rise of the Persian Empire 1500 years later. A\n    215-year sojourn in Egypt would place the birth of Abraham long after\n    Elam's dominance in Mesopotamia and Sodom. If that were the case, Genesis\n    14 would be fiction. Further, rivals of Ur governed that city-state once\n    Elam's control had been broken. So whether it was Elam or Ur's rivals, such\n    a time would not have been conducive to Terah and his relatives thriving in\n    Ur. If his kinsmen survived at all, it would have been because they fled\n    the country. If they returned, they would have been involved in picking up\n    the pieces and living under the control of various other powers and that is\n    not how secular sources pictures the Ur of Abraham's day.\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n    <strong>Scriptural Support that Abraham's Call Came in Ur</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n    We are convinced that God's call came to Abraham in Ur, not Haran, and that\n    he spent a number of years in Haran before God led him the rest of the way\n    to Canaan. But hyper literalists who bend all Scripture to the numbers in\n    Shem's genealogy reject this position. To support their 215-year Egyptian\n    sojourn view, they interpret the Apostle Paul's words in Galatians 3 to\n    mean that God called Abraham in Haran, not Ur and that he immediately\n    followed God to Canaan. Then 430-years later God gave Israel the Law on\n    Mount Sinai immediately following the Exodus. They interpret the details of\n    Abraham's life to fit this view. Book after book repeats this idea. The\n    Apostle is their only hope even though they misinterpret his argument. When\n    they deal with the four witnesses of chapter 2, they always start with\n    Paul.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Nevertheless, what saith the LORD? In the first half of this chapter we\n    showed that such a view is ruled out by the events in Abraham's life. The\n    rest of the chapter will look at specific statements of Scripture. The\n    information will be organized around eight Old Testament passages, one New\n    Testament passage and an argument from silence. These ten arguments show\n    beyond question the error of a Haran call and the 215-year sojourn behind\n    it.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <strong>Stephen Says \"Ur\"</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n    In the days following the resurrection of Christ, Stephen was full of grace\n    and power, doing great wonders and signs among the people. Those who\ndisputed with him could not withstand the wisdom and the    <strong><u>Spirit</u></strong> with which he spoke so they found people who\n    falsely charged that Stephen spoke blasphemous words against Moses and God\n    (Acts 6:8-11). This caused a disturbance that landed Stephen before the\n    council where additional false charges were made. Stephen defended himself\n    by reciting major events in the history of Israel, especially showing how\n    the nation had established a pattern of rejecting God's messengers, last of\n    all, the Messiah. Speaking by the Holy Spirit, he began with Jewish history\n    that none could deny:\n</p>\n<p>\n    <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>\n    <strong>\n        Brothers and fathers, hear me. The God of glory appeared to our father\nAbraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran,        <sup>3</sup>and said to him, \"Go out from your land and from your\n        kindred and go into the land which I will show you.\" <sup>4</sup>Then\n        he went out from the land of the Chaldeans and lived in Haran. And\n        after his father died, God removed him from there into this land. Acts\n        7:2-4.\n    </strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n    Stephen said exactly what this book maintains are the facts and which those\n    who add only numbers deny. His words are clear. They can't be interpreted\n    to mean something else. So, in this case the numerologists don't deny or\n    put a spin on what he said. Rather they say he made a slip of the tongue;\n    what he said was erroneous. They say that inerrancy only guarantees that\n    Stephen said these words, not that he had his facts straight. They say\n    maybe he was under pressure and was rattled or maybe he was a young\n    believer and didn't have a good grasp of the Old Testament. Somehow,\n    Stephen misstated. Their numbers supplant words.\n</p>\n<p>\n    It is true that inerrancy assures us of what someone said, even when they\n    speak error. For instance, God had told Adam he would die if he ate fruit\n    from a certain tree. Then the serpent said to Eve that she would not die if\n    she ate from that tree (Genesis 3:4). Scripture accurately reported that\n    the serpent said this even though what he said was untrue.\n</p>\n<p>\n    This interpretative tool is useful, but used wrongly is dangerous. It can\n    be used against any of the people in Scripture that said something the\n    critic disagrees with. There must be strong evidence that the speaker spoke\n    in error. Where is this evidence? Their only evidence is that it conflicts\n    with their interpretation of what Paul said in Galatians three. So they say\n    Paul was right; Stephen was wrong. We suggest both Stephen and Paul were\n    right. When Paul's words are correctly understood, his words will agree\n    completely with the words of Stephen. Invoking this extra ordinary use of\n    the principle of inerrancy is incredulous, strained. After all, Stephen was\n    full of the Holy Spirit:\n</p>\n<p>\n    <strong><sup>5</sup></strong>\n    <strong>\n        Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit. <sup>8</sup>\n        Stephen, full of grace and power, was doing great wonders and signs\n        among the people. <sup>10</sup>They could not withstand the wisdom and\n        the Spirit with which he was speaking. Acts 6:5, 8, 10.\n    </strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n    Recognizing that Stephen did speak accurately, others find a different\n    interpretation of Acts 7:4 in order to maintain Abraham was the firstborn\n    of Terah's sons. They observe that three personalities are found in verses\n    2-4: God, Terah and Abraham. While verse four speaks of \"his father,\" it\n    uses the personal pronoun four times. They say \"he removed him\" refers to\n    Abraham removing his father Terah, not God removing Abraham. So rather than\n    God leading Abraham on to Canaan after Terah died, this view says that\n    sixty years after Abraham arrived in Canaan, his father died. Abraham then\n    returned to Haran and brought his father's body to Canaan for burial. They\n    emphasize that this is consistent with the Hebrew mindset of the importance\n    of where one was buried and are adamant about this interpretation.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Such an explanation is strained and unnecessary. Why would Stephen begin\n    his address with where Abraham's father was buried rather than that God\n    Himself led the founder of the Jewish race to Canaan? This bad explanation\n    demonstrates just how far the numbers over words folks will go to uphold\n    their chronology from Shem to Abraham. They seem to suffer from\n    over-literalism. This chapter previously showed another example of\n    over-literalism. When Scripture says that at the age of 70 Terah fathered\n    three sons, Abraham, Nahor and Haran, it was not naming his sons in the\n    order of their birth, nor were they triplets, but they were named in the\n    order of their importance and that Abraham was the youngest.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Now for the eight Old Testament passages that indicate the call came in Ur.\n    Many times a single statement in the Bible is used to establish a biblical\n    truth. Two or three witnesses established a truth in a Jewish court of law.\n    Including the silence of Scripture we find ten to establish that Ur was the\n    country God called Abraham to leave.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <strong>Eight Old Testament Scriptures Argue for \"Ur\"</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n    1.<strong> Genesis 15:7.</strong> God Himself said He brought Abraham out\n    from Ur. If the call had come in Haran, God would have said \"I am the LORD\n    who brought you out of Haran.\"<strong></strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n    <strong>\n        And he said to him, \"I am the LORD who brought you out from Ur of the\n        Chaldeans to give you this land to possess.\" Genesis 15:7.\n    </strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n    2. <strong>Genesis 12:1.</strong> In the call God told Abraham to separate\n    from his father's household. That would make sense if the call came in Ur\n    because his father had compromised with the idolatry of that city and God\n    wanted to get Abraham away from his father's influence. But if the call\n    came in Haran after his father died, there would be no father with his\n    idolatry to separate from. Death would have done the job. Further, by the\n    time his father died, his father's household had turned from the idolatry\n    of Ur and was worshiping at Abraham's altar in Haran. In the end Abraham\n    and Lot inherited Terah's household.\n</p>\n<p>\n    3. <strong>Genesis 11:31. </strong>At God's prompting the journey began in\n    Ur, not Haran.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <strong>\n        Terah took Abram [Abraham] his son and Lot the son of Haran, his\n        grandson, and Sarai [Sarah] his daughter-in-law, his son Abram's wife,\n        and they went forth together from Ur of the Chaldeans to go into the\n        land of Canaan, but when they came to Haran, they settled there.\n    </strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n    This verse was written in retrospect. It clearly says they departed from\n    Ur, not Haran, to go to Canaan. While Terah was the patriarch and therefore\n    nominally in charge, his son Abraham was determined to obey God and go to a\n    land God would show him, so in effect, Terah was accompanying his son, not\n    leading his son.\n</p>\n<p>\n    4. <strong>Genesis 11:28</strong> says that \"Haran [Terah's oldest son]\n    died in the presence of his father Terah in the land of his kindred, in Ur\n    of the Chaldeans.\" Terah's kindred which we would call relatives lived in\n    Ur, not Haran. Since one of the conditions of God's call to Abraham was to\n    leave his kindred, the call must have come where Abraham's kindred\n    lived-Ur.\n</p>\n<p>\n    5. <strong>Genesis 11:27-25:11.</strong> Argument from the organization of\n    Genesis. The 215-year view notes that the death of Terah is recorded in\n    Genesis 11 while the call is recorded in Genesis 12. They conclude that the\n    call was issued after Terah's death. When they read \"Now the LORD said to\n    Abram&#8230;,\" they understand it to be saying, \"<strong>Then</strong> the\n    LORD said to Abram&#8230;\" Genesis 12:1. But, are these events sequential?\n    Does the fact that the record of the call follows the notice of Terah's\n    death prove God issued the call after Terah's death? Not at all.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Genesis arranges biographical material in logical groupings. First one life\n    or episode is stated, then another life or episode is presented. Terah's\n    life is presented in Genesis 11:27-32. Abraham's life follows in Genesis\n    12-25:11. This is followed by Ishmael's in Genesis 25:12-18, Isaac's in\n    Genesis 25:19-26:35, Jacob's in 27-35, Esau's in 36, then Joseph's and so\n    on. What could be more important in the Abraham section than his call?\n    Thus, the Abraham chapters begin with his call. The fact that Abraham's\n    call is recorded following the end of the section on Terah says nothing\n    about when it was issued.\n</p>\n<p>\n    6. <strong>Nehemiah 9:7-8. </strong>Other Old Testament books refer to\n    Abraham's country as Ur, not Haran. Abraham was told to leave his country.\n    Since his country was Ur, the call came when he was living there.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <strong><sup>7</sup></strong>\n    <strong>\n        You are the LORD, the God who chose Abram and brought him out of Ur of\n        the Chaldeans and gave him the name Abraham. <sup>8</sup>You found his\n        heart faithful before you and made with him the covenant to give to his\n        offspring the land of the Canaanite&#8230;.\n    </strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n    Nehemiah ranks high among pious Old Testament Jews in prominent places. He\n    mourned and wept with fasting and prayers for days when he heard that the\n    walls of Jerusalem had not been repaired. Then when he was performing his\n    task of setting wine before the emperor of the Persian Empire, Artaxerxes,\n    the king noticed his sadness. The story came out and Nehemiah was allowed\n    to go to Jerusalem to rebuild the walls. He organized those who had\n    returned to Jerusalem and in the face of much opposition, the walls were\n    rebuilt in just 52 days. Following this was a time of intense spiritual\n    renewal. He records the Levites praying the words quoted above. They\n    acknowledged that God had brought Abraham out of Ur of the Chaldeans. For\n    fifteen hundred years the descendants of Abraham had understood that God\n    first called Abraham in Ur and later in Canaan made a covenant with him to\n    give his descendants that land. God's bringing was from Ur, not from Haran.\n</p>\n<p>\n    7-8. <strong>Joshua 24:2-3. </strong>Two arguments come from these and\n    other verses:\n</p>\n<p>\n    <strong><sup>2</sup></strong>\n    <strong>\n        Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, \"Long ago your fathers lived\n        beyond the Euphrates, Terah, the father of Abraham and of Nahor, and\n        they served other gods. <sup>3</sup>Then I took your father Abraham\n        from beyond the River and led him through all the land of Canaan, and\n        made his offspring many&#8230;\" Joshua 24:2-3.\n    </strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n    Joshua specifically states that the fathers of Israel, Terah, Abraham and\n    Nahor, practiced idolatry (\"served other gods\") before God took Abraham\n    from where they lived \"beyond the Euphrates\" to Canaan. Their idolatry was\n    real. They did this in Ur. God broke Abraham's idolatrous ways by\n    separating him from the powerful idolatrous culture of Ur. In Haran Abraham\n    established the worship of the true God in Terah's household. This worship\n    continued during the lifetime of Isaac and was the faith Jacob was raised\n    in. On the other hand Nahor followed Terah and Abraham to the general area\n    around Haran but kept his idols. His grandson still held to them when Jacob\n    came to live with him. Abraham's break with idolatry began when he moved\n    from Ur, not from Haran. Therefore, the call came in Ur, not Haran.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Joshua's use of the phrase \"beyond the Euphrates\" also points to the call\n    coming in Ur, not Haran. Altogether this phrase or similar words occur a\n    dozen times more in Ezra and Nehemiah. The Euphrates is 1000 miles long. It\n    begins near the mountains of Armenia, flows somewhat west, curves south and\n    finally heads southeast to empty into the Persian Gulf. Haran is across the\n    Euphrates River but the expression is mostly used for more than simply\n    crossing the river. It is like a sweep of the hand to indicate a great\n    distance. In most of its occurrences this phrase refers to Lower\n    Mesopotamia. Thus it also confirms that the call came in Ur.\n</p>\n<p>\n    9. While Scripture specifically says the call came in Ur as seen in the\n    many references above, nowhere in the Old or New Testaments does it say or\n    even hint that the call came in Haran. Arguments from silence in themselves\n    do not establish a truth of Scripture. But when combined with positive\n    declarative statements, they do add validity to the concept under\n    consideration.\n</p>\n<p>\n    In summary, the conditions of Abraham's call, to leave country, kindred,\n    family and go to a land God would show him could only apply to the time\n    when Abraham lived in Ur. Why is that so important? Abraham had to replace\n    the idolatry that gripped Ur with faith in the one true God. Was he ready\n    for that? He was ready to leave his kindred and Ur, but leaving his\n    father's household was a road block. Refusing to stay behind they also\n    would need to leave their idol worship and that was not easily done. So\n    Haran became an important first step. It cannot be dismissed which the call\n    coming in Haran does. Hebrews 11 makes it clear that by faith Abraham\n    obeyed, going out to an unknown destination but ultimately expecting a city\n    with better foundations, one whose builder and maker is God. Exactly what\n    he left is very important: the world with all its idols, wealth and glamor.\n    That was Ur, not Haran.\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n    <strong>\n        Brief Chronology of Abraham --- Focusing on Elam's Defeat of Ur\n    </strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n    Overview: Based on 1876 BC arrival in Egypt (Dates BC):\n</p>\n<p>\n    2006 - Birth of Jacob\n</p>\n<p>\n    2066 - Birth of Isaac\n</p>\n<p>\n    2166 - Birth of Abraham\n</p>\n<p>\n    Firm (f) and estimated (e) dates for events in Abraham's early years:\n</p>\n<p>\n    2166f - Birth of Abraham in the country of Ur, Mesopotamia\n</p>\n<p>\n    2156f - Birth of Sarah\n</p>\n<p>\n    2131e - Abraham marries Sarah when she turns 25; he is 35\n</p>\n<p>\n    2111e - 2106e - No children after 20-25 years of marriage; Sarah is\n    obviously barren\n</p>\n<p>\n    2111e - 2106e - God calls Abraham to leave his country;\n</p>\n<p>\n    Abraham accompanied by his father's household follows God's leading\n</p>\n<p>\n    Abraham and Sarah with their father's household settle in Haran\n</p>\n<p>\n    <strong> 2100e - Approximate year that Elam crushes Ur</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\n    2097e - Elam puts the Jordan Valley pentapolis under tribute\n</p>\n<p>\n    2091f - Terah dies; Abraham is 75; God leads him from Haran to Canaan\n</p>\n<p>\n    2082e - Mesopotamian armies defeat Jordan Valley pentapolis; Abraham\n    rescues Lot\n</p>\n<p>\n    2081f - God's promises and prophecy to Abraham in Genesis 15\n</p>\n<p>\n    2080f - Birth of Ishmael\n</p>\n<p>\n    2066f - Birth of Isaac (when Abraham is 100 and Ishmael is 14)\n</p>\n`\n}"]}]}
